2890000 sono stati proprio i munk gruppo elettronico tedesco molto divertente a cercarmi
2890001 america is is no longer uh what it could be what it it once was
2890002 and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2890003 no sabes lo que anhelo poder salir del hospital quisiera aprovechar el poco tiempo que me queda para hacer el bien a mis semejantes
2890004 motherhood gave me a big creative energy but most of all a reason for what i do a bigger reason than just personal reward
2890005 my goal or what makes me happy in life is directing and that s something i found out in doing or actually before doing scarlet diva
2890006 its weird because all my life ive written out of deep sadness and misery and now that im very close to happiness its more difficult
2890007 music has always been my fixation more than cinema i was shaped by the things that my sister who used to be a dj listened to she put on from heavy metal to rap
2890008 i never had dreams that something incredible was going to come and change my life
2890009 in the past i used to be very aggressive to see what it would lead to and what i could bring out of people by saying outrageous controversial things just to see their reaction i was testing my limits and the audiences limits and now i don t have that fantasy anymore i don t have that urge anymore it doesnt give me anything to do that in the past i was more rebellious been there done that
2890010 when i was pregnant with my first child i read that after 6 months babies can feel the music in the womb so i listened to a lot of beatles and beach boys and i even put the boxes close to the belly and i have to say that the effect is true because when she was born and had colics i put yellow submarine on and she calmed down even to this day she asks me to listen to it
2890011 yes but i dont want to feed these ugly things that are published in the newspapers theyre really vulgar one day i know that ill regret it especially because of my daughter one needs a little more discretion and dignity in life these declarations degenerate later so i prefer to let it pass
2890012 music yet again an album by the german munk was released not so long ago i wrote 3 songs and also shot a video with them a very strong piece of music im proud of the first single because thats my text and ive also sung it and theres another work of mine with the french archigram antipop thats out these days but i dont have ambitions as a singer thats all about people i knew who asked me to collaborate with them and i agreed in the next days ill record some rock songs with that artist that i like whos called the legendary tigerman he comes from portugal and hes a one man band but from june 2nd to august 2nd im on radio 2 every morning from 9 30 am to 11 am alongside gianfranco monti
2890013 anything im very interested in exchanging opinions with the listeners
2890014 next fall ill have a role in the and im very happy about it and then ill work on a long feature film entirely mine which will be produced in france and that ill film in 2009
2890015 theres so much i want to understand and i dont do analysis i dont have a psychologist i dont have the practical chores either you know my life is totally impossible and by making a movie about it maybe i can forgive myself
2890016 he gave me a taste for beauty and some aesthetics and thats definitely there and im proud of it but at the same time i have a completely different style as a filmmaker from my father whos very classic and really knows the old machine of cinema and im more into a new way of filmmaking very light very free very detached from the rules to destroy the rules but it comes definitely from a sense of beauty and some aesthetics that are in my blood
2890017 we met five years ago in the united states but we were both in other relationships we remained friends and we met again when we were both single last year its the first time that it happens to me that a simple friendship blossoms into love i want to get married but hes italian american and the burocracy here in italy is very complicated
2890018 i wish i had never made it my scene was exploited and people only talked about it
2890019 italian women are thought of as being sexy but im more than just that clich
2890020 i was a child actor but i was a strange looking kid in italy they call it the beauty of the donkey
2890021 its strange because when i see my fathers movies i see the women in his movies before i was even born they all look like me thats why i think that maybe he gave me birth to have a lead in his movies
2890022 i hate elevating acting to something its not like a lot of americans do theres no mystery its only a job like everything else
2890023 some actors some very stupid actors believe that the uglier they look the better they are as an actor i used to believe in that too
2890024 motherhood gave me a big creative energy but most of all a reason for what i do a bigger reason than just personal reward
2890025 there is no balance between those who hate me and those who love me the first ones are numerous the second ones are a minority
2890026 as somebody who did everything but didnt know how to do anything

2890030 a lot of things are going to happen with danny that dont involve lindsay but shes going to come to the rescue and still be a part of that relationship
2890031 hell recur for several episodes and of course hell be very attractive
2890032 i happen to enjoy patd as much as i enjoy the p
2890033 sounds great but you have to guard your feelings though im sorry but i just want you to be happy you deserve it
2890034 we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective
2890035 sorry mr bird but we dont really want you in the three point contest during our all star weekend
2890036 sorry michael jordan but we dont really think youd add much excitment to the slam dunk contest weve already got a guy thats going to attempt a dunk with a blindfold on sounds pretty exciting huh so anyway maybe next time
2890037 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
2890038 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
2890039 unless we can find a route to low carbon growth then we face either catastrophic climate change or serious economic decline
2890040 sudah ya kamu pulang saja jangan ganggu raissa ia masih kecil dan ingin istirahat
2890041 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2890042 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2890043 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2890044 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2890045 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2890046 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2890047 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2890048 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2890049 this is on top of the 3 5 percent gain over june both largely on the back of the banking stocking stocks which have added confidence to growing belief that the bourse has at last bottomed
2890050 these signs are good domestic prices are moving up more stocks are trading regularly
2890051 the largest annual depreciation was 14 2 percent against the euro and the least was 2 3 percent against the us dollar while remaining unchanged against the pound
2890052 bernie mac had the ability to effortlessly make people laugh
2890053 he was an incredible talent with whom my colleagues and i in aafca always looked forward to covering bernie had a big heart and he will certainly be missed by the members of our organization
2890054 the loss of isaac hayes less than 24 hours after bernie mac represents a major double blow to the entire entertainment industry black hollywood in particular
2890055 the art form and expressions created by isaac hayes in particular resonated not only in american pop culture but throughout american life both are talents that will be missed but always remembered
2890056 we created a demand and a niche even 12 years ago but at first people thought what is the use of learning these western dance forms in india
2890057 people were hearing this new type of music in bars and had no idea how to react
2890058 they come to us to learn how to dance to it just want to create a place for learning and exploring it
2890059 shiva had once before asked agni to carry his conception which agni had sworn never to do again
2890060 our inability to get a runner in from third with less than two outs killed us today
2890061 theyre going good and feeling good when things are going right for you you win these games
2890062 when things are going bad you lose these games thats whats happening with us
2890063 there are no excuses it was a devastating series for us
2890064 every game is a playoff game from now on were really going to show what this team is made of character wise
2890065 weve come up with so many situations where we havent gotten that extra hit
2890066 i think it would be foolish to just wait back and let the game come to us youve got to play to win
2890067 if we can take two of three from here on out well be sitting pretty
2890068 i was hoping wed play a little wed get rain theyd take him out and wed get to the bullpen early it didnt work out that way
2890069 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2890070 no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2890071 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2890072 it probably took us less than five minutes to get the balloon airborne
2890073 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
2890074 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
2890075 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
2890076 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
2890077 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
2890078 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
2890079 it is a phenomenal achievement he mendis came in when murali muttiah muralitharan needed support and he rose to the occasion well he has gone beyond our expectations and the important thing for him is to keep learning
2890080 i am very happy to get a hundred it was one of the most difficult hundreds to get we now want to keep them india well below the 100 mark when we go out there tomorrow
2890081 its disappointing that we have not performed as a batting unit these are the guys who have won games for india its just a matter of not clicking i dont know how it happened
2890082 its a good wicket to bat on and i hope we bat well tomorrow we are looking forward to a good partnership in the morning
2890083 the bowlers still havent really been where we know they can be and it will be a good time tomorrow to hit their straps
2890084 if we can pick up a couple of early ones i dont see why we cant push through
2890085 it was a pretty good wicket to bat on today
2890086 the ovals a quick scoring ground and if we get our heads down and bat well 197 is something we should certainly knock off its been a good week for kev so far and weve got the chance to make it a very good week for him
2890087 i just tried to keep scoring because we had andre nel at the other end who is a real tailender
2890088 pulling the team out of trouble is all i want to do this 97 is as good as 150 for me today im very happy to have given the boys a chance to pull through
2890089 joey cheek has just got to know that i took the sudanese message for him to the
2890090 and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish
2890091 a place where dancing in a truck bed while beer bonging a cure for the hangover from the night before is not uncommon
2890092 finishing college is a big thing they cant take that away from you my grandma raised me to go to college and finish college
2890093 i have a little crazy side to me sometimes and its hard to let it out when youre playing receiver
2890094 anytime i thought that we were breaking away from the pack theyd be right there on the next straight the draft here is so important you see cars five or six car lengths back and theyd be in passing position by the next corner overall it was a really fun race this place is easily one of my top three favorite tracks in the country to race at
2890095 they give me everything i need to run up front they do so much work theyre here early they stay late we go over data after every session on the track they have a solid game plan everywhere we go and i hope we continue to do well at the remaining races
2890096 ryans been quick all week so my objective was just to get up there and help him i didnt know if that was going to even be possible i had a really good start and worked my way up to ryan we made a real conscious effort to try and get away the first couple of laps but we realized it wasnt going to happen we learned a lot about a track like this drafting wise the first couple of laps we got schooled pretty bad we fell back to fourth and fifth but then we figured out a pretty good method ryan and i have been working well together all year hes a great teammate and im real proud of him
2890097 we started on pole went back to third went back to the front went back to third but it was fun everybody raced pretty clean for what it was really tight close racing i got bumped a whole bunch but i think everybody did
2890098 the lat campaign robert f kennedy and 82 days that inspired america
2890099 theres a huge window thats open and i do believe theyve got to close that
2890100 the new security proposals must be workable and should strike the right balance between the need for security and for mobility
2890101 weve worked very closely with industry to garner as much input with respect to what is operationally feasible
2890102 provide a standard of security for a community that doesnt have one right now
2890103 the board believes that this offer is an opportunity to increase the long term value of our stock for our stockholders while at the same time providing stockholders who wish to tender some or all of their shares a way to do so efficiently
2890104 dear sirs i am an enthusiast but not a crank in the sense that i have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine i wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then if possible add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success
2890105 try not to nerd yourself to death while im gone
2890106 lmao what if thats her it looks like she has a penis i have a lot of hate for megan fox
2890107 we usually reserve a push for 1000m and another with 750m to go but we called it before each marker because we knew the pace was very hot
2890108 theres nothing wrong with us were still flying we just got beaten
2890109 in world cup competitions we do one possibly two races on a friday have a semi on saturday and a final on sunday so thats three to four races in three days
2890110 the world championships and olympics are different because everything is spread out its sort of a luxury having days in between so were well able for it
2890111 always spoke to the people and was at home in anybodys company
2890112 we are here today to celebrate the life of a great man a man who had great affection and appreciation for his adopted area
2890113 off screen he remained a family man he valued the privacy that he had found in tourmakeady he had a deep affection for the landscape and the people of mayo and would be absolutely delighted that he is being commemorated locally
2890114 the way padraig played at birkdale especially the back nine on sunday was very impressive
2890115 it seems pretty obvious after hes open champion twice that padraig has the mental strength determination and now has got the experience to go on and win again
2890116 when you win that first major you dont want to be a one hit wonder but being a multiple major winner is a different mindset
2890117 you forget about being on empty on days like these
2890118 monday is the day to feel exhausted you know you can give 100pc today
2890119 i got up at 4 30 and started doing my exercises jumping around the place and trying to wake everybody
2890120 i was disappointed as i thought id hit is very close it drifted a little on the wind and i wasnt worried as i thought wed taken plenty of club
2890121 i was surprised to find it in the sand but it was a pretty easy bunker shot and i messed it up
2890122 it was a slow start to the second part of my round but the four birdies in the middle got it going i holed some putts in that run which was nice to see happening it was good to get some feeling on the greens
2890123 i dont know what will come out of the bag but hopefully it will be more like this morning
2890124 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2890125 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2890126 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2890127 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2890128 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2890129 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2890130 after last year we went to extra efforts and preparations and put down tracks we brought in from
2890131 its amazing that two years ago we had exactly the same weather its never come as bad in a century and it arrived at the same time this year
2890132 competitors come from all over the country and we didnt want people to be disappointed and theyd have to be able to get in and out of the car parks
2890133 unfortunately we cant just postpone it for four or five days its not like a football match
2890134 we will convene a meeting as soon as we can in the next day or so and decisions will be made
2890135 it is with regret that i learned of the death of colm condon my sincere sympathies go to his wife jacqueline and his family

2890143 de groei wordt vooral gerealiseerd bij jongeren en oudere mensen
2890144 de belangrijkste verklaring voor de stijging is dat steeds meer mensen gaan shoppen op de gsm markt ze volgen de aanbiedingen van de operatoren nauwkeurig en gaan zowel een simkaart nemen bij degene die gratis smsjes aanbiedt als bij degene die gratis belminuten geeft
2890145 in bepaalde zones die onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de soldaten van russische vredesmacht vallen dichtbij tskhinvali was er een actieve confrontatie

2890156 now is the time for 2020 vision for our sector we are calling on prime minister rudd to acknowledge the need to address this as a national issue if australia is to continue to prosper
2890157 insufficient and will not close the gap on future demands for skilled ict workers
2890158 the industry has been sounding the alarm on skills for a number of years and unfortunately we are now close to tipping point on this issue
2890159 this is a situation that urgently requires a long term partnership between governments and industry for the economic benefit of all australians
2890160 the report shows the consistent growth of the ict industry and its role in the success of the economy australia can no longer view ict in isolation and this requires a whole of government approach under the leadership of prime minister rudd
2890161 shed light on the specific skills needed to ease ict skills shortages in the next five to 10 years to help inform appropriate policies for the industry
2890162 the ict skills shortage needs to be better understood as it will have a long term effect on australias economic performance unfortunately the most likely outcome on current settings shows continued and rapidly growing ict skills shortages which would inevitably translate into reduced economic performance for all australian industry sectors

2890188 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2890189 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi growth
2890190 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk

2890200 its going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2890201 great guy as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense thats a plus
2890202 i think the biggest thing is weve gotten better since then from a personnel standpoint
2890203 obviously with patrick willis inside that exposes the guys next to him a lot
2890204 i think it showed some glimpses of what i can do

2890424 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

2890539 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
2890540 and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2890541 and i was very firm with vladimir putin just like i was firm with the russian president
2890542 there needs to be a international mediation there for the south ossetia issue

2890567 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point

2890571 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny
2890572 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic
2890573 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2890574 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2890575 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2890576 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important

2890624 f r mich ist br nn immer ein ganz besonderes wochenende
2890625 erstens ist es eine der sch nsten strecken im ganzen gp kalender und zweitens sind jedes jahr sehr viele freunde und fans aus sterreich in br nn mit dabei die ich oft das ganze jahr nicht sehe
2890626 2007 lief es in br nn ganz gut und ich konnte lange mit den spitzenleuten mithalten am ende fehlte nicht sehr viel nach vorne und ich wurde achter
2890627 mit einem hnlichen ergebnis w re ich heuer wahrscheinlich nicht unzufrieden mal sehen ich werde auf jeden fall alles versuchen um eine einigerma en gute zweite saisonh lfte zu fahren vielleicht hilft mir auch mein team dabei
2890628 grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and the bombing outside of south ossetia
2890629 my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire
2890630 100 focused on solving this peacefully we respect georgias territorial integrity and we expect russia to do the same
2890631 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2890632 this situation could be resolved peacefully so they have held that door open
2890633 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2890634 now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop mountaintop removal
2890635 im saying were going to have it stopped by the end of next year the end of 2009
2890636 if the american people knew what was happening in appalachia i feel certain that they would demand an end to this practice
2890637 i think if we get a new president itll be stopped and i guess were going to get a new president by next year
2890638 i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time
2890639 how can they approve the filling of hundreds and a couple thousand miles of mountain streams in this region and say thats not significantly degrading the water
2890640 all i can say is the corps hasnt been doing its job up until now
2890641 i wouldnt be able to comment on what we think the 4th circuits going to rule but that appeal and those four individual permits do not affect the army corps ability to issue further individual permits and they have been doing that
2890642 the plaintiffs again have filed suit over those and that is still in litigation
2890643 have we issued any coal mining permits since the ruling yes we have do we feel it complies with the judges ruling yes we do
2890644 in the regulatory department we follow the rules and regulations as passed on to us by congress and the judges whatever they decide is what we will do we are neither for projects nor against projects
2890645 they would still be able to do traditional surface mining which is what we call contour surface mining where they mine around the mountains and reclaim the land when theyre done
2890646 they put the material back up into the mined area
2890647 it would be devastating and not just to southwest virginia counties it would impact washington county it would impact the tri cities area the coal dollar flows in lots of directions
2890648 when you live in a mountainous region sometimes you appreciate the flat land
2890649 weve got airports weve got housing developments weve got shopping centers because of land flattened by mining
2890650 one of the reasons we pushed so hard for circulating fluidized bed clean coal technology for this power station is its ability to burn a wide variety of fuels
2890651 we will be able to design our fuel plan around a wide range of coal waste coal and biomass and can make adjustments as the market for those fuels changes
2890652 the next administration could clarify the federal regulations and make it clear that mountaintop removal mining was never foreseen when the surface mining laws were passed and is not permitted under those laws
2890653 jeg er villig til at se p om reglen kan forts tte eller skal ndres folk f ler sig kr nkede over at helt unge slipper billigt fra at beg meget afstumpet vold og endda vise billeder af det til deres venner

2890655 vi er n dt til at dr fte den dom politisk og lave lovgivningen om der bliver flere og flere helt unge der beg r modbydelige og skruppell se forbrydelser og de fortjener en voksen straf der kan m rkes og sender et klart signal til andre unge om at vi ikke vil acceptere det rabat ordningen for unge under 18 skal v k jeg vil bede justitsministeren komme med et lovforslag om det og hvis hun ikke g r det kommer jeg med det selv
2890656 ud fra en almindelig l gmandsbetragtning n r man lige ser det kan man godt blive forbl ffet over at en s alvorlig forbrydelse kan ende med en s mild straf

2890669 more than seven in ten pro choice mccain supporters have yet to learn that mccains position on abortion is directly at odds with their own
2890670 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
2890671 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
2890672 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
2890673 love to see a point where roe is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
2890674 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own party
2890675 i believe we are an inclusive party and we can be so without changing our principles
2890676 a private decision that we would share within our family and not with anyone else

2890689 they prove that the free markets remain the best instruments to defeat poverty and increase prosperity
2890690 i am happy to share my felicitations with the two million americans who have come from
2890691 today i join with indian american communities across our country in celebrating the 61 has one of its most important relationships in an uncertain world
2890692 america is indias largest trading and investment partner and both countries are working to protect their people and their values from 21 st century threats while at the same time respecting the rule of law and cultural pluralism
2890693 public health education agriculture energy strategic cooperation and technology are only a few of the fields where we should continue to work jointly
2890694 indian americans have been strong contributors to the local communities they have settled in around the country
2890695 they balance love of the homeland with a strong commitment to america and their knowledge skills values and entrepreneurial spirit have immeasurably benefited both countries
2890696 these efforts have played a significant role in creating a blueprint for bilateral relations that bring our nations closer
2890697 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people his victory in has inspired generations of young people around the world to pursue freedom in their own countries
2890698 as freedom faces challenges in many parts of the world his example is even more relevant this enduring legacy is one of the great gifts of in a simultaneous message issue congratulating s people share hopes and dreams that are similar to americans as pakistani american communities demonstrate yours is a culture of hard work entrepreneurship and love of community a culture that places a high value on education family faith and service to society
2890699 as lawyers and other professionals lead in turn purchases many american goods and services
2890700 the partnership is built on the work of pakistani americans who balance love of the homeland with a strong commitment to their knowledge skills values and entrepreneurial spirit have proved immeasurably beneficial to both countries
2890701 as the pakistani people work to perfect their democracy they have an important ally in the
2890702 why i have co sponsored legislation tripling non military aid to the pakistani people and sustaining it for a decade
2890703 working with the pakistani american community i am hopeful that the
2890704 there has been a lot of interest on whether soy affects fertility because many studies in animals suggest that this is the case but there are very few studies in humans
2890705 this only the third study to look at whether soy food has a relationship with fertility in humans and the first one to find an association in agreement to the animal studies
2890706 isoflavones are structurally similar to estrogen and can mimic the action of estrogen in the body
2890707 soy is expected to have estrogen like activity in many organs and tissues which can be beneficial for some things but its certainly not beneficial for sperm production at least thats what animal models suggest
2890708 there was an inverse association between soy food intake and sperm concentration that remained significant after accounting for age abstinence time body mass index caffeine and alcohol intake and smoking
2890709 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2890710 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2890711 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2890712 two crews came back in to merlin here they will not be fighting that complex for a while and these crews that came back were actually on a different fire i believe the employees are having a closed door employee meeting to bring everyone together
2890713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2890714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2890715 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2890716 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2890717 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2890718 my dream is to make bihar the vegetable hub of the country i want to see vegetables in the name of brand bihar in the every plate of indians
2890719 the family was upset initially then we thought that he has always done well and will do well in future too
2890720 we completely understand the need for silence when dealing with said issues
2890721 second life fashion bloggers are valued and sought after to showcase items for many designers but that is where the respect seems to end we hold designers in such high regard
2890722 we hope that people will help us in the future
2890723 i saw anthony take a very labored swing in his third at bat
2890724 and when he followed through it was evident that his hamstring was bothering him
2890725 the game is always about the players who are here about the guys in the lineup
2890726 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2890727 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2890728 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2890729 i know the peoples pulse they are waiting for me to announce the launch of my party chiranjeevi told reporters
2890730 acid sensitive channel inhibition prevents fetal alcohol spectrum disorders cerebellar purkinje cell loss
2890731 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells
2890732 it was just nice to have both sides of the ball operating efficiently to start the game
2890733 you can say something was wrong with him but he hasnt missed a beat this year
2890734 he looked poised for a young guy and mike has to be happy with his quarterback coming out and looking fairly sharp
2890735 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2890736 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2890737 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2890738 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2890739 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2890740 i dont know if it will be as much as the first group goes or if hell just take a few snaps but well see how he feels here
2890741 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2890742 kimos just got to get himself right and we can always bring kimo back if we need to later
2890743 right now its not the time to get confident or cocky
2890744 camp might be breaking but we have three weeks of preseason left now is when youre going to really turn it on this is when the coaches want to see who keeps going who keeps getting better
2890745 he said it was just a fluke deal and said he got it trapped under a guys foot or stepped funny and rolled over it
2890746 everything is pretty well fine other than the fact he has stitches
2890747 he was in good spirits last night when i spoke with him and hes anxious to get back
2890748 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2890749 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2890750 theres still interest in takeo like ive been saying all along
2890751 but other than that i dont have any specifics thats where we are right now
2890752 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
2890753 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
2890754 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
2890755 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
2890756 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue
2890757 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2890758 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi growth
2890759 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
2890760 the conversion of the said lands is ongoing notwithstanding the issuance of cloa certificate of land ownership agreement by the dar all of the cases filed against the two powerful clans remain unsolved or have been dismissed by the courts
2890761 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2890762 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2890763 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone

2890765 are you joking me this is friggin mcdonalds i am contacting the kroch family
2890766 each one of those flags represents one person in bay county whos going to be diagnosed with cancer this year
2890767 our goal is 250 000 this year so were hoping to come in really close to that last year we raised 221 000
2890768 i felt like getting donations for everyone who needs it
2890769 we do it every year to keep it going and help fight cancer
2890770 parents who smoke can be role models by quitting smoking
2890771 more than 10 million americans alive today are cancer survivors
2890772 early detection can prevent nearly 90 percent of colon cancer cases and deaths
2890773 its quite a reward when you stop and think aboutwhat you would have missed
2890774 im a survivor for five years next month of ovarian cancer and i just like to tell everybody listen to their bodies if anythings off rhythm or abnormal go to your doctor
2890775 im never going to get to meet my boyfriends dad because he passed away from lung cancer at the age of 41 also my grandma survived breast cancer twice
2890776 i can ride down and visit the neighbor if i want to or make an errand to the grocery store or go look at deer at night
2890777 the machines arent meant be on roads and our roads arent set up to accommodate those things
2890778 were trying to provide an opportunity for people to come up north and contribute to our economy google is not going to move to west branch
2890779 we dont want a lot of people going home angry because they got a ticket because of confusion
2890780 the first step is education and were going to have to do some work on the ground
2890781 were gearing up now to do as much mitigation as we can
2890782 we havent seen that in the counties that have had orv ordinances
2890783 most people will just ride as a casual thing to visit their neighbor or to go from their home to the trail system
2890784 bay county will evaluate whether or not this would be appropriate after weve had discussions with the sheriff the state police and local township leaders
2890785 weve seen a couple of people from the oscoda area on the fence about buying an all terrain vehicle but as soon as the law was approved they came in and bought two of them
2890786 now a guy can go out and ride the trails and he doesnt have to load it up to go get gas or go to a restaurant
2890787 people can ride their quad from our parking lot and the majority do that as opposed to trailering it
2890788 this is an important milestone for working families in bay county who are struggling to get access to quality affordable health care
2890789 basic health service delivery system for the prevention and treatment of health problems of uninsured and underinsured residents of the county
2890790 some people think if you need health care youre not working and thats not true
2890791 in just a few short years genesee county went from covering less than 3 percent of the uninsured to more than 67 percent
2890792 emergency room visits to local hospitals dropped 38 percent and patients reported fewer health problems and a significant reduction in prescription drug costs the success of the genesee plan can happen right here in bay county once voters approve the initiative on nov 4
2890793 were going to develop a major new industry that will serve all the great lakes and possibly other places in the world
2890794 its where we can really say we can get 100 percent of our net annual energy from
2890795 its a heck of a lot easier than drilling for oil
2890796 studies show that the great lakes hold a great potential for wind power development
2890797 its a matter of time before a project like this moves forward
2890798 were certainly interested in seeing if there are ways of making that happen and making it happen in a way thats not disruptive to other users ourselves and the natural ecology of the lakes
2890799 i dont think that many people think windmills are ugly maybe one in 10
2890800 most people like to look at windmills just like they like to look at sailboats
2890801 because the wind resources are the publics resources the water resources are the publics resources
2890802 the county of bay is not going to get into any kind of venture of this sort thats just not our mission
2890803 weve got guys who are natural shooters they dont need any training
2890804 im not that guy everything ive done comes from training and putting a lot of rounds down range
2890805 the first one bedazzles you and the second one i thought i had a chance to win a medal but this has really been my best season

2890811 i am so proud that i am going back to school in a couple of weeks
2890812 it all seems to have started back three years ago when my grandson was killed
2890813 a lot of people dont realize that you can prevent bad things from happening by just locking your doors and calling the police if you see something suspicious
2890814 we were invited by the city police and are happy to cooperate in educating the public about public safety
2890815 we are no longer exercising the option to buy the property on m 15 and build a wal mart there
2890816 i dont feel i won i feel the people of portsmouth township and all the small business owners won
2890817 this is great news it means were going to save farmland and it means were not going to lose local jobs and not going to duplicate services with another wal mart down the road
2890818 the news that wal mart has decided not to pursue construction in portsmouth township is very disappointing
2890819 portsmouth township officials have always maintained the issue was not about wal mart as the developer but about development in general by a major company in an area that has been designated for commercial growth for over 30 years
2890820 it was coming out in the next week or two and we wanted to pull out so it would allow them to keep it in public act 116 they had that option
2890821 we dont know what exactly has turned the tide in some areas for georgia
2890822 but we do know from reliable satellite surveillance that russian forces in the region of the roki tunnel were driven in a route back into their homeland without any georgian troops in the vicinity
2890823 math u sees goal is to help produce confident problem solvers who enjoy the study of math

2890837 for all the talk about the private sector taking off in iraq it didnt materialize
2890838 people would say well these people are poor we need to help them its true but we didnt create jobs i think this is a huge problem
2890839 since advances in technology particularly that in computer technology in recent years have re arranged the boundaries between so many disciplines we of course reflect this by strongly embracing art that could not be produced without making use of these new opportunities
2890840 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2890841 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2890842 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2890843 a long time ago i was cleaning my face after a night of working in many places with different kinds of makeup

2890845 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2890846 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2890847 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2890848 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2890849 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every mm of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2890850 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2890851 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2890852 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2890853 the sea ice is becoming more vulnerable to further retreat as ice thickness is very uniform over large regions and ice reduction can be very fast once a certain threshold thickness is reached

2890891 while the focus of tb control is on prompt case detection and effective treatment better housing conditions and reduced levels of crowding also have a role in controlling the spread of this disease
2890892 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2890893 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of these bacteria via small airborne droplets
2890894 household crowding increases opportunities for active cases to infect other household members particularly children

2890915 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium
2890916 i felt i was a good racer and that was my goal going in but i would have liked to have put my hand on the wall first because it was so close
2890917 the 400 im used to be that big thing in my life now i feel like with my freestyles and my other events ive spread out what i really focus on
2890918 the 400 im has just become another one of my events
2890919 i feel like i handled it at trials pretty well you never know what your limits are until you go over them
2890920 im going to keep trying to do my best and see what happens
2890921 but you know getting a bronze does leave me still a little bit hungry so it will drive me all week
2890922 i felt like i had to take it out faster than normal my first 100 was almost a second faster than normal
2890923 i felt to even be in the race i kind of needed to do that
2890924 the 200 im will be a little different because i can take it out there and maybe not be as tired

2890928 the pacific has lost a leader who had the region at heart he was a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
2890929 its an amazing experience and ive got absolutely no intention of giving it away
2890930 i dont intend to retire in the next term of government or opposition
2890931 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
2890932 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us
2890933 the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2890934 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
2890935 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to a half a meter between the two sets of players
2890936 all i know is that if there is a rule and if it applies to one team it applies to both teams
2890937 the referee has to blow according to the rules and not according to his interpretation its that simple
2890938 if i looked at reserve scrumhalf and i have to choose between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez and i sent fourie back i would have to have my head read
2890939 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn i told ruan and frans it is great to have you here but if fourie or jaque are back then you are at the back of the queue again
2890940 i told them you can go back and decide where you want to play but with every decision there is a responsibility and that responsibility is that if you choose to play flyhalf you must know there are players ahead of you
2890941 the same goes for scrumhalf there you must know bolla conradie fourie and ricky januarie are all ahead of you
2890942 ruan is a very good player but as a scrumhalf i have to ask if he does all the basic things that a scrumhalf has to do
2890943 this is what i look for and i have to be honest about these things if ruan and frans were playing badly then it would be easier but they arent playing badly
2890944 the coach is possibly wrong but i have to choose and stick by my decision both are great players but there are players here who have a little bit extra because they are specialists
2890945 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2890946 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2890947 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2890948 we took him out and are just easing him back in
2890949 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2890950 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
2890951 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
2890952 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2890953 you know how we do it were going to evaluate what we see based on performance
2890954 it is also clear that we have a significant opportunity for incremental growth in our retail business which we can best realize with best buy on fcc fines retailers manufacturers combined 6 6m for violating
2890955 best buy voluntarily pulled all analog only tuner products from our stores on oct 1 2007 in a proactive effort to prevent confusion and to help
2890956 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
2890957 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
2890958 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
2890959 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
2890960 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
2890961 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back
2890962 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in us army captain luis montalvan who retired from the army last year after 17 years service and recently set up an association to help iraqi refugees
2890963 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
2890964 we feel its our nations responsibility to help ivraa is a way to correct some mistakes
2890965 i feel a bit responsible as a former military officer for some of the displacement of iraqis
2890966 based on the documents presented to them they believe salah qualifies for the special immigration visa because its been shown he served as an interpreter for coalition forces

2890972 but compared with his attending the olympic games the profit is much larger than the loss
2890973 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2890974 china will be a better place if there is more freedom of religion
2890975 god works slowly according to our individual needs better than anyone he knows that doing it all at once would reduce us to shivering panic
2890976 we hope to set a model for other denominations about how to face this dark tragic part of our history because we believe that only when you repent can you move on

2890982 just a huge relief it feels like a big relief off my shoulders im sure it is for everybody in this room standing next to us because weve committed a lot to it ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mom and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day
2890983 two speeding penalties and wrecking at the end equals a very frustrating day
2890984 im excited and im glad to put an end to all the rumors and get rid of all the speculation and solidify my position at dei im looking forward to running the bass pro shops no 1 the rest of this year and next year im looking forward to doing great things with the company and moving forward
2890985 michael waltrip is a terrific spokesman and brand ambassador for napa auto parts
2890986 in fact our research indicates that michael waltrip and napa auto parts have become synonymous to many race fans
2890987 we have been running well and we just needed some luck on our side and some good strategy jimmy has brought that along
2890988 were in the top 35 and thats been our big deal
2890989 i know once we get in were not going to fall back out
2890990 and i hope it can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2890991 its just a great weekend all around i thought yesterday was great but when i wound up there on that red flag i realized where i was i was behind tony and in front of all those other great drivers we came up out of the truck so well yesterday in practice we were too scared to change anything and the car was flopping around a lot during the race it had a lot of grip it was just real tough to drive so i just tried to stay clean as best i could there and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it you know i really had no idea where we were at until the last pit stops we cycled through about sixth place so its just a great day all along im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a piece that i could get out there and give it my best and little debbie and the mckee family for giving me the chance to go cup racing i dont want to be labeled a road racer by the way too i am 10th in the nationwide series points so im trying to make it as a nascar driver full stop not just a road racer im just really excited that ive been given an opportunity and ive able to be making the most of it you know you dont get many chances in life to do something special like this and today im going to look back at very fondly the whole weekend to be honest with you im just really proud of both my times and i hope it can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2890992 im going to have to go back and look at it i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to stay in the top 35 in owner points and try to get back into the top 35 thats what we needed to do with our champion mortgage toyota its unfortunate and im sorry for the fans and all the cars that got wrecked there and then they had to wait through that red flag i was just racing hard and really it doesnt look much different than how it was with kyle busch and jeff burton yesterday but im sure theyll make a big deal out of it
2890993 we were held up in a little traffic and we were racing for position toward the end and he got beside me i gave him room on the outside but he didnt give me any room coming back to the left i was already in the dirt but i wasnt trying to bounce off of him that was the only choice i had then he got his feathers all ruffled up and decided he wanted to play at that point i just let him go we just didnt have a great car and thats just how it goes
2890994 i didnt think it was possible with 10 laps to go to tell you the truth i knew erik darnell was going to be tough i had a really hard time passing the 30 bodine he was running strong too then i saw bodine sliding around and i was able to get by him i worked on darnell and was able to get to victory lane
2890995 we were out of tires at the end i was doing my best to keep johnny benson back there and held him off for a while as soon as he cleared bodine he ran right up there once benson got air on the nose that was it i held him off for a while but he got under me and that was it
2890996 grandma youve worked your fingers to the bone you deserve this
2890997 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2890998 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
2890999 three muscular men wearing caps and jeans sprinted towards us
2891000 the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last 50 years
2891001 it used to hold my gps but i leave it at home now
2891002 its the crime x they are too easy to steal
2891003 since the surveillance cameras came in we have seen a very dramatic decrease in crime in shenzhen
2891004 the central government eventually wants to have city by city surveillance so they could just sit and monitor one city and its surveillance system as a whole
2891005 its all part of that bigger project once the tests are done and its proven they will be spreading from the big province to the cities even to the rural farmland
2891006 the local people want to make money from migrant workers but they dont want to give them rights but why are the local people so rich because of the migrant workers
2891007 severely battle any creation or any spreading of rumors that would upset or frighten people or cause social disorder or illegal criminal behavior that could damage social stability
2891008 we have to be able to match a face in a 10 million database in one second
2891009 if we pass if we come out number one we are guaranteed a market in china
2891010 every time the text message comes i know my daughter is spending money
2891011 honestly the technology so far still cant meet their needs
2891012 the photos that they show us were just too blurry
2891013 if youre a political organizer they want to know your motive
2891014 so they take the picture give the photo so at least they can find out who that person is
2891015 i made the first phone call and sent the first e mail
2891016 well be involved on behalf of l 1 in china
2891017 out the window you can see the statue of liberty
2891018 it seemed that they were more excited than us when we tell them the results
2891019 nothing absolutely nothing we are uninvolved we really dont have any relationships at all
2891020 absolutely weve sold testing sdks software development kits to pixel solutions and to others in china that may be entering a test
2891021 was to keep u s companies out of the business of helping the chinese police conduct their business which might ultimately end up as it did in 1989 in the suppression of human rights and democracy in china
2891022 they are exported from the u s or are the foreign direct product of a u s origin item
2891023 i really dont want to comment so there is no comment
2891024 catch the political criminals you know the dissidents more easily
2891025 the internet in china a tool for freedom or suppression
2891026 set up an elaborate computer monitoring system to analyze feeds from indoor and outdoor cameras in one of beijings most populated districts
2891027 thousands of video cameras simultaneously and automatically alerts them to suspicious or fast moving objects like people running
2891028 2 000 camera network in a single large neighborhood the first step toward a citywide network of 250 000 cameras to be installed before the asian games in 2010
2891029 were at the start of a massive boom in chinese security spending
2891030 and just as we need to be aware of how to profit from the growth in chinas commodity consumption we need to be aware of companies that will profit from security consumption theres big money to be made
2891031 we are going public at the end of this year on the nasdaq
2891032 if you walk out of this building you will be under surveillance in five to six different ways
2891033 if you are a law abiding citizen you shouldnt be afraid
2891034 the criminals are the only ones who should be afraid
2891035 chinas golden shield corporations and the development of surveillance technology in the peoples republic of china
2891036 a gigantic online database with an all encompassing surveillance network x incorporating speech and face recognition closed circuit television smart cards credit records and internet surveillance technologies
2891037 we thought this information was going to shock the world
2891038 it was clearly similar to what we were condemning china for
2891039 it is clear that any countrys legal authorities closely monitor the spread of illegal information
2891040 we have noted that the u s is doing a good job on this front
2891041 there are two words that i hear in response again and again guant namo bay
2891042 i can guarantee you that there are people in the bush administration who are studying the use of surveillance technologies being developed here and have at least skeletal plans to implement them at home
2891043 we can already see it in new york with cctv cameras once you have the cameras in place you have the infrastructure for a powerful tracking system im worried about what this will mean if the u s government goes totalitarian and starts employing these technologies more than they are already im worried about the threat this poses to american democracy
2891044 would do what they are doing here in a heartbeat if he could
2891045 we not only know who you are we also know where you are
2891046 you should really send someone to shenzhen to do this story
2891047 theres a journalist that i think can help us will you show her around the factory tomorrow
2891048 do you think this technology can eliminate dissent in china eliminate activism in china
2891049 no theres just too much of it what it can do is make life for people like me impossible but thats because im high profile and they already know me and theyre already looking for me
2891050 we would love to pay our workers more and treat them better
2891051 this is just the way things are done in china
2891052 yes these network surveillance cameras that companies like ge and honeywell are selling in beijing are going to stay after the olympics and they will be used for domestic purposes
2891053 artificial intelligence to extend and improve the existing monitoring system
2891054 we aim to achieve all day and all weather monitoring capability
2891055 all visitors should be aware that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
2891056 are considered to be subject to on site or remote technical monitoring at all times hotel rooms residences and offices may be accessed at any time without the occupants consent or knowledge
2891057 this seems to suggest an effort by the police or other security forces to eavesdrop on conversations of passengers rather than for the immediate safety and security of the taxi driver
2891058 i wouldnt want to take a photo of my passengers without their knowledge
2891059 generally speaking chinese strengths really lie in pre empting threats rather than in crisis management or emergency response in the event that there really are any incidents
2891060 china is trying to project a picture and a narrative about the olympics
2891061 by limiting journalists shutting down the internet arresting activists its hoping to control the message
2891062 everyone feels theyre entering a police state which by the way it is duh
2891063 so theyve got people reporting down to the lowest neighborhood level which is not new overlaid by state of the art technology its the best of the old and the new
2891064 if we see any suspicious people we call the police and report on them
2891065 we are happy to help protect our motherland assist the nation and help our leaders relax
2891066 its getting better in china but we still have a ways to go
2891067 all hotel rooms and offices are considered to be subject to on site or remote technical monitoring at all times
2891068 but with surveillance technologies youre getting into the fabric of the state
2891069 you could say that we are a police state but the fact is were dreadfully inefficient
2891070 if we prosecuted all the adulterers we wouldnt have time for the counter revolutionaries
2891071 few men of our time have achieved as penetrating an insight into sensuality as henry miller best known for the notoriously rabelaisian chronicles of his life tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn these books are only available in america under the counter although recognized in europe as ranking among the true masterpieces of modern literature
2891072 the greek woman even when she is cultured is first and foremost a woman sic she sheds a distinct fragrance she warms and thrills you
2891073 he hopes she would accept his and with a final glance at the mirror he straightened his and then went whistling out the door
2891074 a naughty vocabulary a wild imagination and a large talent
2891075 perdido toda esperanza tras una serie de fracasos en su vida y volvi su ira contra la sociedad
2891076 todas sus esperanzas reposaban en su hijo de 21 a os
2891077 that way it feels more like a community and less like a hotel
2891078 we tried to give something positive to everyone who was interested in the project
2891079 its to our benefit to make sure the community is happy with what were providing
2891080 we had no outdoor space before except for the front porch
2891081 its so nice for them to have this yard its just a taste of home
2891082 serious human rights violations persecution of minorities and total disregard of religious freedom practiced in direct contravention of international human rights norms and treaties by the bjp bharatiya janata party government in gujarat
2891083 modi and his administration closed the files on over 2 000 police cases where the victims filed reports of rapes killings and destruction of their property
2891084 the role of chief minister narendra modi and his government in promoting attitudes of racial supremacy racial hatred and the legacy of nazism through his governments support of school textbooks in which nazism is condoned
2891085 without formulating the domicile policy the government is conducting the teachers examination this way the local people will suffer and outsiders will get jobs in the state
2891086 we have decided that until all oustees get residential and agricultural areas of their choice they will not vacate their villages
2891087 for quenching the thirst of delhiites the government is hell bent upon taking away our livelihood
2891088 we would prefer a watery grave to surrendering to the government our land that has been tilled by our forefathers
2891089 every affected family must get at least 10 bighas of agriculture land at the new settlement and the compensation should be decided by taking us into confidence
2891090 i thoroughly enjoyed my fish and chips served by the half naked man
2891091 the care of our clients is our number one priority and fundamental to this is giving them choices and respecting their wishes as adults
2891092 our police forces and agencies do not have the efficiency nor the protocol to fight terrorism crimes against women and children
2891093 especially in cases of terrorism which has no state or country and no religion
2891094 we need a federal police system with power to investigate and file charges
2891095 in independent india mass crimes have been committed including communal violence attacks against dalits and adivasis as well as sexual violence torture enforced disappearance and extra judicial killings that are conducted in a widespread or systematic manner
2891096 civilians including women children and minorities have often been victims of these crimes despite the guarantee of fundamental rights in the indian constitution as well as an elaborate set of criminal laws it is an undeniable fact that a large scale impunity exists for many such crimes
2891097 that could be useful for civil society in india to strengthen the domestic legal system through law reform initiatives including provisions on reparations to and protection of victims
2891098 there is no written procedure followed for examining petitions under article 72 of the constitution dealing with the presidents power to grant pardon or to suspend remit and commute death sentences to a condemned prisoner which could be provided to the appellant
2891099 the procedure for examining mercy petitions by the ministry of home affairs for sending recommendations to the president without delays is of official importance
2891100 involves maintaining a fine balance between an individuals life on the one hand and the imperative need to award appropriate punishment for heinous crimes considering the societys sensitivities towards such crimes on the other
2891101 anything to try and cut the cost of running your car is worth it
2891102 vintage whisky seems to work best on older cars i put nothing but the best in mine
2891103 we are known as whisky island with seven working distilleries
2891104 if our idea can be refined properly we could have everyone here running cars on it
2891105 i must admit i had my doubts but it actually works
2891106 we know whisky makes cars go the question now is will we be allowed to distil our own and instead of drinking it just pour it into our vehicles
2891107 it s all about cost but with the way things are going whisky may end up being cheaper than petrol
2891108 islay gives a lot to the exchequer every year and we get very little back in return surely the chancellor could grant us some leeway to develop whisky fuel
2891109 as the olympics open in beijing it is believed that zeng was taken away to ensure that no journalists will have access to her and that she will be unable to speak out about hu jia during the games
2891110 were hungry we spent three days in a bunker with no lights no gas no water
2891111 i thought they might be with them if theyre still alive
2891112 our husbands are not being let out even the old men theyre all dying fighting
2891113 but theyve also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave
2891114 the stores are either on fire or empty were heading back tonight but we dont know if we can get through
2891115 now people cant get out from tskhinvali even by foot
2891116 we will never forget this there are no words for what we lived
2891117 that such things could happen in the year 2008 i never thought was possible
2891118 espero que el meu or obri la porta a molts m s per a lesport espanyol

2891120 hvor han tar et oppgj r med det som skjer rundt terje t han har mange gode poeng ikke minst rundt dette med anonyme person angrep i form av leserinnlegg i avisa et annet innlegg anonymt omhandler trafikksituasjonen rundt kryssing av rv 120 p flateby med tittelen
2891121 the bottom line is texas is not producing a sufficient number of primary care providers and were going to have to do something to change that or to attract primary care providers into areas that dont have enough
2891122 what thats going to take in texas is some type of loan repayment program coupled with some incentives for graduate medical education coupled with some changes in medical school curricula
2891123 recruiting is so competitive right now the new graduates can pick and choose where they want to go
2891124 were not getting along real well with the gas prices
2891125 when we left michigan it was 2 50 a gallon
2891126 we have many long term and monthly clients especially in the form of workers
2891127 camper single nights are up from last year but are mostly from people within a 100 mile radius
2891128 people cant afford the long trips so theyre taking closer shorter and more frequent trips
2891129 we refocused our business to the smaller more lightweight designs
2891130 what was once our secondary market has become our primary seller
2891131 ive seen a lot of people who are buying and fixing up older ones getting rid of big trailers
2891132 i expected to watch things during the ride along not be in the thick of it
2891133 shes thrashing around as were trying to grab at her clothes through the fence
2891134 she was wearing shorts sandals and a tank top i had my finger twisted in her shirt strap it was getting pretty painful
2891135 you get older you just cant do time like you did
2891136 she said this is a better opportunity to show who you really are
2891137 he told me im willing to give whatever it takes to help you but youve got to put your best into it
2891138 you can either continue to be part of the problem or be part of the solution
2891139 my struggle with drug court and other types of specialty courts is i continue to feel these are major societal problems that society refuses to deal with
2891140 if drug courts were filled with more white men than black men then i think society could see it more as a health epidemic than a crime problem
2891141 we need to recognize this for what it is this is a public health issue
2891142 society needs to deal with it in a very different manner
2891143 its great for those 13 people but as a system is it really working
2891144 if you ask me if it is working im going to tell you yes because i see people succeeding
2891145 it really is going to boil down to how people define success
2891146 its kind of like ice cream except just the ice and its on a stick
2891147 if she wants it fine and if she doesnt want it thats fine too
2891148 he left his wife for another woman but now hes back im nosy so i know things
2891149 they have a son and theyve done a good job with him
2891150 he comes by to make his pickup the same time every night
2891151 one guy came along the other night and i told him no offense but you look like a rottweiler
2891152 it used to be a dump site before they built the post office
2891153 you never know who youre going to see or what youre going to see
2891154 will you pour me a coke and maybe make me a sandwich you do it so much better
2891155 he had this fabulous smile and a great twinkle in his eyes
2891156 the first thought that went through my mind when i met him was uh oh stay away from that one
2891157 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
2891158 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
2891159 when you care for someone with anything like this you have to be on such an intimate level that a lot of people cant handle it and walk away with the care that i give him your guard has to be totally down and you have to be totally open all i know is i cant imagine being with anyone else and feeling as strong for them as i do for this man
2891160 there are a lot of disabled people in this boat who love each other and want to be together
2891161 as long as were ok with god we dont care what the government thinks
2891162 he just has this personality that completely shines through everything
2891163 when people tried to talk me out of this i had a simple answer
2891164 were hoping that his probation officer will advise him to stay with us if hes linked with drugs on his weekend visit he will lose the right to come out early
2891165 were never gonna survive unless we get a little shippy
2891166 all scenes and clips that include ben stillers portrayal of simple jack from the movie dvd trailers promotional material and merchandising
2891167 the movement needs to enter the public eye and not just be talking among ourselves
2891168 a particular sore point has been the films repeated use of the term retard in referring to a character simple jack who is played by mr stiller in a subplot about an actor who chases an oscar by portraying a mindless dolt
2891169 the movies humor was aimed not at the disabled but at the foolishness of actors who will go to any length in advancing their careers
2891170 mr shriver said that he had also begun to ask members of congress for a resolution condemning what he called the movies hate speech and calling for stronger federal support of the intellectually disabled

2891173 the medium is the message outlook for magazine publishing in the digital age
2891174 we all had powerpc code that got rewritten and its not that hard its just time consuming rogue amoeba has six people and we managed to port from one platform to another adobe has almost 6 000 people and they cant pull it off
2891175 developers of new software started after the intel announcement at wwdc 2005 already know the deal use xcode and don t make assumptions about the underlying processor architecture the way apple has set things up with xcode once you re compiling a universal binary it s not that much more work to keep producing universal binaries than it would be to produce binaries for a single architecture
2891176 if soundbooth is written entirely in standard c or c and they re using gcc no extra writing is necessary the same c code can be compiled for both architectures those are two big ifs though
2891177 designed from the ground up to deliver high quality sound to web and video workflows
2891178 by porting a previously pc only piece of software to the mactels is doing all mac users a favor because it strengthens apples media production options
2891179 i just dont think were in a position to know whether these were right policies or wrong policies yet
2891180 but if adobe after researching the matter carefully chooses to save itself an unspecified amount of time and expense by not porting a new version of an existing program to a platform that it was never designed for this is not betrayal arrogance or stupidity
2891181 for example none of the adobe statements seemed to me to be arrogant but you obviously feel differently
2891182 mac users should be happy because adobe brought this software to the mac platform and that alone was enough
2891183 and for that matter why cant a jet turbine be made as quickly and cheaply as a two stroke weed eater
2891184 who needs a top 10 when youve got a top 6 ok so we only had 6 students in total but regardless the graduation night was a great chance for students and lecturers to reflect on the long hours and the hard yards that have been put in over the past months award school hobart has again produced a group who have absorbed learned and created ideas and thats what award school is all about
2891185 for women to increase fertility and for men to increase sexual desire
2891186 derived from the egyptian word for january which was when chicory was harvested and eaten many thousands of years ago in egypt
2891187 folklore reports from afghanistan before the wars described the use of aqueous root extracts of cichorium intybus l as a light sensitive plant remedy for malaria
2891188 american indians used the crushed leaves on insect bites and the root was chewed to allay fear at night
2891189 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2891190 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2891191 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2891192 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2891193 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
2891194 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party
2891195 many of these calls we are getting are from people who have finally reached a point where they want to change their lives
2891196 this program has been the difference between life and death for me
2891197 i really dont know if i would be clean today if i didnt have this help
2891198 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2891199 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2891200 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2891201 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2891202 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2891203 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2891204 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is
2891205 if the person is not thats viewed as a personal affront to clinton ive heard that repeatedly
2891206 i hope that in the next three months those folks will have an awakening in terms of whats at stake in november
2891207 weve really been working on building our partnership with the elgin symphony for the past few years this is just a magnificent opportunity
2891208 this is probably the biggest name weve gotten in town not only to perform with the orchestra but with students in the area as well
2891209 we have a phenomenal location with great visibility off i 90
2891210 we ran into a problem with a florida hotel over the name
2891211 those decisions and planning are always in a constant state of flux
2891212 my major goal was to finish this race without reinjuring my left calf muscle and i did
2891213 when youve got to operate an event like this weather really rules the day
2891214 the triathlon is a new hip sport and more people are coming into it
2891215 the run was my favorite because i got to be by myself and think
2891216 just because of the experience of doing it and knowing you can accomplish something that you set out to do
2891217 it was a nice ride and i thought it was paced well
2891218 were gonna get something good to eat and relax a little bit
2891219 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2891220 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2891221 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2891222 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2891223 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2891224 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2891225 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2891226 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2891227 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2891228 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2891229 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2891230 the goal is to make sure theres not another family that will go through what we went through
2891231 thats a lot more manpower they can cover a lot of territory
2891232 the way the game is played it puts it closer to election time
2891233 i want to make a statement i want a lot of family members there i want a lot of signatures
2891234 obviously the more money you bring in the more you can do
2891235 gannon and duarte are not ones to stay in five star hotels and eat in five star restaurants they want to stretch the money as far as they can go
2891236 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2891237 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2891238 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2891239 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2891240 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2891241 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2891242 without a budget signed by the governor no funding can be released at all
2891243 so not only do we have this permanent loss of funds but currently we are not even getting funds that were allocated
2891244 i know that mchenry county will come through for us again
2891245 we are determined to close this budget gap and not allow our programs to be eliminated
2891246 the corps had a spectacular performance and drew multiple standing ovations
2891247 the kids felt very good about themselves and thats what its all about
2891248 ill have to admit that any one of the top four corps could have won
2891249 we hope to make it interesting intellectual and very emotional
2891250 were glad theyre going to be able to take it up and carry it forward it kind of lets us believe the people there are reasonable and willing to accept the cooperation of the county and village to solve a mutual problem
2891251 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2891252 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2891253 its giving them municipalities the ability to raise taxes without taking the grief
2891254 initial eav and current eav can be applied to a single parcel or property within a tif redevelopment area or an aggregate of all property within the tif or a combination of the two
2891255 the biggest concern that we have is that we are no longer talking to airplanes
2891256 we can do without radar in an emergency but we need to talk to airplanes
2891257 they said when they fixed it the last time it was caused by computer card problem
2891258 any system that run 24 7 occasionally theres going to be an outage
2891259 outages are very very rare and were very adept at handling them
2891260 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2891261 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2891262 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2891263 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2891264 you told me more about the process than i know
2891265 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2891266 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2891267 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2891268 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2891269 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2891270 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2891271 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2891272 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2891273 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2891274 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2891275 this is agent busyd to beijing central command i need to speak to the minister of popular culture
2891276 random thoughts and link roundup early adopters and twitter edition
2891277 guest post is up at building camelot bringing home a second baby
2891278 if you like madonna youre gay i listen to motley crue
2891279 for each hamburger that originated from animals raised on rainforest land approximately 55 square feet of forest have been destroyed
2891280 an eye for an eye only ends up making the world blind
2891281 no he doesnt complain but we were sure to get him neutered
2891282 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2891283 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
2891284 be always drunken nothing else matters that is the only question if you would not feel the horrible burden of time weighing on your shoulders and crushing you to the earth be drunken continually drunken with what with wine with poetry or with virtue as you will but be drunken and if sometimes on the stairs of a palace or on the green side of a ditch or in the dreary solitude of your own room you should awaken and the drunkenness be half or wholly slipped away from you ask of the wind or of the wave or of the star or of the bird or of the clock of whatever flies or sighs or rocks or sings or speaks ask what hour it is and the wind wave star bird clock will answer you it is the hour to be drunken be drunken if you would not be martyred slaves of time be drunken continually with wine with poetry or with virtue as you will
2891285 schon mal einige zehntausend dieser hebr er unter giftgas h tte setzen sollen
2891286 dont cry you know i love you and never ment to hurt you my little princess
2891287 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2891288 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2891289 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2891290 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2891291 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2891292 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2891293 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2891294 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2891295 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2891296 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2891297 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2891298 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2891299 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2891300 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2891301 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2891302 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2891303 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2891304 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2891305 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2891306 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2891307 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2891308 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2891309 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2891310 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2891311 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2891312 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2891313 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2891314 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2891315 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2891316 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2891317 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2891318 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2891319 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2891320 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2891321 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2891322 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2891323 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2891324 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2891325 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2891326 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2891327 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2891328 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2891329 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2891330 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2891331 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2891332 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2891333 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2891334 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2891335 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2891336 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2891337 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2891338 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2891339 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2891340 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2891341 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2891342 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2891343 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2891344 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2891345 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2891346 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2891347 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2891348 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2891349 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2891350 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2891351 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2891352 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2891353 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2891354 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2891355 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2891356 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2891357 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2891358 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2891359 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2891360 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2891361 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2891362 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2891363 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2891364 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2891365 who are open to doing something on the production side
2891366 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2891367 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2891368 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2891369 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

2891491 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility to win or lose in a major
2891492 you know the good thing about it is i feel good out there i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
2891493 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2891494 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2891495 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out

2891520 being at ub university of botswana does not mean i stop being a zimbabwean supporting zanu pf has no bearing on my qualifications as a journalist or competence as a media practitioner
2891521 they need only look at the university of zimbabwe today whose chancellor is president mugabe but which employs vocal mdc office holders sympathizers and activists like dr lovemore madhuku dr john makumbe and eliphas mukonoweshuro among others
2891522 when a country has more goats than people it suffers a serious leadership deficiency as is happening in botswana where a primitive and intolerant military junta is masquerading as a democracy
2891523 being at ub university of botswana does not mean i stop being a zimbabwean supporting zanu pf has no bearing on my qualifications as a journalist or competence as a media practitioner
2891524 they need only look at the university of zimbabwe today whose chancellor is president mugabe but which employs vocal mdc office holders sympathizers and activists like dr lovemore madhuku dr john makumbe and eliphas mukonoweshuro among others

2891526 news palestinian poet mahmoud darwish in an undated file photo
2891527 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2891528 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2891529 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2891530 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2891531 i am not taking anything from beyond the 4 gospels as reliable because i do not trust anyone beyond the apostles to have understood a lick of christs teachings
2891532 jesus is one path to god because jesus is one messenger of god among many including abraham and the other prophets and whoever else i forget my pantheism jesus isnt literally the only path to god but his teachings the golden rule centrally advocated by like every prophet in every religion everywhere are the only way to godliness
2891533 enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and few are those who find it
2891534 this is my beloved son with whom i am well pleased god didnt say listen to moses or elijah or the other prophets and scribes but listen to him only jesus
2891535 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but
2891536 if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our abode with him john 14 23 and
2891537 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
2891538 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2891539 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
2891540 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas
2891541 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2891542 you dont make fishing rods according to the fishes needs do you
2891543 add more stuff thats difficult to digest by babies little tummies
2891544 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2891545 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2891546 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2891547 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2891548 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2891549 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2891550 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2891551 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2891552 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2891553 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2891554 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2891555 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2891556 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2891557 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2891558 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2891559 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2891560 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2891561 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2891562 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2891563 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2891564 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2891565 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2891566 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2891567 the answer is yes and were working on that right now
2891568 we need to put together a streak and hopefully we can go to minnesota and win that series
2891569 weve got to come out fighting and play with a lot of urgency
2891570 the easiest way to describe that game was we gave it away
2891571 we would love you to be part of our miracle
2891572 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
2891573 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2891574 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2891575 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2891576 jag bara stakar mig och v ljer l jliga ord
2891577 and how are they moving along on the path to healing
2891578 sometimes monastic officials wanted a child from a powerful local noble family to give the cloister more political clout other times they wanted a child from a lower class family who would have little leverage to influence the childs upbringing
2891579 a local warlord the chinese emperor or even the dalai lamas government in lhasa might have tried to impose its choice of tulku on a monastery for political reasons
2891580 idea of contextualization is to frame the gospel message in language and communication forms appropriate and meaningful to the local culture and to focus the message upon crucial issues in the lives of people
2891581 the process of learning to express genuine christianity in socioculturally appropriate ways
2891582 the concept indigenization was broadened into contextualization which suggests a far more comprehensive and profound process of accommodating the gospel to the total life of a people
2891583 that discipline which deals with the essential nature of the gospel its cross cultural communication and the development and fostering of local theologies and indigenous church forms
2891584 has to do with how the gospel revealed in scripture authentically comes to life in each new cultural societal religious and historical setting
2891585 that god is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent
2891586 any right to impose in the name of christ upon one group of christians a set of assumptions about life determined by another time and place
2891587 universalizing factor bringing christians of all cultures and ages together through a common inheritance lest any of us make the christian faith such a place to feel at home that no one else can live there

2891591 you chose many of the same answers that earth sign like miranda the cynical but pragmatic lawyer might have chosen just like mirandas had a tough time deciding whether to give in to the affections of steve the bartender you dont give your heart up to just anyone miranda shies away from a relationship with steve because hes just a bartender not something more conventionally ambitious or stable those with powerful earth sign qualities characteristics associated with taurus virgo and capricorn are cautious in love and seek stability and status over nearly anything else earth signs provide a steady realistic attitude and they can bring order out of chaos a little known earth sign fact incredibly sensual you seethe beneath that smart expensive business suit of yours yearning for intimacy but hesitant to give up your material needs your career ambitions or your responsibilities for a passionate moment that might not turn out the way youd hope

2891601 getting help from your parents and others isnt basically cheating i know this is all a big thing but you need at least someone who has experience to proofread it i have a step uncle and aunt who finished college and right now are giving advice and support its not cheating cheating is where your experienced family members or friends write your college essay then you can say alright thats cheating but im not pressuring you to do all this you can do which way its best for you
2891602 i definitely think that this is a big thing and you shouldnt do it you should write your own essay and maybe have your sister proofread it therefore you are not cheating its safe and she can still help you out
2891603 to be quite honest i think that you are doing yourself a disservice if you allow someone else to write or completely revamp your college essay colleges require you to write the essay so that they can see how you are able to write on the other hand if your sister edits your paper and pushes you in the right direction thats a different story as long as all of the ideas and the core structure is yours you would be crazy not to have someone who knows you in some way read your essay to make sure it sounds like your voice writing it just make sure that its still your essay in the end your question lies in a gray area is it cheating or not if you feel it is definitely dont do it
2891604 well im not good at jokes but my friend is and he always remembers jokes by writing them on his hand or a small piece of paper or just repeating it over and over again repeating stuff over and over again was my technique since i use that to remember sat words well try one of them
2891605 i usually only remember jokes if they are extremely funny so maybe you can look up jokes and the ones that really get you laughing are most likely going to be the ones that you will remember or like cherie said you should try writing them on flashcards just remember the main part of the joke and maybe you can improvise on the little parts good luck
2891606 i can never remember jokes im the worst with them what i do is try to remember a few at a time its always harder if you try and remember every joke you hear i have written jokes down before that i have found funny its ok to do i dont think i have ever gone back to any but the process of writing stuff down in the first place helps me remember things
2891607 life after college what your parents and professors never taught you
2891608 the book is about what i think someone in their 20s would need to know
2891609 you are potentially a different person than you were when you were in high school
2891610 you have to talk about all that before you move home
2891611 its crazy you just got in the race and already you have to prepare for the finish
2891612 it is one thing to be prepared to be fully engaged adults but it is quite another thing to fully experience it

2891625 on behalf of its members bio commends the actions taken by codex this week these standards represent codexs commitment to promoting food safety for consumers while embracing scientific advances and fostering trade of biotech derived agriculture products
2891626 bio and its members applaud the u s government and other governments around the world for moving these science based guidelines to adoption by codex
2891627 adoption of guidance related to food safety assessments of low level presence is essential to facilitate international trade while regulating incidental or trace amounts of biotechnology events in food and feed products
2891628 adoption of the guidelines for risk assessment of the safety of foods derived from genetically engineered ge animals represents a policy breakthrough in the area of animal biotechnology
2891629 approval of the guidelines can now pave the way for the united states and other countries to develop science based regulatory processes to govern the use of ge animals
2891630 the codex approved texts on plant and animal biotechnology serve as science based guidance which will further enhance consumer safety and health while promoting the trade of biotech derived products this represents a tremendous step forward for farmers traders and biotechnology industries in the united states and around the world
2891631 whether a single event or a coordinated event whether intentional or accidental it is simply a matter of time before a catastrophic network event happens and when it happens think of it as a kind of i9 11 event but the bad guys are not al qaeda will we be prepared for the inevitable ipatriot act response are we better prepared than civil libertarians were when we were hit with the usa patriot act have we even framed the right debate
2891632 developers should assume that the environment in which their system resides is insecure
2891633 attackers are more likely to attack a weak spot in a software system than to penetrate a heavily fortified component for example some cryptographic algorithms can take many years to break so attackers are not likely to attack encrypted information communicated in a network instead the endpoints of communication e g servers may be much easier to attack
2891634 this is completely unacceptable especially from lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2891635 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2891636 i have extensive experience handling the same complicated business transactions that a circuit judge sees on a regular basis in circuit civil court family law court and probate court
2891637 any judge assigned to a division of the circuit court that he does not practice in will have to do some work lawyers are trained to learn study and research the type of law i practice is complicated criminal law is not so complicated its very procedural
2891638 immediately informs the parties how his courtroom will be conducted and so it is
2891639 we had hoped for more financial support but with economics in the state of florida what it is that did not come through

2891650 we feel pretty strongly that a lot of the seats are being rented by the democrats and theyll be giving them back

2891652 we have every reason to believe thats going to bode well for us this year
2891653 why arent the ds doing better in florida when theyre picking up seats nationally its reapportionment
2891654 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector
2891655 not only will you see panels on the roofs of your local stores but i suspect very soon retailers will have stickers in their windows saying this is a green energy store
2891656 we want to keep pushing as many as we possibly can
2891657 were looking into a 600 000 dollar budget deficit for this year

2891661 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2891662 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2891663 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2891664 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2891665 where our treasures are there will our heart be also
2891666 the slowdown in china is an undeniable fact but we think the worries are a bit overdone we expect the olympic games to have small negative impact on production and demand in the july september quarter and we see a rebound post the olympics on pent up demand
2891667 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2891668 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2891669 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2891670 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2891671 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2891672 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2891673 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2891674 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2891675 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2891676 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2891677 the freedom to travel anonymously is fundamentally important to our right to peaceably assemble

2891687 the whole which christ had in view was to reinstate and restore to its primitive integrity the wisdom of the ancients to reduce within bounds the universally prevailing dominion of superstition and to exterminate the various errors that had found their way into the different popular religions

2891743 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2891744 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2891745 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2891746 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day

2891759 hai para pemuda barangsiapa di antara kamu sudah ada kemampuan maka kawinlah sebab dia itu dapat menundukkan pandangan dan memelihara kemaluan tetapi barangsiapa tidak mampu maka hendaknya ia berpuasa sebab puasa itu baginya merupakan pelindung
2891760 the hispanic population is growing faster in much of the south than anywhere else in the united states across a broad swath of the region stretching westward from north carolina on the atlantic seaboard to arkansas across the mississippi river and south to alabama on the gulf of mexico sizeable hispanic populations have emerged suddenly in communities where latinos were a sparse presence just a decade or two ago
2891761 if this situation goes on like this people will leave because they see doors closing for them
2891762 if it goes on i will have to move somewhere else too maybe even my own country
2891763 we dont want more war and we want the economy to get better with mccain it would be the same story as with bush
2891764 were concerned that its implementation in nearby regions is going to influence other counties
2891765 is that unfortunately the percentage of those in the general population who actually vote is small those of us who worry about these issues do not go to the polling booths to try to oust these people from office
2891766 people feel comfortable and do go out to exercise their rights were a very conformist people i have documents and my family is ok then let the others be damned
2891767 we havent seen clearly what their policies on immigration and education will be they talk a lot about the war and whats going on with energy
2891768 la magnificence des jo contraste avec la terreur au tibet
2891769 netrino institute s courses have been designed to provide engineers with concrete strategies and tactics to increase the quality of the embedded software that they develop and on which society increasingly depends
2891770 netrino institute aims to give embedded software engineers who attend our courses an improved set of specific tools and methods that can be applied immediately on their design teams to improve software quality
2891771 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2891772 i couldnt believe that i actually felt better not fantastic but better
2891773 and i wanted to know why and i wanted to help others
2891774 someone said to me why are you sitting through all this testimony and i said i dont want to be surprised by anything in traumatic grief thats when your stomach does a flip when you get an intense headache and when you want to go to bed for three days
2891775 well there is no law that says i have to but thats my son aaron whos going to stand for him
2891776 ive gone back and forth in my mind on the death penalty
2891777 if i were the state could i give a lethal injection
2891778 probably not if i had the chance to stop what happened any mother would rip the face off that person but can i do it after the fact im not sure
2891779 weve ramped up the enforcement efforts were going to continue to do so
2891780 everything we do is the result of a lengthy investigation
2891781 until then were going to do what we do in a safe and professional manner
2891782 specific measures actually offer remarkably small incentives with complicated features that most homeowners or potential homeowners will likely choose to forgo
2891783 its a no interest loan for 15 years that saves the buyer at most just a few hundred dollars a year the annual value of the forgone interest
2891784 this seems like a very small amount to influence the decision of anxious new buyers waiting on the markets sideline
2891785 as i told the national association of realtors at its washington meeting in may the tax credit is worthless
2891786 buyers need cash up front for a down payment instead
2891787 the term house poor comes from people who spend the majority of their income on a mortgage payment
2891788 these are the same people that end up filing for foreclosure lenders will tell you that you can afford more than 25 percent of your household income but they are the same people that helped the housing market crash
2891789 your goal should be to buy a house you can afford and to pay the mortgage so you can keep it
2891790 wir leben in zeiten hoher energiepreise da f hrt kein weg zur ck
2891791 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2891792 chester county is ground zero in the battle for control of the state house
2891793 not only is pennsylvania the key state in the presidential election but chester county is the key to the keystone state
2891794 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate
2891795 from what im hearing from new democrats the republican party no longer represents their values
2891796 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2891797 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2891798 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2891799 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2891800 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you
2891801 thats why what happens here is a microcosm for what happens nationally
2891802 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2891803 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2891804 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2891805 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2891806 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2891807 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else
2891808 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2891809 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2891810 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2891811 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2891812 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2891813 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2891814 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2891815 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2891816 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2891817 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2891818 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2891819 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2891820 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
2891821 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker
2891822 it was not the reporter who won freedom of the press but the airman
2891823 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2891824 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2891825 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2891826 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2891827 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2891828 obama tried to make us lose in iraq to further his own ambitions
2891829 the pacific has lost a leader who had the region at heart he was a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
2891830 its really important if in a tradition like the ekka that families are able to get there and leave there safely
2891831 so im calling on bcc to ensure that all of its car parks particularly in victoria park that supply parking for families gaining access to the ekka are safe and well lit at night
2891832 here are obvious safety concerns in victoria park at the car parks that have been established for people gaining access to the ekka
2891833 its an amazing experience and ive got absolutely no intention of giving it away
2891834 i dont intend to retire in the next term of government or opposition
2891835 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2891836 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2891837 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2891838 we are seeing the taj mahal this week coupon code fans
2891839 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2891840 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2891841 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2891842 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2891843 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2891844 kami menilai jpu telah menyamakan profesi pilot dengan kegiatan teroris sebagaimana dalam kasus menara wtc di amerika serikat beberapa tahun lalu yang sengaja menggunakan pesawat untuk kejahatan
2891845 profesi pilot merupakan pekerjaan spesial sehingga harus diperlakukan spesial atau lex specialis dan bukan lex generalis selain itu penerangan kuhp dalam dakwaan juga tidak tepat karena ada undang undang no 15 1992 tentang ketentuan pidana yang berhubungan dengan penerbangan
2891846 jpu nampak sekali ragu ragu dalam menerapkan pasal pasal sehingga menggunakan pasal dalam kuhp untuk memaksakan dakwaannya padahal seharusnya menggunakan uu penerbangan dan kode etik profesi pilot
2891847 ini berarti menyamakan kasus kecelakaan ini dengan kasus teroris yang menabrakkan pesawat ke menara wtc di amerika serikat 11 september 2001 lalu
2891848 seharusnya jpu menggunakan pasal 60 dalam uu penerbangan no 15 1992 dan menggunakan asas lex spesialis dan bukan dengan kuhp karena saat kecelakaan pesawat uu tersebut sudah ada
2891849 sebagai seorang pilot tidak sedikit pun saya berniat mencelakakan para penumpang dan sama sekali tidak benar jika itu merupakan kesengajaan
2891850 sebagai pilot saya selalu diuji secara periodik terkait kondisi saya baik fisik maupun keahlian dan saat itu saya dinyatakan layak untu menjalankan pesawat
2891851 saya kehilangan pekerjaan akibat kejadian tersebut dan ini bukan merupakan sesuatu yang saya inginkan karena saya harus menghidupi istri dan dua anak yang masih kecil

2891856 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium
2891857 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
2891858 i will be out of the office for the next few days please contact one of my able bodied and intelligent coworkers if you need assistance
2891859 the last of a line of lasts the pale princess of a palace cracked
2891860 the launch of the national homelessness information clearinghouse will make it much easier for the homelessness sector to work together and share ideas
2891861 sharing research through this new facility will help government researchers service providers and the community to determine if our responses to homelessness are working
2891862 it will also provide links to all levels of government and homelessness organisations websites this will help to strengthen our ability to address the complex and very real problem of homelessness in australia
2891863 many organisations in the sector work in isolation and a single source of information will provide an efficient way to increase their capacity to deliver services to homeless people and to connect with others working in their field
2891864 the clearinghouse website has been designed to cope with large amounts of content and includes files for download in the document library forums events and hundreds of articles and documents covering 150 categories of information
2891865 the site also includes several of the submissions to the federal governments green paper on homelessness
2891866 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2891867 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2891868 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2891869 over the next ten years we are going to need some additional revenue does that come in taxes i dont know
2891870 does it come from economic growth thats the first prize it seems to me
2891871 the point is we have to stop being afraid of talking about how to pay for the things we say we want
2891872 im not going to be like some of my predecessors and say you can have that without paying for it were going to have to make some choices
2891873 i dont buy the conventional politics that says you can never ever mention taxes
2891874 we can deal with the fact that we hate taxes
2891875 people hate to pay taxes but i think they hate broken roads and unplowed streets and failing schools even more
2891876 this is one governor who just doesnt connect the dots i dont think he sees a connection between all the programs he wants and the needed revenues
2891877 he says we shouldnt be afraid about talking about taxes and then he doesnt talk about taxes
2891878 we are trying to turn around a habit of neglect that goes back a long time here in state government
2891879 were not going to be able to do that in a day or in a year but we can start it and thats what i mean to do
2891880 hes determined to crank up spending and borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
2891881 maybe when he worked for texaco and coca cola thats how he did things but most people in massachusetts dont have that kind of money
2891882 we are going to have to make some investments in ourselves in our infrastructure and in our people in order to ensure our long term prosperity
2891883 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2891884 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2891885 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2891886 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2891887 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2891888 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2891889 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2891890 every nickel counts at this point i think its all going into the gas
2891891 the price has come down but more important what im hearing is the supply side to supermarket retailers is better because tourist consumption is down in maine
2891892 ive never seen anything like it where im able to promote lobsters at a reasonable price
2891893 if the economy stays like this its going to put a lot of guys out of business
2891894 theres probably going to be some people fishing this year who arent going to be around next year the guys that have low debt will survive and the ones that have debt wont
2891895 it puts a real strain on your business youre operating at a very slim margin
2891896 so the lobsterman gets squeezed because hes got the cost going up and hes got a product he has to get rid of because if you do raise the price too high it shuts off the markets
2891897 pretty soon restaurants take it off the menu and say call me when it gets more reasonable
2891898 the average family isnt going out for a lobster dinner this summer with the high cost of fuel and everything else
2891899 thats probably the biggest issue facing everybody and we dont have any control over that
2891900 thats the type of food where if you want it youre going to get it
2891901 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2891902 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2891903 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2891904 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2891905 gardening shows them that from dirt and dust what beauty comes and beauty is what they can bring to this world when they leave here
2891906 they worked really hard that soil was hard as a rock we also started in july which isnt really the best time to plant a garden but they were determined
2891907 i wasnt happy about coming out here on the first day it was hot there were bugs my sneakers and hands were dirty i ended up covered in dirt but then i saw what we were accomplishing and i started to like it
2891908 i thought it would be easy just dig a hole and stick it in how hard could that be then i came out and saw how hard it was to dig through the soil
2891909 we decided to call it the garden of change because it symbolizes the change in us
2891910 i refuse to come back here i promise that to myself and my son michael is 5 years old and i will be making parole on august 21 which means that i can be there when he starts kindergarten i have been worried about that since the day i arrived here
2891911 i want to finish my last couple of semesters of college and become a drug counselor when my fiance died i relapsed and didnt finish school i want to stay drug free and help people who have been through what i have been through
2891912 it gives me a place to think if an inmate can get past the fences and barbed wire she can imagine it is a pretty country inn
2891913 the perennials like the lilies will come up next year after my release i hope the next group works as hard as we did
2891914 the reasons for peace can be found in humanities wounds
2891915 one day we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal we seek but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal we must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means
2891916 peace is a daily a weekly a monthly process gradually changing opinions slowly eroding old barriers quietly building new structures
2891917 peace is not a relationship of nations it is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of soul peace is not merely the absence of war it is also a state of mind lasting peace can come only to peaceful people
2891918 if we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other
2891919 its actually a good time to be doing repair work
2891920 new car sales are down by 52 percent because people are holding onto their cars longer and getting them fixed
2891921 we basically ripped the back of the building off and tried to make it more attractive to people in town its a retro theme with the checkerboard floor and the red white and black color scheme we wanted to bring back that comfortable 60s feel where you go into a garage and everyones friendly and it was a good experience
2891922 ever since i was little all i wanted to do is work on cars its what i do best
2891923 ive done some ase national association for automotive service excellence certification classes and had four years of schooling on it and a whole lot of hands on theres nothing like working in the field
2891924 its nice that a hometown boy gets a chance to stay in town and make it work hes taken a building that was in bad shape cleaned it up and added it to the tax base my wife and i are very proud of him and we wish him every success
2891925 the detours are set up so its not really going to interrupt the flow of traffic
2891926 as we did last year we again strongly recommend selectmen appoint a committee to explore revenue growth revenue enhancement options including pay as you throw trash disposal for the town
2891927 this committee should be comprised of at a minimum representatives from any department that generates or has the potential to generate revenue
2891928 we do not expect that this plan will present a rosy picture however we believe that all concerned need to understand the track were on
2891929 a very powerful indicator of a childs educational success is the ability to read at grade level by the third grade
2891930 it makes sense to introduce mentoring to young children who will benefit not only from reading more with an adult but also from having a mentor
2891931 many students need more practice reading and speaking in the english language
2891932 thank you for committing to coming to our school and working with our children
2891933 this literacy based mentoring program couldnt come at a better time
2891934 the new system will help us preserve the collections and the societys archives by controlling the temperature and humidity
2891935 the new air conditioner is something that we need but the big push this year is to do more educational outreach
2891936 whether it be outlaws and cowboys pioneers and indians or ghost towns and saloons we look forward to how the residents transport their homes into the adventurous times of the wild west
2891937 if anyone witnessed the incident or can offer us any additional information please contact the station
2891938 we dont want to discourage anyone from using the bike path but mothers with children should be aware of where they are at all times
2891939 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2891940 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2891941 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2891942 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2891943 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2891944 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2891945 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2891946 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2891947 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2891948 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2891949 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2891950 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2891951 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2891952 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2891953 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2891954 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2891955 there are minutes that are wasted by making a cell phone call and those minutes can mean the difference between stepping off the boat and staying dry or swimming or worse
2891956 i wasnt opposed to a plea deal in any case that resulted in a fair sentence
2891957 a deal was proposed and discussed on and off over an extended period of time with the benefit of hindsight it might have made sense to settle the case
2891958 rejected the notion of a mere 10 years i believe the case could have been settled back in 2006 for around 10 years
2891959 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face
2891960 he will serve his time for the conviction and then he will still be an enemy combatant and as an enemy combatant the process for potential transfer or release will apply
2891961 it demonstrates at the very least that you cannot count on a military jury to throw the book at people
2891962 it doesnt demonstrate the wisdom of the process and it doesnt illustrate the fairness of the process
2891963 they understand chain of command and the relative roles of people and this guy was a nobody
2891964 it is really a question of how a military panel would view a four star generals driver he was a driver this is a decision consistent with their military training and understanding
2891965 if you dont get to go home at the end of the sentence whats the point of the trial
2891966 any legitimacy they might have gained from this case is shot if they dont release him at the end of it hamdan believes that he will be able to go home
2891967 why plea bargain if you think you can go forward and get a few months for material support for terrorism
2891968 we didnt want anything that was going to have rides and carnival atmosphere
2891969 the frog hopping contest is probably the most popular for the kids
2891970 the pope came by and said syl what are you doing here
2891971 i know how to get on the phone and sell tickets
2891972 you learned more about human nature there than at a course at harvard
2891973 i could say i never met anyone i didnt like but thats too often used
2891974 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2891975 this measure will set a marketing code of conduct to help ensure health care providers make choices about prescription drugs and medical devices for their patients based on therapeutic benefits and cost effectiveness
2891976 i applaud the many important initiatives that this legislation enacts to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of health care in the commonwealth
2891977 i have a lot of respect for the governor and i am proud that he did not bend to the pressure
2891978 i have never seen lobbying this intense they have been swarming the statehouse for weeks
2891979 the good news is that there are no more trips to the super bowl no more seminars in warm climates or 100 000 payments to people for ghostwriting pieces they did no work on
2891980 the governor also signed it without sending it back for any amendments if he had amended it since we are no longer in session that would effectively have killed it
2891981 we should be licensing these drug salesmen with all of the drug subsidies it is the taxpayer who ends up paying the most

2891992 we need to do something about it its getting worse
2891993 i really believe this is the tip of the iceberg
2891994 there is no interest in schools or police pretending these things are not happening in the past i have relied on anecdotal evidence but it is good to have some hard evidence of this problem
2891995 these figures show weapon carrying by young people is relatively low in our region and equates to less than one weapon being found in each school every 20 years
2891996 but weapons should not be carried at any time and we are working with schools to make young people aware of this
2891997 the police obviously have these figures they should not really rely on the m e n having to go through foi to release them
2891998 everybody is served well by this information coming out the m e n have done a good service to the community hopefully now head teachers principals and education authorities will take appropriate action
2891999 carrying weapons is becoming acceptable i really believe we need to do something about it

2892010 i think we were 12th we just had a little trouble on the right rear i guess some got two some just got gas we got four because we just got gas the previous time camping world chevrolet was awesome ernie did a great job and everybody at khi thank kevin and delana and chevrolet american commercial lines rvs com and georgia boots i just really really wanted to win that race was mowing them down i just needed like 25 laps i think but you know we finished fourth and well take that and try to build on it
2892011 it feels great like i said all along the trucks are fast we have fast trucks but it seems like something always happens i just want to thank camping world chevrolet american commercial lines rvs com georgia boots all our sponsors its been an up and down type season so far but were always fast you can build on that when we get it all clicked together were going to win a lot of races and i just want to thank everybody at khi for building us great trucks and kevin and delana for having faith in me and this team this is a good race team we just got to get all synced and in order and all be going the same direction were very very close we had a shot at it tonight thats all you can ask for i had a great truck last night i had a great truck tonight just had to pass a little too many trucks there at the end i wish i would have like 15 or 20 more laps but we didnt just proud of the guys that work hard ernie cope crew chief works hard everybody like i said at khi and mark smith pro motors i dont get to talk much so im going to ramble on here a little bit i just want to thank everybody i knew that if things would quit happening we would have great runs we very easily could have won this race tonight we had a shot at it like i said and thats all we can ask for just circumstances we werent there at the end we still had a great run great top five and i just want to thank everybody that supports us
2892012 at the start of the race i thought we were pretty darn good we got up from 14th all the way into the top five i couldnt even tell rick what to do with it one lap it would be tight the next lap it would be loose rick ren made an awesome call thats what this vfw crew is all about when youre down and come out with a top five well take that congratulations to johnny ran an awesome race well go work on those chevrolets weve got to do some more thats three for johnny now three in a row and were going to have to go beat them
2892013 thats why rick stayed out on tires our fastest lap yesterday in practice was with 16 laps on the tires and we figured if we kept the truck freed up we were going to be really good i just couldnt get the balance when i caught them guys i really pushed real bad but other than that ill take a top five you cant complain about that we couldve been worse we were a 20th place truck and came out fifth that says a lot for our team
2892014 our number one goal to night was to just finish this thing and get a top ten thats what we wanted and that was our goal we struggled a little bit at qualifying there we tried some different stuff that didnt quite work for us and it took most of the race to get back to what we knew we should be man they made the right calls there at the end and we were just as good as anybody we came and got four tires and that put us a little bit behind and for some reason i think the motor package we got this year is just a ton tougher to pass here and it made it difficult in traffic well take that we should have had three of these in a row but thats how racing works and the good lord was with us tonight and we got one thanks to everybody back at the shop theyve been working hard and well see if we cant keep improving here
2892015 i think we have a ton of short track momentum the last couple of short tracks weve made huge strides and were making our program better we should have had a top 10 i felt like at orp i had a good solid finish in memphis building block there so were getting better were continuing to learn different things we needed to work on im looking forward to it i like bristol we should have fun

2892088 zum ersten mal bei einem gro ereignis hatte ich das gef hl ich bin wirklich dran das habe ich vorher nie gesp rt und jetzt hatte ich die chance und ich habe sie sofort gen tzt
2892089 und ich habe klar verloren doch dieses mal war es anders
2892090 das ist ein erfolg f r sich etwas einzigartiges davon habe ich immer getr umt
2892091 man muss sich in chancen bringen dass man gewinnen kann ob man den letzten treffer setzt oder nicht da ist dann ein teil gl ck dabei wichtig ist dass man sich selber immer wieder in situationen bringt dass man berhaupt gl ck haben kann dass man knappe gefechte hat und dass man dort hin kommt das ist n mlich arbeit
2892092 logisch ich habe in meiner ersten runde verloren aber in wirklichkeit denke ich dass der wettkampf sehr gut gelaufen ist f r mich ich habe es schon richtig gemacht das ist die lehre die ich daraus ziehen muss ich habe 14 15 verloren aber ich habe mich selber in die situation gebracht gegen einen ebenb rtigen gegner wo ich die chance hatte zu gewinnen wenn ich das wieder schaffe dann denke ich habe ich alles richtig gemacht das war ein starker gegner damals und es wird ein hnlicher gegner diesmal sein
2892093 damals war ich die nummer elf der welt aber em medaille habe ich damals noch keine gehabt
2892094 ich habe sehr gut auf sandplatz gespielt und nun habe ich ein hartplatz turnier gewonnen das bringt viel selbstvertrauen ich hoffe dass ich so weitermachen kann und auch bei den us open gut spiele wenn ich ein top ten spieler werden m chte muss ich sie auf jedem belag schlagen k nnen und das beginne ich jetzt
2892095 ich habe nicht gro artig aufgeschlagen und habe auch nicht so gut returniert wie in der ganzen woche zuvor das hat einen gro en unterschied ausgemacht
2892096 ich habe nicht einmal wirklich viel gespielt das ist ein gutes zeichen dass ich w hrend dieser woche so viel besser geworden bin

2892105 i woke up one day in a lot of pain
2892106 but you have to accept doing half of what you used to do i have a two hour limit before i need to sit or lie down
2892107 i never stopped i didnt realize there was a difference between the energizer bunny and me
2892108 the illness is still not well understood and when people dont see anything unusual about you they question whether youre sick or not
2892109 anybody who has a chronic illness has alterations in biological and psychological mechanisms
2892110 you really cant separate the brain and the body because psychology is biology everything that takes place in the brain is chemical or electrical you cant have the one without the other
2892111 if you ask a person who is depressed what would you do tomorrow if you were better they say i dont know chronic fatigue sufferers will give you a list of 10 things
2892112 most patients will tell you they had a history of being under a lot of work related stress or struggling with anxiety or depression and against that backdrop a second event happened a car accident or a viral infection
2892113 it is my belief that cfs is an opportunistic disease that preys on bodies that are compromised it is an interesting coincidence that i began to feel the symptoms just a moment after that experience of extreme stress
2892114 they have trouble getting back to that old lifestyle and what sets in is depression
2892115 in our modern society for people who have driven themselves fatigue becomes a palatable way out of a difficult existence
2892116 thats what i think happened with me i was a superachiever and a perfectionist i was going to make it no matter what i didnt anticipate the consequences
2892117 whatever caused this impairment is probably not whats keeping it going
2892118 whats keeping it going to a large extent are the misbeliefs about getting back to an active lifestyle
2892119 i had learned to expect complete collapses each time i overextended myself
2892120 as i began to slide into exhaustion i would anticipate how i would soon be unable to sit up and speak and i would become very frightened the anxiety i experienced as i slid into collapse would feed my exhaustion and i would become still weaker
2892121 patients seem to think if their disease is psychiatric it makes them less legitimate it makes their problems less real
2892122 but nobody with any sense blames this on the patients
2892123 if youre wedded to an idea that your illness has a single specific cause your chances of getting better are diminished because youre not addressing parts of the illness that could be prolonging it
2892124 a lot of times they act to inadvertently reinforce illness beliefs such as fear of relapse or exhaustion that are potentially harmful to patients
2892125 if youre feeling negative about everything around you yes youre going to feel worse
2892126 but the opposite is not necessarily true if you improve the state of your mind it doesnt mean youll cure yourself
2892127 i have learned how to replace those fearful thoughts with more positive ones i dont have to collapse this will soon pass
2892128 as a result while i still experience those collapses they are often less severe and briefer than they once were i have been able to live a better happier life
2892129 i was hoping to hear from scientists or physicians who might understand the problem
2892130 thats when i started to realize how big this problem was
2892131 more typically we get a very credible indication of an emerging problem from an official source
2892132 this was driven by lay people and some clinicians who are frustrated and not sure what to do with these folks
2892133 you think youre bringing them evidence but youre really just shooting yourself in the foot
2892134 you have to do due diligence to rule out other causes
2892135 they look like fibers of fabric and on occasion collagen fibers from within the skin in the biopsies i have taken there appear to be only normal skin and inflammation as one would find in a bump that has been picked at
2892136 the conclusion we were left with is that they are unknown fibers not simply contaminants from clothing sticking to scabs
2892137 honestly when he first told me about it i thought theyre all nuts
2892138 there was not one patient i saw who did not look ill
2892139 as a physician i cant imagine reproducing what i saw in that little girls leg
2892140 either theres a co infection people are getting at the same time they get lyme because there are a lot of infections spread by ticks
2892141 they get forgetful they often have a speech hesitation and they often have a hard time telling their story coherently
2892142 but when it progresses it can result in quite extreme paranoia even delusions
2892143 if you send a fiber sample to lab the report will often come back saying textile contaminant
2892144 i said how can you tell and he said im looking at it and thats how its done in every lab across the country
2892145 your average physician does a one month rotation in psychiatry in medical school
2892146 one way to think of it is that theres quite a bit of cross talk between the immune system and the nervous system
2892147 but there isnt a lot of cross talk between psychiatrists and immunologists and infectious disease doctors the way weve compartmentalized specialties contributes to our difficulty in dealing with problems like this
2892148 im not sure how much longer he can push himself
2892149 there are too many symptoms here and hes way too sick for lyme disease
2892150 throwing up in front of his team and a crowd of spectators doesnt fit the profile bulimics purge in private
2892151 doctors can destroy patients by telling them that a true physical disease is all in the head
2892152 to take a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
2892153 at all sort of critical moments when there have been repeated russian provocations randy was a calming influence
2892154 so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2892155 theyre not irreplaceable but its not like we have spare troops lying around somewhere that we can just slot in where the georgians used to be
2892156 okay today were going to play with glitter but its white and sometimes people call it shaving cream
2892157 passages like this make the book her parents recently published about the familys ordeal feel intimate feel like one is sitting with greene in 2002 when she learns there is a 99 percent chance she has leukemia and she futilely clings to the 1 percent chance she does not
2892158 there was nothing wrong with him no physical problems whatsoever
2892159 i really didnt know what to expect going up there
2892160 to get a medal in the olympics im overwhelmed im so pleased
2892161 oil is going to be rationed for sure by the end of my presidency
2892162 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2892163 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2892164 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2892165 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2892166 you told me more about the process than i know
2892167 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2892168 i hate nbc they arent putting the olympics on live that really sucks
2892169 how can you not agree with this hey robert do you have access to cbc ive been liking their coverage
2892170 im watching cbc in canada http www cbc ca olympics do you think it would be any different if another network was covering the olympics in the states

2892190 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2892191 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2892192 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2892193 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2892194 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2892195 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2892196 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2892197 if its what you want christine then thats what well get
2892198 do those girls on the perimeter need to keep prancing like that for the next hour
2892199 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2892200 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation

2892202 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2892203 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2892204 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2892205 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2892206 the launch of humana health assessment in spanish is an important component of humanas initiatives to improve communications to minority members and positively impact access to wellness services
2892207 the ultimate goal is to eliminate any disparity in access to healthcare services so that we help each member pay more attention to their health feel better about their health be more productive and have lower long term health care costs
2892208 there are several contradictions and errors in the statutory declaration that police are concerned about
2892209 we strongly believe that this article is intended solely to skew public perception and to undermine police authority
2892210 de nacht van de beslissing is beter dan duizend maanden
2892211 o allah u bent degene die vergeving schenkt voor zonden u schenkt graag vergeving o allah vergeef mij
2892212 ashadou an la ilaha illallah wa ashadou ana muhammadan rasoulallah
2892213 weet dat het wereldse leven slechts een spel is een vermaak een versiering en opschepperij tussen jullie en wedijver in vermeerdering van bezit en kinderen als de gelijkenis van een regen waarvan de planten die zij voortbrengt bij de boeren verwondering wekt daarna worden ze droog en je ziet ze geel worden en vervolgens worden ze tot vergane resten
2892214 de doodsengel aan wie gij toevertrouwd zijt zal uw ziel nemen dan zult gij tot uw heer worden teruggebracht
2892215 neem een ijzeren staaf met vele uitstekels dring daar mijn buik mee binnen val met elk uitstekel een bloedvat aan en trek hem met die kracht naar buiten
2892216 als een gelovige op het punt staat om te sterven deze wereld achterlatend voor het hiernamaals dalen engelen uit de hemel tot hem neer met heldere gezichten als de zon en wanneer de ongelovige op het punt staat om te sterven deze wereld achterlatend voor het hiernamaals dalen ruwe engelen uit de hemel tot hem neer met duistere gezichten
2892217 ik las het boek van allah geloofde erin en verklaarde dat het waar was
2892218 mijn slaaf heeft de waarheid gesproken spreidt daarom de tapijten uit de tuin voor hem uit en open de poort van de tuin voor hem
2892219 0 heer laat het laatste uur spoedig slaan zodat ik bij mijn familie en mijn bezittingen kan zijn hem staan heel veel genietingen te wachten
2892220 slechte ziel kom naar buiten voor de wraak en de woede van allah de ziel verdeelt zich over het hele lichaam en wordt uit het lichaam getrokken zoals een pin uit natte wol wordt getrokken dan neemt de engel hem over als hij hem te pakken heeft laten de andere engelen het geen moment in zijn handen zij nemen hem en wikkelen hem in een ruigbehaard kleed waar een stank vanaf komt zoals de ergste stank van een iichaam in de wereld dan nemen zij hem naar boven en telkens als zij voorbij een groep engelen komen vragen dezen wie is deze slechteziel
2892221 ondergaat de straf van het branden dit komt door hetgeen uw handen hebben gewrocht allah is in het geheel niet onrechtvaardig voor zijn dienaren
2892222 mijn heer zend mij terug opdat ik recht doe in hetgeen ik heb achtergelaten
2892223 in geen geval het is slechts een woord dat hij uit
2892224 en als jij zou kunnen zien hoe het gaat met de onrechtvaardigen in doodsstrijd en hoe de engelen hun handen naar hen uitstrekken terwijl zij zeggen
2892225 zij zullen s ochtends en s avonds voor de hel geplaatst worden
2892226 laat fir aun en zijn volgelingen de hardste bestraffing binnengaan
2892227 ik zou allah gevraagd kunnen hebben om jullie te laten horen wat ik hoor van de bestraffing in het graf maar uit vrees dat jullie elkaar hierna nooit meer zullen begraven heb ik dit niet gedaan
2892228 zoek toevlucht bij allah tegen de ellende van het hellevuur
2892229 wij zoeken onze toevlucht bij allah tegen de ellende van het hellevuur
2892230 zoek toevlucht bij allah tegen de kwelling van het graf
2892231 wij zoeken onze toevlucht bij allah tegen de kwelling van het graf
2892232 zoek toevlucht bij allah tegen alle kwellingen zichtbaar of verborgen
2892233 wij zoeken onze toevlucht bij allah tegen alle kwellingen zichtbaar of verborgen
2892234 zoek toevlucht bij allah tegen de kwelling van ad dadjjaal de valse messias
2892235 wij zoeken onze toevlucht wat betreft de vreugde van het graf die de gelovigen is geschonken
2892236 wij waren aanwezig bij de uitvaart van een man van de ansaar bewoners van medina
2892237 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
2892238 o mijn volk aanbidt god gij hebt geen god naast hem ik vrees voor u de straf van de grote dag
2892239 hij is slechts een mens zoals gij hij zou zich boven u willen verheffen en indien het god had behaagd had hij voorzeker engelen nedergezonden wij hebben nooit van zulk een boodschapper onder onze voorvaderen gehoord koran 23 25 hij is slechts een bezetene wacht daarom een korte wijle ongetwijfeld zal hem iets overkomen
2892240 moeten wij een man uit ons midden volgen dan zouden wij inderdaad verdwaald en krankzinnig zijn 25 is de vermaning hem alleen gegeven neen hij is een grote leugenaar en misdadiger
2892241 o mijn volk aanbid god gij hebt geen god naast hem hij wekte u op vanuit de aarde en vestigde u er vraagt vergiffenis aan hem en bekeert u tot hem voorwaar mijn heer is nabij verhorende
2892242 o salih gij waart onze hoop verbied je ons datgene te aanbidden wat onze vaderen aanbaden en wij zijn voorzeker in verontrustende twijfel over hetgeen waartoe gij ons roept
2892243 wij geloven niet in hetgeen waarmee je zijt gezonden en wij zijn zeker in twijfel over hetgeen waartoe je ons roept
2892244 wil je niet godvruchtig worden waarlijk ik ben voor u een getrouwe boodschapper vreest daarom god en gehoorzaamt mij en ik vraag u er geen beloning voor mijn beloning is slechts bij de heer der werelden zul je met rust worden gelaten tussen de dingen die hier zijn tussen tuinen en bronnen en korenvelden en dadelpalmen vol vruchten en de huizen welke je met grote handigheid uit de bergen maakt daarom vreest god en gehoorzaamt mij en gehoorzaamt niet aan het bevel der buitensporigen die onheil op aarde stichten en zich niet beteren
2892245 gij zijt betoverd gij zijt slechts een mens zoals wij toon ons dan een teken als je tot de waarachtigen behoort
2892246 hier is een kamelin zij heeft haar beurt om te drinken en je hebt uw beurt om te drenken op een vastgestelde tijd en doe haar geen kwaad anders zal de straf van een grote dag u achterhalen
2892247 vermaakt u voor drie dagen in uw huizen dit is een belofte die niet geloochend kan worden
2892248 de tijd van dhor begint wanneer de zon zijn hoogste punt gepasseerd is en de schaduw van een mens in lengte gelijk is aan zijn eigen lengte en houdt aan tot de tijd voor asr komt de tijd voor asr houdt aan totdat de zon geel wordt de tijd voor maghrib houdt aan totdat de schemering vervaagd is de tijd voor isha houdt aan tot middernacht de tijd voor het subh fadjr gebed houdt aan vanaf het begin van de predageraad zolang de zon nog niet begonnen is op te komen wanneer de zon op begint te komen stop dan met bidden want het komt op tussen de twee horens van de shaytaan
2892249 de tijd van dhor begint wanneer de zon zijn zenit gepasseerd is en de schaduw van een mens in lengte gelijk is aan zijn lengte en houdt aan tot de tijd voor asr komt
2892250 de tijd voor asr houdt aan totdat de zon geel wordt
2892251 degene die n rakah van asr inhaalt voordat de zon ondergegaan is heeft asr ingehaald
2892252 de tijd voor maghrib houdt aan totdat de schemering vervaagd is
2892253 de tijd voor het subh fadjr gebed houdt aan vanaf het begin van de predageraad zolang de zon nog niet begonnen is op te komen wanneer de zon op begint te komen stop dan met bidden want het komt op tussen de twee horens van de shaytaan
2892254 het uur zal niet komen totdat de tijd zo snel zal passeren dat een jaar voorbijgaat alsof het een maand is en een maand als een week en een week als een dag en een dag als een uur en een uur als de tijd die men nodigt heeft om een palmblad te verbranden
2892255 the hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain
2892256 o awf ibn malik zal ik je 6 tekenen van het laatste uur citeren ik awf ibn malik zei wat zijn ze o gezant van allah hij s a w zei twee ernstige ziektes net als cholera en anthrax zal over jullie verspreidt worden sahih bukhari
2892257 het uur zal niet komen totdat de tijd zo snel zal passeren dat een jaar voorbijgaat alsof het een maand is en een maand als een week en een week als een dag en een dag als een uur en een uur als de tijd die men nodigt heeft om een palmblad te verbranden
2892258 de sleutels tot het leven van het hart zijn het nadenken over de qor aan en in stilte onderdanig zijn aan allah en zonden nalaten
2892259 een boek dat wij op jullie neer hebben gezonden vol met zegeningen dat hij die nadenkt over zijn verzen en dat hij die begrijpt er aandacht aan schenkt
2892260 wie ook maar mijn leiding volgt zal niet op een dwaalspoor terechtkomen noch zal hij in leed en ellende vervallen
2892261 de beste van jullie is degene die de qor aan leert en het dan onderwijst
2892262 en wanneer zijn verzen aan hen voorgedragen worden wordt hun geloof vergroot
2892263 denken ze niet na over de qor aan of zitten er sloten op hun harten
2892264 en wanneer mijn slaaf u vraagt o mohammed mij aangaande dan ben ik weliswaar dichtbij ik antwoord de aanroeping van de smekeling als hij om mij vraagt zonder een bemiddelaar dus laat hem mij gehoorzamen en in mij geloven zodat zij op de juiste weg kunnen worden geleid
2892265 indien de dienaar een zonde pleegt verschijnt er een zwarte plek op zijn hart en als hij dan naar vergiffenis zoekt wordt deze plek verwijderd
2892266 neen hun harten zijn bedekt met de zonden raan die zij zelf maakten
2892267 wie smeekt mij zodat ik hem mag antwoorden wie vraagt van mij iets zodat ik hem dat kan geven wie zoekt vergiffenis van mij zodat ik hem kan vergeven
2892268 had ik maar deed ik het maar z was ik maar
2892269 voorwaar allah is jullie heer en mijn heer aanbidt hem
2892270 dan maakten wij uit die kleine vleesklomp beenderen vervolgens bekleedden wij die beenderen met vlees
2892271 esh hedoe en laa ilaha illa lah wa enne mohammeden resoeloelah
2892272 er staat geschreven gij zult den here uw god aanbidden en hem alleen dienen
2892273 deze koran is een duidelijke aanwijzing voor de mensheid en leiding en barmhartigheid voor een volk dat overtuigd is
2892274 koran sura 8 vers 12 toen uw heer aan de engelen openbaarde
2892275 en knuffel de ongelovigen want de islam is vrede geef ze eten en drinken en weest vriendelijk
2892276 als de zon 1 cm dichter bij de aarde was gelegen dan was er geen sprake meer van leven
2892277 want alzo lief had jh de wereld dat hij een weblog bouwde ter redding van zijn medebloggers
2892278 dit is niet de beste manier maar het is mijn manier geweest om het nirvana te bereiken ik wil jullie enkel op weg helpen
2892279 moslim is vrede voor de ongelovigen jullie zullen spijt krijgen
2892280 o jullie die geloven vreest allah vol ware godsvrees voor hem en sterft niet anders dan als moslims
2892281 o mens vreest jullie heer die jullie schiep uit n enkele ziel en die daaruit zijn echtgenote schiep en uit hen beiden vele mannen en vrouwen deed voortkomen en vreest allah in wiens naam jullie elkaar om hulp vragen en onderhoudt de familiebanden voorwaar allah is de waker over jullie
2892282 o jullie die geloven vreest allah en spreekt het ware woord hij allah zal voor jullie jullie goede daden aanvaarden en jullie je zonden vergeven en wie allah en zijn boodschapper gehoorzaamt waarlijk die heeft een geweldige triomf behaald
2892283 ik voel me alsof mijn imaan is uitgeput het lezen van de qor aan doet me niks meer ik bega zo gemakkelijk zonden
2892284 het hart qalb komt van taqalloeb het verandert constant het hart kun je vergelijken met een veer die bij een boom ligt en constant door de wind wordt meegevoerd
2892285 het hart kun je vergelijken met een veer op een verlaten stuk land die constant door de wind wordt meegevoerd
2892286 het hart van de zoon van adam verandert sneller dan een pan kokend water
2892287 de harten van de kinderen van adam zijn als n hart tussen de vingers van de meest barmhartige en hij stuurt ze in welke richting hij wil
2892288 o allah bewaarder van de harten laat onze harten u gehoorzamen
2892289 en weet dat allah een afscheiding maakt tussen een mens en zijn hart en voorwaar tot hem zullen jullie worden verzameld
2892290 alleen hij zal gebaat zijn die naar allah komt met een zuiver hart
2892291 zodat hij wat de satan inwerpt als een beproeving maakt voor degenen in wiens harten er een ziekte is en wiens harten verhard zijn en voorwaar de onrechtvaardigen zijn sterk vijandig
2892292 die de barmhartige ongezien vreesde en die met een berouwvol hart kwam
2892293 mijn hele oemmah gemeenschap zal het goed vergaan behalve diegenen die openlijk zonden begaan
2892294 toen verhardden jullie harten zich daarna zodat zij als steen werden of zelfs harder dan dat want voorwaar er zijn stenen waaruit rivieren ontspringen en voorwaar er zijn er die splijten zodat er water uitstroomt en er zijn er die neervallen uit vrees voor allah
2892295 voorwaar de huichelaars proberen allah te misleiden en hij vergeldt hun misleiding en wanneer zij in de salat staan staan zij er lui bij om door de mensen gezien te worden en zij gedenken allah slechts weinig
2892296 mensen zullen stoppen om in de eerste rij te bidden totdat allah ze in de hel zal gooien
2892297 voorwaar zij wedijverden in goede daden en riepen ons aan verlangend naar onze genade en vol ontzag voor onze bestraffing en zij waren nederig tegenover ons
2892298 liefdadigheid is dagelijks nodig of vereist voor elk deel van je lichaam elke heilig is allah is een liefdadigheid elke alle lof is voor allah is een liefdadigheid elke laa illaha ilallah er is geen god dan allah is een liefdadigheid elke allaahoe akbar allah is de grootste is een liefdadigheid het goede bevelen is een liefdadigheid het slechte verdelgen is een liefdadigheid wat voldoende is voor dat als een liefdadigheid zijn de twee rakaat van doha
2892299 er zijn er 360 gewrichten in een mens en men moet voor elk een liefdadigheid verrichten
2892300 men kan het slijm of viezigheid dat men vindt in de moskee bedekken of iets schadelijks van de straat verwijderen als men dit niet kan doen kan hij twee rakaat van doha bidden en dat zal voldoende voor hem zijn
2892301 deze twee ahadieth wijzen op de grootsheid voortreffelijkheid en belang van het doha gebed die de wettigheid benadrukken dat de twee rakaaat voldoende zijn voor 360 liefdadigheden zoiets als dit het doha gebed zou met regelmaat en vasthoudendheid uitgevoerd moeten worden de hadieth bevestigt ook het belang van het zeggen van en en laa illaha ilallah en het belang van het goede bevelen het slechte verdelgen verwijderen van speeksel verwijderen van dat wat schadelijk is van de weg en zulke andere handelingen die de nodige dagelijkse liefdadigheden vervullen
2892302 zoon van adam bid vier rakaat voor mij in de vroege dag en het zal voldoende voor jou zijn voor het latere deel van de dag
2892303 de boodschapper van allah zond een expeditie en zij verkregen veel buit en keerde snel terug
2892304 zal ik jullie niet leiden naar een nabijere overwinning een grotere buit en een snellere terugkeer iedereen die woedoe e verricht en dan naar de moskee gaat om de doha te bidden dat is een nabijere overwinning een betere buit en een snellere terugkeer
2892305 mijn vriend de boodschapper van allah adviseerde mij om drie dingen te doen en ik zal ze niet in de steek laten tot ik sterf 1 drie dagen per maan maand vasten 2 het doha gebed bidden en 3 voor het slapen het witr gebed bidden
2892306 niemand van de metgezellen of volgelingen zijn bekend die het begrenst hebben tot twaalf rakaaat
2892307 ja sommige baden twee rakaaat en sommige baden vier rakaaat en sommige baden tot de helft van de vroege dag om was
2892308 de profeet bad vier rakaaat voor de doha en voegde er aan toe wat allah wilde
2892309 de boodschapper van allah ging naar de mensen van qoebaa e en zij waren de doha aan het uitvoeren
2892310 het gebed van vroomheid moet worden uitgevoerd wanneer de jonge gespeende kamelen de hitte van de zon voelen
2892311 iemand die vrienden maakt en bij wie anderen zich op hun gemak voelen er zit geen goedheid in degene die geen vrienden maakt en bij wie anderen zich niet op hun gemak voelen
2892312 zij die allah willen misleiden en lui in het gebed staan
2892313 het hart zal worden onderworpen aan beproeving na beproeving en er zal een zwarte vlek in zon hart verschijnen die groter zal worden totdat het hele hart zwart is en uiteindelijk bezegeld wordt het zal geen goede daad herkennen of enig kwaad bestrijden of proberen te voorkomen behalve als het hem goed uitkomt
2892314 als er een zonde op aarde wordt begaan zal degene die er getuige van is en het haat afkeurt dezelfde zijn als degene die er niets van weet degene die geen getuige is van een zonde maar het niet afkeurt zal dezelfde zijn als degene die er getuige van was
2892315 jullie verlangen er erg naar om leiders te worden maar jullie zullen er spijt van krijgen op de dag des oordeels want in het begin lijkt het gemakkelijk maar later wordt het een grote last dit betekent dat in het begin van een leiderschap dit rijkdom macht en plezier oplevert maar later loopt iemand het risico om vermoord of afgezet te worden en hij zal op de dag der opstanding ter verantwoording worden geroepen voor wat er onder zijn verantwoordelijkheid lag
2892316 zal ik jullie vertellen over leiderschap en wat het inhoudt ten eerste is het een verwijt ten tweede betekent het spijt ten derde is het een straf op de dag der opstanding behalve voor de rechtvaardige leider
2892317 laat degene die blij wordt als dienaren van allah voor hem opstaan zijn plaats in de hel innemen
2892318 geen van jullie mag een ander van zijn plaats af laten gaan zodat hij zelf kan zitten
2892319 en degenen die voor hen in de stad medinah woonden en geloofden de ansaar zij houden van degenen die vanuit mekka naar hen zijn uitgeweken zij vinden in hun hart geen jaloezie op wat aan hen gegeven is en zij geven aan hen voorrang boven zichzelf ook al is er behoefte onder hen en wie zich hoedt voor zijn eigen gierigheid dat zijn degene die zullen welslagen
2892320 gierigheid en imaan kunnen niet tegelijkertijd bestaan in het hart van de gelovige
2892321 pas op voor gierigheid want degenen die v r jullie kwamen zijn vernietigd door gierigheid het beval hen om gierig te zijn en zo werden zij het het beval hen om de familiebanden te verbreken en zij verbraken de familiebanden het beval hen om immoreel te zijn en zo werden zij immoreel
2892322 weet dat jullie degenen zijn die opgeroepen worden om bijdragen te geven op de weg van allah en onder jullie zijn er die gierig zijn en wie gierig is hij is slechts gierig ten nadele van zichzelf en allah is de behoefteloze terwijl jullie de behoeftigen zijn
2892323 o jullie die geloven waarom zeggen jullie wat jullie niet doen groot is de woede bij allah dat jullie zeggen wat jullie niet doen
2892324 degene die zich bezighoudt met twijfelachtige zaken het zal hem leiden naar de verboden zaken zoals een herder die zijn kudde vlakbij een plaats laat grazen waar hij niet mag komen hij zal die plaats betreden
2892325 op de dag der opstanding zal ik zeker de mensen herkennen die goede daden dragen zo groot als de witte berg van toehaamah en allah de verhevene zal het in stof veranderen
2892326 o boodschapper van allah beschrijf hen aan ons en leg het uit zodat we niet onbewust zoals zij zullen zijn
2892327 zij zijn jullie broeders en zij zien er hetzelfde uit als jullie zij bidden s nachts zoals jullie maar als zij een gelegenheid bespeuren om de grenzen van allah te overschrijden zullen ze het doen
2892328 de gelovige beschouwt zijn zonden alsof hij aan de voet van een berg zit en hij is bang dat die berg op hem zal vallen terwijl iemand die volhardt in verboden zaken zijn zonden beschouwt als een lastige vlieg die hij wegslaat
2892329 kijk niet neer op goede daden al is het maar je glas leegmaken en het vullen zodat iemand anders kan drinken of je broeder met een glimlach tegemoet treden
2892330 een man liep op zijn weg en zag een boomtak midden op de weg liggen en zei bij zichzelf
2892331 voor iedereen die een obstakel uit de weg ruimt ten bate voor de moslims zal n goede daad worden opgeschreven en degene van wie een goede daad wordt aanvaard zal het paradijs binnengaan
2892332 de relatie tussen de gelovige en zijn broeders is als de verhouding tussen het hoofd en de rest van het lichaam de gelovige voelt de pijn van zijn broeders zoals het lichaam reageert op pijn in het hoofd
2892333 twee van jullie die bevriend zijn omwille van allah en gaan uit elkaar omwille van allah zullen uit elkaar gaan door de eerste zonde die n van hen begaat
2892334 niemand zal dwalen nadat hij is geleid behalve wanneer hij twistziek wordt
2892335 ik garandeer een huis in het paradijs aan degene die een discussie vermijdt ook al heeft hij gelijk
2892336 imaan en afgunst bestaan niet tegelijkertijd in het hart van de ware gelovige
2892337 toen de profeet hem naar jemen stuurde adviseerde hij hem
2892338 is het voor degenen die geloven nog geen tijd dat hun harten zich vernederen voor het gedenken van allah en wat is geopenbaard van de waarheid de qor aan en laten zij niet worden als degenen aan wie de schrift de tawraat voorheen was gegeven toen werd de tijd voor hen te lang zodat hun harten verhardden en de meesten van hen zijn zwaar zondigen
2892339 onze broeders zijn ons dierbaarder dan onze families onze families herinneren ons aan deze wereld en onze broeders herinneren ons aan het hiernamaals
2892340 we keken in onze harten en voelden een ingrijpende verandering
2892341 hij is gedoemd de slaaf van de dinar en de dirham
2892342 voor ieder van jullie is de voorziening van een reiziger voldoende
2892343 en weet dat jullie bezittingen en jullie kinderen slechts een beproeving zijn en dat er bij allah een geweldige beloning is
2892344 voor de mensen is de liefde voor begeerlijke zaken als vrouwen aantrekkelijk gemaakt evenals de liefde voor zonen omvangrijke gouden en zilveren bezittingen gemerkte paarden en kudden dieren en akkers dat is de genieting van het wereldse leven en allah bij hem is de beste terugkeer
2892345 in deze wereld zijn vrouwen en parfum mij heel dierbaar en mijn oog vindt verkoeling in het gebed
2892346 kinderen zijn de oorzaak van verdriet lafheid onwetendheid en gierigheid
2892347 elke natie heeft zijn beproeving en de beproeving van mijn natie is weelde
2892348 als er twee hongerige wolven op een kudde schapen worden losgelaten zullen zij niet m r schade berokkenen aan de kudde dan de schade aan het geloof van een mens door zijn drang om meer geld te vergaren en zijn positie te verhogen
2892349 al wat men nodig heeft van rijkdom is een dienstbode en een vervoermiddel om op reis te gaan op de weg van allah
2892350 wee degene die geld wil oppotten behalve hij die voortdurend weggeeft aan degene rechts van hem en aan degene links van hem aan degene voor en achter hem
2892351 laat hen eten en zich vermaken en worden afgeleid door de valse hoop later zullen ze het weten
2892352 waar ik wat jullie betreft bang voor ben is dat jullie je begeerten volgen en dat jullie hopen dat jullie lang zullen leven want je begeerten volgen betekent dat je de waarheid niet onder ogen ziet en het verlangen naar een lang leven betekent het hiernamaals vergeten
2892353 vier zaken zijn de oorzaak van mislukking droge ogen nooit huilen uit vrees voor allah een verhard hart verlangen naar een lang leven en dol zijn op deze wereld
2892354 is het voor degene die geloven nog geen tijd dat hun harten zich vernederen voor het gedenken van allah en wat is geopenbaard van de waarheid qor aan en laten zij niet worden als degenen aan wie de schrift tawraat voorheen was gegeven toen werd de tijd voor hen te lang zodat hun harten verhardden en de meesten van hen zijn zwaar zondigen
2892355 hij die geen lang leven wenst zal minder zorgen hebben en zijn hart wordt gevuld met licht omdat hij de dood gedenkt en daardoor allah meer zal aanbidden
2892356 hij die teveel eet teveel drinkt en teveel slaapt zal veel beloning verliezen
2892357 geloof in jullie harten verslijt net zoals jullie kleren verslijten dus smeek allah om jullie geloof in jullie harten te vernieuwen
2892358 er is geen hart die niet is bedekt met een wolk zoals de maan wordt bedekt met wolken of het wordt plotseling donker maar wanneer de wolken wegtrekken zal de maan weer schijnen
2892359 hij is degene die de vrede in de harten van de gelovigen neerzond opdat zij geloof zouden toevoegen aan het geloof dat in hen was
2892360 en wanneer er een hoofdstuk is neer gezonden dan zijn er onder hen de huichelaars die zeggen
2892361 wie van jullie een slechte daad ziet laat hem het met zijn handen veranderen via daden als hij dat niet kan dan via zijn tong woorden als hij dat niet kan dan via zijn hart door het innerlijk te verwerpen en dat is de zwakste vorm van het geloof
2892362 wij waren met de boodschapper van allah vrede zij met hem toen wij een vallend geluid hoorden waarop de profeet vrede zij met hem zei weten jullie wat dat is
2892363 de afstand tussen de schouders van een ongelovige is gelijk aan de periode die een snelle paardrijder in drie dagen aflegt
2892364 de kies van een ongelovige of zijn hoektand is even groot als oehoed en de dikte van zijn huid is als een wandeling van drie dagen
2892365 jij bent mijn bestraffing waarmee ik straf wie ik wil
2892366 degene die de qoeran bestudeert en uit zijn hoofd leert en daarbij de geboden en verboden van allah aanvaardt zal door allah worden toegelaten in het paradijs hij zal hem ook voorspraak verlenen voor 10 van zijn familieleden die bestemd zijn voor de hel
2892367 aanbidt niemand anders dan mij en betoont vriendelijkheid jegens de ouders
2892368 en de hel is zeker de beloofde plaats voor hen allen
2892369 zij heeft zeven poorten en elke poort heeft een gedeelte hunner toegewezen gekregen
2892370 het is aan mij geopenbaard dat een groep der djinn heeft geluisterd naar de koran en zij zeiden waarlijk wij hebben een wonderbaarlijke verkondiging gehoord
2892371 o edelen welke onder u zal mij een passende troon voor haar brengen voordat zij onderdanig tot mij komt
2892372 ik zal deze tot u brengen voordat gij van uw kamp opstaat en zeker heb ik daar macht over en ik ben betrouwbaar
2892373 wilt gij er iemand plaatsen die er onheil zal stichten en bloed zal vergieten terwijl wij u verheerlijken met de lof die u toekomt en uw heiligheid prijzen
2892374 vrees niet want wij zijn tot het volk van lot gezonden
2892375 vrede zij u gaat de hemel binnen voor hetgeen gij deedt
2892376 de doodsengel aan wie gij toevertrouwd zijt zal uw ziel nemen dan zult gij tot uw heer worden teruggebracht
2892377 vrede zij over u omdat gij geduldig waart ziet hoe uitstekend is het uiteindelijke tehuis
2892378 o malik laat uw heer een einde aan ons maken
2892379 ik ben met u versterkt de gelovigen ik boezem ontzag in de harten der ongelovigen slaat daarom hun hoofd af en slaat alle toppen van hun vingers af
2892380 o wee ons wie heeft ons van onze slaapplaatsen gewekt dit is hetgeen de barmhartige heeft beloofd en de boodschappers spraken de waarheid
2892381 het is iets schadelijks blijft dus gedurende de menstruatie van de vrouwen weg en gaat niet tot haar in voordat zij hersteld zijn maar wanneer zij zich hebben gereinigd gaat tot haar in zoals god het u heeft bevolen god bemint hen die zich tot hem wenden en zich rein houden

2892384 oh yeah i know exactly what you mean same thing happens to me
2892385 because i dont want many things for my birthday im finding
2892386 it will send a message to everyone that this path doesnt work
2892387 they do not know what is friend they would rather have angry enemies than real friends
2892388 investors will not put up the money for a bypass pipeline
2892389 we will do anything not to allow georgia and ukraine to join nato
2892390 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals
2892391 that the crocodile is hungry well from the point of view of someone who wants to keep his own leg thats hard to accept
2892392 at the end of the day we were very close to war
2892393 these are not two different things because its not amputating hand its amputating head or heart no georgian president could survive if he gave up on abkhazia
2892394 if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for georgia then we have to make decision
2892395 a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice
2892396 their grand ambition is to undo the post cold war settlement and to re establish russia as a dominant power in eurasia
2892397 anything we can do to weaken the u s is good for russia

2892403 these may seem small improvements but as we look back on the past year indeed the past five years it is difficult to describe how tough life has been
2892404 the good news is that we have started thinking positively again and that we are back in our church
2892405 i always have a spot in my services where people can talk to me and tell me what has been happening
2892406 the stories are all awful and a reminder that although the level of violence in baghdad is becoming less the results can still be devastating on a personal level
2892407 one terrified woman told the congregation that she had just been to the market and that a woman next to her had been killed
2892408 another person had witnessed a car being blown up but had escaped unscathed
2892409 the stories of death and destruction chaos and tragedy continue but among them all was a simple gratitude to god for survival
2892410 for my people christmas is a reminder that their faith is the only thing they have to hold on to in a time when they have been surrounded by death and destruction
2892411 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
2892412 we place emphasis on applied sports psychology in our programs in other words the psychology of human potential and performance
2892413 we look for ways of helping individuals do what they do to the best of their ability not just in the performance but in the whole experience its important for athletes of all ages to raise enjoyment of the activity to the fullest level
2892414 they harbor expectations about the outcome of the game from themselves or from their parents or peers people tend to worry about things they cant control they worry about whether theyll win or make the shot instead of focusing on effort attitude and motivation
2892415 this is the paradox of control and paradox of success the way to give yourself the best chance of achieving success is to stop thinking about it if you focus instead on things you have control over you can increase the likelihood of success
2892416 parents can help kids re focus to things like energy effort and concentration
2892417 if someone is upset over a loss you can ask are you upset because you did all you could and you lost or because you didnt do all that you could and you lost
2892418 a parents primary question after a game teaches the child what is important
2892419 its far better to ask did you have fun or what did you learn than did you win when parents value improvement and fun over the score of the game the child begins to place more emphasis on learning and enjoyment the shift emphasizes the process of the sport rather than the results of the game it comes back to placing value on things that the child can control
2892420 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
2892421 if its a multiparty case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
2892422 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
2892423 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
2892424 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
2892425 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
2892426 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
2892427 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood
2892428 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
2892429 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
2892430 clearly there was anxiety about what sort of model we should have to move towards a republic
2892431 there will be a day in this nation im absolutely confident when we will be a republic
2892432 but labor is taking this in a measured way we understand that ultimately this is a matter that the community needs to settle a view on
2892433 im not a great fan of the word narrative but i can tell you very easily what this governments about
2892434 its about designing and implementing the long term plans that matter for this nations future
2892435 and foremost amongst them is making sure that weve got a productive and prosperous economy for the future

2892437 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2892438 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2892439 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2892440 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2892441 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2892443 i had never experienced anything like this being around the most awesome group of people i have ever been around
2892444 a lot of other directors have started out making documentaries and gone on to do fiction
2892445 it just gives you a real feel for reality and people and for dealing with all kinds of issues that you have to force in a way when youre dealing with actors real people just do it
2892446 our goal with making the documentary that we made was just to kind of give a different look at the special olympics
2892447 its kind of one of those organization that everybody knows about but nobody knows about
2892448 on any given day there are 84 special olympics events going on
2892449 one by one pretty much every person in the crew came up to me and thanked me for letting them be a part of it
2892450 i could tell that this experience touched them in a way that they hadnt expected
2892451 even for his age he was lifting some pretty heavy weights
2892452 it was really inspiring i was really scared for him he looked fragile i guess only because i knew he was 71 years old
2892453 he looks his age but hes doing things that i didnt think 71 year olds could do
2892454 he really had a great message and it was that sports is for all ages no matter how old you are you can play a sport
2892455 i feel really excited about it because this is our first project thats actually going somewhere
2892456 its a real television credit that we can use on our resume
2892457 especially for young filmmakers dealing with actors and trying to get them to do emotions that youve never experienced yourself or have no idea when youre 18 or 19 is kind of tough with documentary though you can ask the right questions and you can really listen to people
2892458 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life

2892461 the biggest threat to the eight is the french in the relay they have posted the best times coming into beijing and it will be a fierce battle
2892462 if you listened to the new york giants throughout last season they really believed in themselves when no one else did we also believe in ourselves we have nowhere to go but up
2892463 if you look at the internet chat boards for soaps and reality shows the audiences are asking the same question why is the character doing this theyre both a way to measure your own life
2892464 cbs has the oldest median age of a broadcast network and reality shows draw a much younger target audience than daytime dramas
2892465 if theres a magic bullet this is probably going to be it
2892466 i do think if you were flipping through the channels you wouldnt say oh this is a soap opera im not going to stop
2892467 means not to give up even when things dont go the way you want them to
2892468 is when you say something nice about somebody or something

2892492 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
2892493 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

2892501 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2892502 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2892503 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2892504 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2892516 the greatest guilt today is that of people who accept collectivism by moral default the people who seek protection from the necessity of taking a stand by refusing to admit to themselves the nature of that which they are accepting the people who support plans specifically designed to achieve serfdom but hide behind the empty assertion that they are lovers of freedom with no concrete meaning attached to the word the people who believe that the content of ideas need not be examined that principles need not to defined and that facts can be eliminated by keeping ones eyes shut

2892572 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2892573 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have

2892620 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the us army
2892621 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
2892622 we dont have any statistics but we consider there are between 400 000 and 450 000 refugees from iraq here
2892623 jordans population of five million has grown by 750 000 with the arrival of the iraqi refugees
2892624 most refugees want to go home most dont want to go somewhere new and restart their lives
2892625 at this time most iraqis in jordan dont see a situation where they can return and some will never ever be able to go back
2892626 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in google and i couldnt believe it when i found him and saw his picture
2892627 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
2892628 we feel its our nations responsibility to help ivraa is a way to correct some mistakes
2892629 i feel a bit responsible as a former military officer for some of the displacement of iraqis
2892630 based on the documents presented to them they believe salah qualifies for the special
2892631 now in the streets of jordan i walk like this
2892632 but sometimes im still afraid i will be sent back to iraq i always think about this always
2892633 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world

2892641 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2892642 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2892643 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2892644 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

2892648 thank you all its nice to be here and to see everyone in such a fine mood ive never seen bill bennett this happy with anything that didnt have a handle on its side
2892649 oh come on rush twenty more milligrams and that wouldve been damn funny
2892650 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2892651 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2892652 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2892653 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2892654 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2892655 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2892656 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2892657 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2892658 the policy gutlessly fails to challenge the cannibalistic premise that the needs of some are a compulsory claim on the earnings of others
2892659 were a compassionate and fair people whose instinct is to give a person a helping hand when they need it

2892662 this particular item of cannibalism the dpb has an instructive history
2892663 neville keys plan and his other proposals for getting beneficiaries into the work force repairing as they do to ludicrous personal development and employment plans drawn up by unemployable bureaucrats amount to a more costly convoluted version of the
2892664 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2892665 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2892666 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2892667 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2892668 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2892669 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2892674 in the beginning of the contest with britain when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayers in this room for divine protection our prayers sir were hread and they were graciously answered all of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of superintending providence in our favor and have we now forgotten that powerful friend or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance god governs in the affairs of men
2892675 prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business
2892676 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2892677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2892678 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2892679 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2892680 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2892681 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2892682 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2892683 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2892684 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2892685 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2892686 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2892687 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2892688 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2892691 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2892692 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2892693 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2892694 hey babe will you come look at the meals and try to give me an idea of what else to put on the boys plates i dont think they are going to eat this
2892695 i dont know hey i know you want to wait until wednesday to go grocery shopping but you might want to go earlier
2892696 now the rest of this is pretty much unquoted because i dont know exactly what came out next what i heard however was this
2892697 yeah just grouchy i dont know why i think it must be pms
2892698 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2892699 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2892700 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2892701 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2892702 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2892703 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2892704 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2892705 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2892706 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2892707 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2892708 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2892709 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2892710 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2892711 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2892712 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2892713 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2892714 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2892715 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2892716 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2892717 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2892718 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2892719 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2892720 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2892721 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2892722 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2892723 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2892724 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2892725 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2892726 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it

2892734 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2892735 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
2892736 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2892737 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2892738 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
2892739 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2892740 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
2892741 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
2892742 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
2892743 if a company doesnt have a competitive 401 k program in place its going to be very difficult to compete for talent

2892745 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2892746 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2892747 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2892748 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2892749 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2892750 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2892751 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is
2892752 if the person is not thats viewed as a personal affront to clinton ive heard that repeatedly
2892753 i hope that in the next three months those folks will have an awakening in terms of whats at stake in november
2892754 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2892755 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2892756 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2892757 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2892758 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
2892759 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party
2892760 many of these calls we are getting are from people who have finally reached a point where they want to change their lives
2892761 this program has been the difference between life and death for me
2892762 i really dont know if i would be clean today if i didnt have this help
2892763 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2892764 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2892765 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2892766 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2892767 we have recorded one killed in action and 10 wounded from our troops as of this monday morning
2892768 but the military has information that there are also heavy casualties on their milf side
2892769 we have sufficient stocks of basic necessities for the evacuees
2892770 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2892771 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2892772 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2892773 combined elements of police and military are conducting hot pursuit operation
2892774 we hope the operations will resume sooner in the day
2892775 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2892776 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2892777 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2892778 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2892779 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2892780 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2892781 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2892782 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2892783 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2892784 you told me more about the process than i know
2892785 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2892786 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2892787 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2892788 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2892789 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2892790 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2892791 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2892792 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2892793 we knew they wouldnt start without us said team captain tom hoff
2892794 id rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think we should be doing and him telling me i dont think so rather than sitting where i am now
2892795 talked with my wife for an hour because she had not left the states to come here and we talked about whether she should come shes a lot stronger than i am so she got on the plane
2892796 you have to live your life you cant live your life in fear or anger you just send your prayers to the families and try to do what you set out to do and thats win the gold medal
2892797 wiz played on the 2004 olympic team and traveled to beijing with her parents to cheer on her friends the bachmans were known as passionate supporters of american volleyball
2892798 shes an amazing woman from an amazing family and its just the worst possible thing imaginable were saying prayers for that family all of our hearts are heavy
2892799 but i think we also have a new inspiration and a perspective life is short enjoy it love the people youre with
2892800 the bachmans absolutely did that so well theyre such a loving family its so sad its overwhelming inside
2892801 ah syarikat bas ni dah kaya setakat 20 sen ni nak beli tosei pun tak cukup

2892804 i still have to prove myself these guys that i work with every day theyve been doing this in their sleep since i was a little kid so if i have to play a whole game then so be it
2892805 this is a situation that could possibly happen in the regular season
2892806 i remember when ruben brown the bears starting left guard from 2004 07 said there are going to be seasons when a guy never gets hurt and theres going to be a season where everybody could get hurt so you have to be ready
2892807 i just want to do more positive than negative out here on the football field
2892808 thats just an honor unto itself think about it six pro bowls he must be doing something right so every time he speaks im silent and i listen and i try to soak it up like a sponge

2892955 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2892956 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2892957 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2892958 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2892959 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2892960 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2892961 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
2892962 using the meade etx 100 objects you can really see
2892963 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2892964 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2892965 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2892966 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2892967 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2892968 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2892969 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2892970 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2892971 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2892972 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2892973 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat

2892979 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2892980 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2892981 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2892982 they want the whole of georgia the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea
2892983 in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this region must be got rid of
2892984 understands its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america
2892985 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2892986 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces
2892987 the president believes that there now exists a real chance of quickly finding a way out of the crisis

2893008 were glad theyre going to be able to take it up and carry it forward it kind of lets us believe the people there are reasonable and willing to accept the cooperation of the county and village to solve a mutual problem
2893009 its giving them municipalities the ability to raise taxes without taking the grief

2893017 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2893018 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2893019 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2893020 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2893021 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2893022 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2893023 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is

2893027 when youve got to operate an event like this weather really rules the day
2893028 the triathlon is a new hip sport and more people are coming into it
2893029 the run was my favorite because i got to be by myself and think

2893031 it was a nice ride and i thought it was paced well
2893032 were gonna get something good to eat and relax a little bit
2893033 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2893034 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2893035 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2893036 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2893037 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street

2893205 john mccain has said that improving veterans health care would be his top domestic priority as president yet he has repeatedly voted against increased funding for veterans health care and now he offers up an plastic card option that will lead to privatization of veterans health care no one knows how to help and heal veterans like veterans had i ended up in a regular hospital after returning from iraq i would lost my arm mccains plan will only hurt the va and our veterans more than they are already hurting
2893206 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2893207 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush

2893219 there are times youd like to lash out and say something but at the same time you have to step back and look at the situation first
2893220 thats more of an emotional or rash decision to go out and say something
2893221 you have to figure out why certain things are happening and look at the plus side of it this is a situation where theres definitely a big plus im getting the chance to play with one of the best players in the game and im getting to learn and see how he prepares himself
2893222 you have to know your place and know your role

2893232 hes a terrific technician he has sound fundamentals hes very athletic has good hands he puts visuals in right spots hes in tune with the pitchers the biggest thing is in game adjustments hes gotten a much better feel for that part of it
2893233 i like what im seeing nobody is hanging their head
2893234 at no time in the past 50 years has this happened without the economy being in an official recession
2893235 the path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom and i dont think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms i think that is quite a dangerous game to play
2893236 i think what separates my call say from the consensus is that i dont necessarily think this is going to be a mild flash in the pan i think this is going to be a long recession

2893260 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is

2893265 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2893266 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2893267 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2893268 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2893269 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
2893270 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party

2893280 hell he can have all my cows im just making sure he knows im a bull
2893281 father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing
2893282 if we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
2893283 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2893284 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2893285 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2893286 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2893287 insgesamt bin ich mit meiner leistung in peking zufrieden ich kann doch nichts daf r dass die weltspitze so weit weg ist

2893297 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2893298 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2893299 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk

2893303 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2893304 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe

2893316 that is tremendously a disservice to our community it is a disservice to individuals that want to be trained and placed in jobs with livable wages its unacceptable
2893317 we must remember that the new age religion is the very foundation for the new world government without the luciferian global religion the antichrist dictatorship of the new world order is completely impossible that is why the project blue beam is so important to the antichrist luciferians and has been so well hidden

2893320 at the last olympic games in 2004 the americans easily won the gold with two invasions in the previous three years with britain getting the silver russia didnt even show we havent won the gold since 1996 when the judges were impressed by our levelling of grozny this year i expect russias armed forces to get the gold back for us ive already received a call from our olympic committee telling us that the judges are impressed by the reported civilian death toll and by the synchronised obliteration display put on by our heavy artillery israel were briefly in with a shout which is absurd they didnt even do a proper invasion of lebanon they just bombed an airport russia shows the world how this sort of thing is done old school style
2893321 its absurd that russia is using this in an attempt to win olympic glory its like something from a satirical news website or something

2893358 we even had to pass a special law in the congress just a few weeks ago to allow student prayer groups the same access to school rooms after classes that a young marxist society would already enjoy
2893359 if a state refused to let religious groups use facilities open to others then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility toward religion the establishment clause does not license government to treat religion and those who teach or practice it as subversive of american ideals
2893360 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion

2893389 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2893390 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2893391 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
2893392 hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver
2893393 hillary clinton will be speaking on tuesday night in prime time president clinton will be speaking on wednesday night their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2893394 we had four parties to try to get to agreement on a lot of different issues
2893395 the company will persist in the direction of introducing strategic investors and will continue to develop opportunities of business cooperation with strategic investors of world renown
2893396 although the agreements have expired singapore airlines will explore other means of developing the relationships
2893397 singapore airlines continues to be optimistic about the prospects for chinas airline industry
2893398 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2893399 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2893400 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2893401 the more relevant bloggers become in terms of audience and influence the more their production routines resemble those of professional journalists
2893402 more than one blogger said a key turning point in the way they practice blogging was the moment they felt the gaze of the public eye realizing that people are paying attention has led these bloggers to adopt a more careful dispassionate approach and tone
2893403 i was more creative when i started now im more deliberate i started trying to be more professional once i got to 100 readers i started to get more organized and started to take more responsibility for what i posted then i started to restrict what i put up there ive ducked a couple of issues recently because i wanted to be better informed i didnt want to be wrong so i just avoided the topic
2893404 ive written about a candidate and said simply that the candidate has been in office too long and should go i know more and there are rumors i could check out but i chose just to say that about being there too long
2893405 whereas constraints necessitate routines so does a lack of limits bloggers have developed routine practices that narrow down possibilities
2893406 like journalists do not meet or converse with most of their readers directly
2893407 beat routine in journalism which ensures a steady predictable stream of stories
2893408 each blog has loyal followers who post comments and send e mails and bloggers tend to write to these individuals much as journalists write for each other
2893409 i hope you will find the time to tell me why this news story is not reported by your paper
2893410 this is a very hard story to prove and i think that has frozen people in place
2893411 our interest in that story was not in his private romantic life
2893412 it was in his relationship with lobbyists plural and that story took many many weeks of intensive reporting effort

2893414 i know that there have been a lot of questions on this subject senator barack obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected i want to assure everyone we are working together with senator obamas campaign and the dnc and i am confident we will have a successful and unified convention in denver
2893415 kochamy wszystkich tak e rosjan ale ju rosyjskiej polityki wobec nas nienawidzimy
2893416 oh and the mccain campaign has accused barack obama of being elitist and using the race card yeah yeah the obama campaign accused mccain of being old and using the discover card
2893417 yesterday president bush announced there are going to be some big changes in intelligence in the white house yeah hes leaving
2893418 well listen barack obama accused republicans of trying to make others fear him because and i quote he doesnt look like the other presidents on the dollar bill so the choice is do you want to elect a guy who doesnt look like the president on the dollar bill or do you want to elect a guy who looks older than the president on the dollar bill
2893419 yeah thats the big talk they say barack obama could decide to go with another woman see thats what killed john edwards chances of being vp he decided to go with another woman
2893420 and barack obama told tom brokaw the other day on meet the press that what hes looking for in a vp is a person who will tell him when they thought he was wrong to which president bush said trust me that gets old really fast
2893421 and as you know the mccain campaign is running that commercial where theyre comparing barack obama to various hollywood celebrities and as you know if theres one thing the republicans will not stand for its electing some hollywood celebrity to public office except for ronald reagan fred thompson arnold schwarzenegger clint eastwood you know except for those
2893422 but i think the u s is going to do well particularly in swimming i think we have a very strong swimming time this year for the olympics yeah thats right dick cheney in particular looks great in the freestyle waterboarding
2893423 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
2893424 mccain is not backing down hes defending the commercial where he compared barack obama to paris hilton as being all talk and little action thats what he said like paris barack obama is all talk and little action really has he seen her sex video there is no talk it is all action
2893425 barack obama told tom brokaw the other day what hes looking for in a vice president is someone who would tell him when hes wrong wouldnt hillary be the best candidate shes been telling him hes been dead wrong since the beginning on this

2893439 people go through the motions of an election only to have them discarded and disregarded
2893440 tragically an election was held the president lost they refused to abide by the will of the people
2893441 this guy is a fraud a liar and hes going to lose 100 of your money by the time this is all finished
2893442 he says as opposed to losing other peoples money which is of course how guys like him usually get rich
2893443 after education i have settled down at pondicherry started a web designing company moved on to web hosting got married and got a kid
2893444 jan was behind me i was pushing hard and i was trying to make up some time
2893445 i just turned the car in too quickly and got on the inside curb the car shot across to the exit curb and then onto the grass by the time i was on the grass there was no way i could hold it
2893446 im all right but im disappointed with myself for making such a mistake
2893447 it was a pretty big impact of all the places to go off the kink is not the place to do it the car did stand up extremely well to the accident it looked like it was going to be close at the finish but unfortunately nothing seems to be going right for us this year
2893448 first we won the race which was great for corvette racing second we proved once again that safety is always paramount at corvette racing it was an unfortunate accident for olly and while the car was damaged the driver emerged unscathed thats a testament to the importance we place on safety
2893449 we provided a great deal of exposure for champ car by displaying their banner prominently on the front of the no 4 corvette after its encounter with the wall in the kink
2893450 without a budget signed by the governor no funding can be released at all
2893451 so not only do we have this permanent loss of funds but currently we are not even getting funds that were allocated
2893452 i know that mchenry county will come through for us again
2893453 we are determined to close this budget gap and not allow our programs to be eliminated
2893454 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2893455 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2893456 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2893457 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2893458 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2893459 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2893460 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is
2893461 if the person is not thats viewed as a personal affront to clinton ive heard that repeatedly
2893462 i hope that in the next three months those folks will have an awakening in terms of whats at stake in november
2893463 its giving them municipalities the ability to raise taxes without taking the grief

2893583 the natural history unit is the leader in its field and what happens there has reverberations way beyond the bbc

2893587 our people pulled it out of the water right away
2893588 the mother nudged the baby to make it get on its feet but on the pictures it looks like she wanted to flatten it
2893589 however elephants always do that and they do it very carefully with their feet and their trunk
2893590 people are saying that if they have to they will fight back
2893591 i told the young people that they shouldnt fight back it is the order of the government if you fight back it will hurt the dogs in the long run
2893592 i have to sneak them out quickly into my car
2893593 its a matter of ones personal life and tastes you should be able to have as many dogs as you like
2893594 im convinced generalized reciprocity will be very widespread and found in many different animal species as our study suggests that an underlying evolutionary mechanism is responsible
2893595 it is very difficult to make predictions about how prevalent its likely to be
2893596 animals have to meet frequently and have to remember what other individuals have done and how they acted in the past that means animals have to possess high cognitive abilities and for these reasons it hasnt been demonstrated very often
2893597 its a simpler mechanism and therefore more likely to be evolutionarily important
2893598 if when assailed by the ostrich the man stands erect he is in great danger but by the simple expedient of lying down he escapes all danger

2893600 the pseudo occultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorizing and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision all such worthless rubbish is not worth the power and shot of argument in order to form a just estimate of the sacred science we must study originals and try to penetrate the minds of the great mystics whose works bear evidence of first hand knowledge of the supersensible worlds
2893601 it is through your body that you realize you are a spark of divinity
2893602 for most of us however we only think seriously of food or sex or money when it becomes a problem which is to say when we feel we are not getting our share when we find ourselves in that situation then i regret to say that meditational visualisations are really not the best way to remedy the lack we are here in a physical condition in a physical world and while in that state we have to abide by the laws appropriate to it
2893603 the biblical texts have been strained out through a greek latin mindset which is very surface and static
2893604 the imprisoned titans underneath the soil grinding writhing take your strength from them throw aside your petty drawing room point of view

2893619 sometimes we dont make time to put character in place in the curriculum but they need it
2893620 this is going to be a lifelong building of respect responsibility and determination
2893621 were taking those character words and were building lesson plans around them
2893622 a major challenge will be getting schools to embrace this in a climate where most everything is centered around students passing the crcts criterion referenced competency tests
2893623 theyre putting very little money in it but if the community gets the chance to understand what its all about they can make it happen
2893624 schools writing grants and local sponsors are what keep these programs going
2893625 weve had some grants weve applied for money we want to reinvigorate the efforts but its all pending on funding
2893626 he was able to really concentrate deeply on the topics
2893627 i think the students started to realize that their manners were not right when they realize what theyre doing is not the norm they will follow the norm you have to change their mind set
2893628 its important for these students to have these virtues here and at home
2893629 when they go to other schools and other places theyll have good discipline and good character
2893630 i think its going to grow more than anything else
2893631 i think with a new school it will bring great results
2893632 they were diamonds in the rough for some time but thankfully we were able to find someone to save them before they were lost
2893633 i want to be part of making this place come back alive again and if people like me dont do that then these places will continue to decay
2893634 somebody hanged themselves from a second story porch from one of these houses but i researched that and just couldnt find anything that said that
2893635 the only way to truly save a building is to give it a use
2893636 these are very prominent buildings right at the gateway to downtown
2893637 when these houses are saved the history that goes with them will be saved as well
2893638 i have people with me around the clock im never by myself my daughters came down and arranged that
2893639 if i really told you my life youd be about dead and wished to god id died
2893640 somebody in the family died and left me 2 000
2893641 my friend caroline nixon scott nixons wife had a brother who was in some consulate in london and caroline was going with her mother and her two children and they said you want to go genie and i said you think 2 000 will take two of us sure they said so i took my daughter and we went to europe for four months
2893642 there was no running water we had a pot my daughter elizabeth said what is that thing i said its where youre going to sit and go to the johnny
2893643 and i think theyve made my life the happy thing that its been
2893644 the more friends you have and hold onto and love the happier you are
2893645 i would love to die tomorrow if i thought i could
2893646 ive outlived my life here i can no longer garden i can walk and i ride that exercise bike but i cant see i cant hear what do i do with myself when you cant read life is hell i cant write because i cant see
2893647 to turn on that wretched thing remote control to turn on the television
2893648 i get my nose right up to it and it diverts me because i cant do anything else
2893649 and take a little nap every day after lunch stretch your body out and let it recuperate
2893650 we lived in that big house on walton way and everybody either rode the bicycle or walked
2893651 there was no gasoline no cars no nothing and so they had to come by our house on walton way so they stopped in and we always had a houseful of young people and now all those young people the children are my friends which is wonderful and now theyre dying so fast so anyway its been a long eventful life
2893652 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
2893653 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
2893654 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2893655 i felt an edge in terms of my ability to take an opportunity when it comes around
2893656 its a good situation that you can ask that question
2893657 i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
2893658 unfortunately it hasnt happened that doesnt mean that im not in the right track so im looking forward to the challenges and i just am going to keep giving it my best and its just a matter of time
2893659 given to me by an aunt when i was very young because she said i buzzed around in the house and got in trouble it stuck with me

2893663 the tradition of mowing lawns carried on through me when i was in high school
2893664 he just kept us in stitches he has a habit of doing silly things sometimes
2893665 i dont want to say everyone was against it they were against the timing
2893666 we were doing financially well but i didnt like being away from home at night being away two to three days at a time is not good for a young marriage
2893667 hes always done a fantastic job of client service if a client needs something he gets it done
2893668 hes a special person as far as customer service he learned that the hard way in college it has paid off big time for him puts clients interests first
2893669 like most children you grow up wanting to be like your father
2893670 during the summers i would dress up in my sunday best and come up here with him and act like i was working doodling around stapling papers
2893671 it is what i always had in my mind what i was going to do
2893672 i remember in high school coming here on the weekends i was the human collator of his presentations
2893673 i didnt get the cfa to be the only one in augusta i did it for customer service
2893674 i look back on it how did i commute every day an hour each way i was a little younger then
2893675 we have a fiduciary responsibility to our clients just like an attorney does we got to be 100 percent put all of our clients goals and objectives ahead of our own
2893676 ive been fortunate over the years the type of investments that i have our clients have we eat our own cooking
2893677 a lot of people get comfortable hes always been reading always been on top of things he could see what was coming down the road and he could gear his business toward that
2893678 mom came out with pitchers of lemonade he said we didnt practice well enough to deserve a lemonade he poured it out in front of all of us
2893679 what i get out of it is you dont get things for free you dont get lemonade just cause you show up
2893680 i was 50 years old and out of shape you jog for a quarter of a mile
2893681 there are two young girls that run with you and you cant let them show you up im glad it wasnt any more than a quarter of a mile
2893682 thats the way we like to do business its a courtesy to our female guests

2893699 this is one of those service things that we need
2893700 todos los brigadistas y simpatizantes as como toda la gente que est dispuesta a defender el petr leo
2893701 los potentados con el apoyo de la derecha panista y la c pula pri sta quieren privatizar la industria petrolera
2893702 como si fuese poco el da o que ha hecho al pa s para acabarla de amolar el grupo que se cree amo y due o de m xico pretende entregar a particulares los recursos estrat gicos de la naci n

2893704 lo menos que debemos hacer es cuidar el petr leo
2893705 la situaci n de pobreza que viven en sus comunidades no es producto de la casualidad sino de la corrupci n y de malos gobiernos y sin los recursos de la factura petrolera resultar a dif cil superar la actual situaci n econ mica y se profundizar an los niveles de pobreza y de marginaci n adem s de que se incrementar an los ndices de inseguridad y violencia
2893706 no es un gobierno de izquierda por que si lo fuera no violar a los derechos humanos
2893707 no son de izquierda los gobiernos de cualquier partido que violan las garant as de izquierda los que desobedecen los mandatos populares
2893708 entonces el gobernador me dijo que los muchachos agredieron quebraron vidrios y no s qu pero bueno la desesperaci n hace que la gente haga algunas cosas que no deber an
2893709 un ego smo narcisismo que te lleva a creer que puedes hacer lo que se te antoja
2893710 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2893711 the kremlins expanding military push into georgia is fueling concerns within washingtons national security establishment of a broader challenge to u s power globally during president george w bushs waning months in office
2893712 the limited ability of the bush administration to protect georgia is particularly alarming to many u s foreign policy analysts who say it marks the latest in a string of pro western governments or political movements that have come under attack in recent months but which have received little more than rhetorical support from washington in response
2893713 a trade embargo against russia would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face because of the wests dependence on russian oil and gas
2893714 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2893715 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines
2893716 they hedge their bets a little with inflation and it is not clear that inflation has peaked
2893717 im not sure that this adds to the case for a september cut and i dont think it adds to the case for 50 rather than 25 basis points
2893718 i thought it sounded interesting and i wanted to meet new people
2893719 i think the forensics one is the most popular because of the crime scenes that are on television
2893720 forensics is fun its a fun way to learn science
2893721 my mom told me about these chemistry camps so i thought sure
2893722 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2893723 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2893724 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2893725 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2893726 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2893727 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2893728 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2893729 my major goal was to finish this race without reinjuring my left calf muscle and i did
2893730 when youve got to operate an event like this weather really rules the day
2893731 the triathlon is a new hip sport and more people are coming into it
2893732 the run was my favorite because i got to be by myself and think
2893733 just because of the experience of doing it and knowing you can accomplish something that you set out to do
2893734 it was a nice ride and i thought it was paced well
2893735 were gonna get something good to eat and relax a little bit
2893736 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2893737 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2893738 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2893739 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2893740 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2893741 without a budget signed by the governor no funding can be released at all
2893742 so not only do we have this permanent loss of funds but currently we are not even getting funds that were allocated
2893743 i know that mchenry county will come through for us again
2893744 we are determined to close this budget gap and not allow our programs to be eliminated
2893745 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2893746 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2893747 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2893748 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2893749 for women to increase fertility and for men to increase sexual desire
2893750 derived from the egyptian word for january which was when chicory was harvested and eaten many thousands of years ago in egypt
2893751 folklore reports from afghanistan before the wars described the use of aqueous root extracts of cichorium intybus l as a light sensitive plant remedy for malaria
2893752 american indians used the crushed leaves on insect bites and the root was chewed to allay fear at night
2893753 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2893754 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2893755 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2893756 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2893757 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2893758 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2893759 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2893760 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is
2893761 if the person is not thats viewed as a personal affront to clinton ive heard that repeatedly
2893762 i hope that in the next three months those folks will have an awakening in terms of whats at stake in november
2893763 when you sit on these committees you really have to understand the issues and ask the right questions
2893764 all of these department heads were buying computers and i wanted to make sure all the machines would all be able to work together and talk to each other
2893765 education is the key to the future for each person
2893766 scholarships often make the difference between someone being able to attend college or not every student ive met is so appreciative
2893767 learning allows you to make new friends and contribute to society i just like to keep current everyone should continue to learn no matter how old they are
2893768 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2893769 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2893770 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2893771 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2893772 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
2893773 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party
2893774 many of these calls we are getting are from people who have finally reached a point where they want to change their lives
2893775 this program has been the difference between life and death for me
2893776 i really dont know if i would be clean today if i didnt have this help
2893777 weve really been working on building our partnership with the elgin symphony for the past few years this is just a magnificent opportunity
2893778 this is probably the biggest name weve gotten in town not only to perform with the orchestra but with students in the area as well
2893779 the goal is to make sure theres not another family that will go through what we went through
2893780 thats a lot more manpower they can cover a lot of territory
2893781 the way the game is played it puts it closer to election time
2893782 i want to make a statement i want a lot of family members there i want a lot of signatures
2893783 obviously the more money you bring in the more you can do
2893784 gannon and duarte are not ones to stay in five star hotels and eat in five star restaurants they want to stretch the money as far as they can go
2893785 we have a phenomenal location with great visibility off i 90
2893786 we ran into a problem with a florida hotel over the name
2893787 those decisions and planning are always in a constant state of flux
2893788 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2893789 you told me more about the process than i know
2893790 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2893791 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2893792 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2893793 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2893794 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2893795 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2893796 if we would have had weather like today all summer it would have been great
2893797 primarily were at the mercy of mother nature these are very sophisticated watersheds that drain into our lakes
2893798 well try and get out more regularly but i dont know if well make up for lost time
2893799 its disappointing but therere people in much more dire straits
2893800 aside from the impact of fuel prices our performance remains on track
2893801 may not be serving the interests of either airlines or passengers
2893802 resilient domestic canadian market drove sustained revenue growth and we achieved unit growth through the successful introduction of a number of fare increases and fuel surcharges
2893803 there is a 30 possibility that we will have to implement more reductions on the long haul network but i will do everything i can to avoid dropping another destination
2893804 have you ever wanted to know what it takes to promote your own work

2893810 i am deeply troubled by the specter of job losses
2893811 raises the question if dhl will still be able to effectively compete against ups some critics of the proposed agreement contend that dhl will become a captive of ups rather than an independent competitor
2893812 the biggest concern that we have is that we are no longer talking to airplanes
2893813 we can do without radar in an emergency but we need to talk to airplanes
2893814 they said when they fixed it the last time it was caused by computer card problem
2893815 any system that run 24 7 occasionally theres going to be an outage
2893816 outages are very very rare and were very adept at handling them
2893817 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2893818 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2893819 its giving them municipalities the ability to raise taxes without taking the grief
2893820 initial eav and current eav can be applied to a single parcel or property within a tif redevelopment area or an aggregate of all property within the tif or a combination of the two
2893821 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2893822 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2893823 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2893824 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2893825 you told me more about the process than i know
2893826 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2893827 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2893828 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2893829 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2893830 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2893831 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2893832 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2893833 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2893834 the corps had a spectacular performance and drew multiple standing ovations
2893835 the kids felt very good about themselves and thats what its all about
2893836 ill have to admit that any one of the top four corps could have won
2893837 we hope to make it interesting intellectual and very emotional
2893838 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2893839 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2893840 i figure that any day i wake up and im not staring at the inside of an urn is a positive day for me
2893841 so if you ask me as you did am i content with this piece of work my answer is yes
2893842 it gives me a chill they are the dearest nicest kindest people you would ever want to meet they were just spiffy
2893843 i have a very hard anthracite core to my being
2893844 what monstrosities would walk the street if peoples faces were as unfinished as their minds
2893845 josh and i tried to write a very unsentimental piece about a society in which a paris hilton because of her looks is valued and a schoolteacher has to flip burgers at wendys in order to feed his family thats what its all about its a condemnation of our superficial society set in the milieu of a mutant virus
2893846 this weasel this mongrel this mt everest of stupid executives
2893847 in years to come if my name still has any coin and anyone remembers me i think people will be talking about the discarded
2893848 kein staat hat das recht das staatsgebiet eines anderen staates mit milit rischen mitteln zu verletzen nur weil einige b rger dort p sse des intervenierenden staates besitzen
2893849 jedes mal wenn sich in europa ein staat dieses recht herausgenommen hat f hrte das zu einem krieg und wir haben die pflicht uns daran zu erinnern wie sich adolf hitler vor etwas mehr als einem halben jahrhundert dieses recht herausgenommen hat um weite teile mitteleuropas anzugreifen
2893850 alle beteiligten m ssen jetzt eine friedliche l sung anstreben
2893851 die bundesregierung wird versuchen dies auf diplomatischem weg zu unterst tzen vor allem sind jetzt aber die konfliktparteien gefordert wir brauchen so schnell wie m glich einen waffenstillstand
2893852 just wanted to say i enjoyed your piece in the national on ian anderson froots editor disguised as a piece on paul simon hats off to that
2893853 seth lakeman has sold over 100 000 cds to people who mostly dont give a toss about
2893854 his songs are currently heard by several million listeners tuning in to radio 2
2893855 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2893856 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2893857 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2893858 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2893859 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2893860 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2893861 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2893862 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2893863 because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and more than every beast of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life i wil put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel
2893864 as per standard procedure the captain returned to the terminal to allow for a technical assessment of the problem
2893865 id have dinner with the guy and wed talk about sports or hed ask me about my life was i dating anyone
2893866 he was a priest but he was a normal guy
2893867 ive seen a couple that had actually gotten in trouble and i thought ok i can see that not so with father killion
2893868 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2893869 its simple really were giving michael phelps and kimmie meissner to the other 49 states theyre giving us nothing why should we continue to be dragged down by their failures
2893870 some will accuse maryland of not being patriotic but we did save the whole countrys ass in the war of 1812 so they can suck it
2893871 who the hell did you think it was madeline the matriarch this is my house damn it you know that why are you beating him up what the hell is going on here
2893872 we we have been hunting for you youre m missing
2893873 get me my first aid kit from the cupboard in the hall madeline instead of standing there like an idiot
2893874 your scoot was reported wrecked by one of the harvester crews
2893875 she said there was lots of blood on the scene and you didnt call in major nalzac assumed well weve been searching the upper levels for you we thought he might have carried you off to the runaways in the dead sections then early this morning we got a report in that someone had seen a large unaccompanied male near here we stalked the place and heard a male speak so we hit the place hard and fast hes big and we didnt take any chances im sorry
2893876 the scoot broke down axle broke i cut my head in the accident and howard carried me home hes big but hes just a baby and the gentlest thing alive damn you madeline
2893877 wed better get him to hospital and if he dies ill kill all three of you
2893878 he tried to protect me and he cant even protect himself now will you fetch the first aid kit and call an ambulance
2893879 you can do it yourself and im going to charge him with threatening to assault officers come on girls lets get out of here
2893880 captain lagarda here i need to report a breaking and entry and an assault on the person of my man
2893881 i had a scoot accident last night but im fine otherwise you cant say the same about my man i have just had my home broken into and my man attacked ill need an ambulance
2893882 i can provide positive id on the three yes looks like a bit of blood on the glass they broke and i have one nightstick im afraid this is going to be an icd affair sarah it was captain rodgers lieutenant rubia and co lewis howard was just making my morning coffee when they broke in and attacked him
2893883 they left when i told them they were under arrest
2893884 i was trying to do emergency first aid on their victim so i couldnt stop them
2893885 i didnt know what do lani i was in the kitchen trying make breakfast
2893886 who did you speak to they say they heard you speak
2893887 rohans secretary recommended a place the hosts name is de ron and the inns called
2893888 dont stay at an inn after you were so cooperative about letting me go over to meet with the duke the least i can do is extend the hospitality of my fathers house weve got plenty of room
2893889 we have this wonderful chance to avenge the failure of ducos plot to assassinate the pope in rome it has fallen to us into our laps like a ripe plum we did nothing to seek it out the stone brothers two of the three culprits are right here to think that antoine delerue predicted that we were unlikely to encounter them again
2893890 antoine is scarcely a prophet certainly not an infallible one count your lucky stars that theyre staying at sandrarts house
2893891 and keep your face out of public view maybe they wouldnt recognize any of us and wouldnt remember having ever seen us talking to michel anywhere in italy but then again one of them might talk about good luck if the sandrart son hadnt invited them theyd be right here at the swan and wed be huddling in the sleeping chambers all day to avoid them
2893892 another heaven sent predestined foreordained clearly god given opportunity wasted because of michels
2893893 working within the limitations that our leader has placed upon us is an exercise in humility
2893894 at least tell michel about it why did he and antoine have to go as far away as scotland what can they possibly be trying to accomplish in scotland of all places
2893895 i will send another letter to him explaining what has happened after that all we can do is wait for his further directions
2893896 something involving real estate buying an estate called stockau its over near ingolstadt somewhere in pfalz neuburg
2893897 didnt that belong to the abominable wolfgang wilhelm before he got himself killed in the essen war last summer
2893898 thats the one if you can think of a triangle between augsburg munich and augsburg its in there
2893899 its noble land so its tax exempt for all practical purposes plus being a way for milkau to lever his family up into the nobility if he played his cards right but somewhere along the way he bribed the wrong person or didnt bribe the right person or something
2893900 like he maybe told wolfgang wilhelm something that amounted to treason to get him to approve the sale
2893901 you are young to be so suspicious my friend ron the problem i think is that the purchase would have made him
2893902 fanatics yes zeloti these zealots are using their knowledge to force him to finance their projects whatever their projects are he is not sure but he believes that he is probably not alone that they are extorting money from other prominent members of the calvinist diaspora
2893903 your father is important and rich therefore you have ties to influential men in the state of thuringia franconia and through them into the highest circles of the use he thought that you might be able to bring the problem to the attention of the appropriate persons discreetly of course naming no names since you are a friend of his future son in law but letting someone know of the existence of the zealots that they have established themselves in frankfurt
2893904 we started off last year with just the sock hop celebrity auction and silent auction we just felt that a car show was just a natural fit
2893905 this is definitely a learning experience for the car show ive gone to them but i didnt know everything thats involved
2893906 i have a couple of them here if anyone wants to come in and practice
2893907 everybody last year had a great time people enjoy the 50s back when there wasnt all this technology and life was a little simpler
2893908 everyone loves to look at cars so hopefully theyll just come out have a good time and help support us and our marketing efforts to promote tourism and travel
2893909 admiral khumalo is waiting for you in his day cabin
2893910 that was in the nature of a rhetorical question captain
2893911 it does however rather neatly sum up my current dilemma doesnt it i doubt even someone with your own obviously extraordinarily active imagination is truly up to visualizing the reactions of myself and baroness medusa when ericsson delivered your ah missive to us mr oshaughnessy in particular seemed quite perturbed by your conclusions and projected course of action
2893912 frankly despite any past differences of opinion with mr oshaughnessy i found it just a bit difficult to be critical of his reaction

2894384 the shift toward free ad supported sites should prove to be more lucrative said murdoch who plans to conclude his purchase of the wall street journal before the end of the year the journal with about 1 million subscribers is one of a few publications that have made a business of selling content online but the number of users could increase to 10 million to 15 million if the site were free murdoch told shareholders in a speech in australia that would mean the site could charge more to advertisers who want to reach that broader audience or any part of it
2894385 the lesson seems to be that online consumers will pay only for niche content of intense interest to them but most consumers expect free mainstream content including news and mass audience entertainment whether they find it on
2894386 subscriptions thrive in an area where theres scarcity content that people cant get anywhere else

2894392 historically typewriters have been an issue because their parts can be turned into weapons
2894393 is very heavy and could be used as a club
2894394 its disappointing that the department of corrections could not have found a middle ground that protected inmate safety while allowing some access to typewriters
2894395 inmate restrictions should be linked to actual and demonstrable safety risks especially when they affect a fundamental right such as access to the court system
2894396 the ban on typewriters was implemented for safety and security and is in no way intended to affect inmate litigation

2894406 the award is recognition for your leadership in raising public awareness about consumer rights
2894407 i am truly honored to receive this award the consumer federation has been in the forefront of the effort to protect consumers in this state through the information they provide and their tireless advocacy
2894408 i believe that government plays an important role in protecting the public both by reducing unfair costs and eliminating dangerous practices by unscrupulous businesses the business community can only benefit by the increased trust that is brought by responsible regulation and i hope to continue to work with the consumer federation of california to develop guidelines in a rapidly changing world and pass these guidelines into law as the next state senator from the 19th district

2894419 300 film composer tyler bates signs on to score codemasters rise of the argonauts
2894420 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2894421 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
2894422 in rise of the argonauts every design choice emphasises immersion we want players to actually feel like theyre heroes in ancient greece not just playing a game tylers experience with composing for film and tv gave him a fresh perspective and his music for the game set the epic tone we were hoping for

2894453 we must get the science right or we shall get the policy wrong
2894454 if you introduce an emissions trading scheme when it transpires that the scheme and its associated economic damage had never been necessary and it will and sooner than you think you and your party will be flung from office perhaps forever it is therefore in the long term vested interest of your party to think again
2894455 eliminate the payroll tax and replace it dollar for dollar with a co2 tax
2894456 may require policies that seek not only to decrease co2 emissions but to eliminate them entirely
2894457 we must abandon the conceit that individual isolated private actions are the answer they will not take us far enough without collective action

2894460 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2894461 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
2894462 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
2894463 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
2894464 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
2894465 other organizations do a variety of things they do voter registration and voter education and they actually take out the vote themselves

2894481 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2894482 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2894483 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2894484 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2894485 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2894486 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2894487 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2894488 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2894489 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2894490 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2894492 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2894493 we are very pleased to have this opportunity to assist another australian patent owner with the complex process of defending their valuable intellectual property the unauthorised use of australian technology by large multinational organisations significantly reduces its commercial benefit which in turn impacts the success and progress of australian business
2894494 when we felt the application was ready to be launched
2894495 we made the strategic decision to seek a partner who could help us with financing marketing and the general business structure
2894496 we will not be selling woopra at this early stage
2894497 we are still the owners i cannot enter into too many details at this moment as the program has only just been launched all i can say is that we have a very decent amount of funds compared to other start up projects like facebook or youtube
2894498 i then started learning about other tracking and analytics services and discovered success measuring methods other than just number of hits per day
2894499 by 2005 i realized that everything on the web was moving toward socializing and social networking everything except my analytics services google analytics still only offers numbers and statistics that wasnt enough for me i wanted to know more about who is viewing what on my virtual property whos stumbling on it how did they know about it was it possible to get in contact with them and perhaps even guide them
2894500 thats basically where i lived for a year for months we worked non stop often more than 15 hours per day sometimes we would finish work at 5am and join our friends for breakfast when they came back from a night out in batroun it didnt really bother us but i must admit our social life was totally screwed up
2894501 i dont think it is the task of a university to offer support for a project like woopra
2894502 the main role of the lau was teaching us the basics discipline and methodology a couple of teachers really supported us especially my supervisor dr munjid musallem what lebanese universities lack is the ability to make entrepreneurs they always prepare you to work in a company our universities are generally producing employees instead of creating long term inspirational projects
2894503 we have the worst internet connection in the middle east which is terrible yet this helped us to tackle the worst case scenarios and debug our code easier
2894504 this is not a compliment it is a shame really that at times we had to use a dial up modem because all the alternatives were down for days we had major problems rolling updates it used to take 4 to 6 hours to roll an update while in the us it takes less than five minutes the government has promised the adsl lines for 3 years yet we are still not able to set up an adsl account in byblos
2894505 throughout his first semester elie told me about his ideas that would later shape up to become woopra
2894506 woopra was elies brainchild and his primary obsession no one could have stopped him from pursuing his woopra side discussions about woopra were regular and naturally it was the subject of elies final graduation capstone project
2894507 jad clearly stood out when he presented the tradeoffs of client server versus multi tier and peer to peer design which is very important in the software architectures to which woopra subscribes
2894508 in short i consider myself the lucky teacher of two software gurus
2894509 the same happened with google yahoo mosaic the predecessor of netscape and many other products
2894510 but realistically some critical technologies do not take off until us based organizations give it their blessing and join in
2894511 there is much more technical expertise vision and entrepreneurial support in the usa than in any other place the database industry oracle sql server db2 is almost entirely located in the us even though many innovative database ideas have been emerging in europe for a very long time
2894512 we have a couple of drafts that we are trying to merge but we cannot reveal any further details for marketing and business reasons at this stage jad and i will continue development to keep woopra ahead of the competition while moving back and forth between lebanon and the us
2894513 what is ethical journalism benjamin franklin said the effects of the written word delivered by press in his day in ours by a variety of media are more extensive more lasting what are journalists responsibilities and why

2894521 he had this fabulous smile and a great twinkle in his eyes
2894522 the first thought that went through my mind when i met him was uh oh stay away from that one
2894523 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
2894524 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
2894525 when you care for someone with anything like this you have to be on such an intimate level that a lot of people cant handle it and walk away with the care that i give him your guard has to be totally down and you have to be totally open all i know is i cant imagine being with anyone else and feeling as strong for them as i do for this man
2894526 there are a lot of disabled people in this boat who love each other and want to be together
2894527 as long as were ok with god we dont care what the government thinks
2894528 he just has this personality that completely shines through everything
2894529 when people tried to talk me out of this i had a simple answer
2894530 he still has a stack of story ideas that he just couldnt get to
2894531 which can be found at the follwing http www stickcricket com showthread php t 21188
2894532 we are not insisting that the tenancy contract should be in the applicants name the contract can be in the name of his close relatives also such as a brother or sister
2894533 we are being very flexible and taking each application on a case by case basis for example if a family does not have children a studio flat in their name is more than enough to get a family residence permit or if a family with one or two children can show that they are sharing a three bedroom apartment with a close relative it will also get them the residency status

2894568 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate
2894569 from what im hearing from new democrats the republican party no longer represents their values
2894570 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2894571 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2894572 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2894573 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2894574 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you
2894575 thats why what happens here is a microcosm for what happens nationally
2894576 i had applied for a job at a supermarket and was scheduled for an interview when i saw an ad for a larvae sighter
2894577 when people see me hanging around their back yards they do want to know what im doing
2894578 they suddenly become fascinated with mosquito control and some even go into the woods to watch me work
2894579 i search for jobs on the internet and there are plenty to choose from
2894580 when i was younger i used to go into the woods all the time
2894581 after i graduated from high school my mom helped me buy a car and get my car insurance

2894589 since gerard was having a difficult time i made his hole bigger to help him lie down for a little bit gerard was very cold i was also cold and began to shiver on purpose to create heat i was wasting energy but i needed to get warm
2894590 i made sure not to fall asleep because i could have fallen over
2894591 all of a sudden i saw an avalanche coming down it was only 20 metres to my right i saw the body of gerard sweep past me
2894592 when you are up in the mountains its easy to become friends but it was particular with gerard
2894593 the beard everything he looked like christ he was always smiling he was a flower
2894594 we had made our plans and even the weather was good
2894595 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
2894596 so nobody really thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
2894597 you know hes obama not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
2894598 weve made progress when the worst thing you can say about a black man is that hes elitist
2894599 whoop it up for the ragged trousers put the lazy greasy fizzle who cant pay his debts on the altar and bow down and worship him what we need is not the respect of our fellow men but the chance to get something for nothing
2894600 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2894601 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2894602 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2894603 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2894604 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2894605 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2894606 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is

2894670 john mccain has said that improving veterans health care would be his top domestic priority as president yet he has repeatedly voted against increased funding for veterans health care and now he offers up an plastic card option that will lead to privatization of veterans health care no one knows how to help and heal veterans like veterans had i ended up in a regular hospital after returning from iraq i would lost my arm mccains plan will only hurt the va and our veterans more than they are already hurting
2894671 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2894672 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush

2894709 you get older you just cant do time like you did
2894710 she said this is a better opportunity to show who you really are

2894712 you can either continue to be part of the problem or be part of the solution
2894713 my struggle with drug court and other types of specialty courts is i continue to feel these are major societal problems that society refuses to deal with
2894714 if drug courts were filled with more white men than black men then i think society could see it more as a health epidemic than a crime problem
2894715 we need to recognize this for what it is this is a public health issue
2894716 society needs to deal with it in a very different manner
2894717 its great for those 13 people but as a system is it really working
2894718 if you ask me if it is working im going to tell you yes because i see people succeeding

2894754 channels help advertisers feel more comfortable because they know the advertiser is doing something against specific content
2894755 what we have found in a lot of cities is that when we go to actually buy we can bring in the buys for less than we planned
2894756 its very rare for rates to go down but we are seeing in major east coast midwest and west coast markets instances where costs per gross ratings point are going down
2894757 we all know the economy is bad and its a natural thing to cut the rate to get more units
2894758 my feeling is they are buying more for less and negotiating good prices now but as they get closer to election day i suspect that trend will reverse itself
2894759 there will probably be a steady stream of pirate copies of these various events and for each event you will have a handful of rogue versions
2894760 but for some moments from the games instant replay types they will be viewed millions of times including unauthorized clips on dailymotion youtube streaming sites and others in ways that werent paid for by broadcasters who have secured exclusive rights
2894761 that acts as a forensic stamp you can track back to the last place it came from and itll give you hints as to what system it came from
2894762 its an investigative measure so when nbc finds it on a user generated site it can be taken down and traced back to where the original pirate took it from
2894763 networks had more original programming and thats why weve stopped the erosion
2894764 we were promised original shows in the summer and its happened
2894765 but i guess somewhere deep inside in advertisers minds you hope for a good mix of original scripted fare as well as original unscripted and you worry moving forward that the trend will lend itself more to reality when you see a lot of money and effort being put into original scripted shows that are doing average at best and half the ratings of things like hells kitchen and americas got talent

2894787 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50

2894796 i can say with confidence that neither the pakistan army nor any of the past governments of pakistan was ever involved or had any knowledge of a q s proliferation activities the show was completely a q s
2894797 it is too late for the concerned government and musharraf to confess the consequences for the country would be too drastic especially from the americans who have been supporting musharraf through thick and thin

2894806 r amp d is basically seeking out new knowledge and the question is where are the good ideas
2894807 after world war ii the good ideas were loaded up in a small number of large companies
2894808 product markets got more competitive and those big companies couldnt sustain the long term investments in research that they could in the earlier period
2894809 so today no one has locked up the really good ideas
2894810 these are the big research challenges that we think are most important to our customers in the next decade
2894811 i opened this store about a year ago business has been ok now i dont know how im going to afford to fix it up
2894812 its an amazing experience and ive got absolutely no intention of giving it away
2894813 i dont intend to retire in the next term of government or opposition

2894825 as the report released by my department shows students are missing out on vital services sporting opportunities welfare services counselling services the kinds of things students rely on and need while theyre at university
2894826 we have invested already 500 million through our better universities renewal fund and that money can be used for student services for the capital development for student services if universities choose
2894827 vsu has had a devastating impact on campus life and culture but also on essential support services that student organisations provide to help students while theyre at uni
2894828 the rudd government wants every university and indeed every school in this country to be a provider of excellent education
2894829 thats why we support all of the universities in this nation and support schools whether they are in the state system the private system or the catholic system
2894830 we want people to have choice and we want every choice to lead to a quality education
2894831 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
2894832 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us
2894833 the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2894834 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
2894835 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to a half a meter between the two sets of players
2894836 all i know is that if there is a rule and if it applies to one team it applies to both teams
2894837 the referee has to blow according to the rules and not according to his interpretation its that simple
2894838 if i looked at reserve scrumhalf and i have to choose between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez and i sent fourie back i would have to have my head read
2894839 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn i told ruan and frans it is great to have you here but if fourie or jaque are back then you are at the back of the queue again
2894840 i told them you can go back and decide where you want to play but with every decision there is a responsibility and that responsibility is that if you choose to play flyhalf you must know there are players ahead of you
2894841 the same goes for scrumhalf there you must know bolla conradie fourie and ricky januarie are all ahead of you
2894842 ruan is a very good player but as a scrumhalf i have to ask if he does all the basic things that a scrumhalf has to do
2894843 this is what i look for and i have to be honest about these things if ruan and frans were playing badly then it would be easier but they arent playing badly
2894844 the coach is possibly wrong but i have to choose and stick by my decision both are great players but there are players here who have a little bit extra because they are specialists
2894845 i didnt have the year i wanted to have last year i could only control my part and obviously i didnt play as much as i wanted
2894846 hes worked his tail off thats never been an issue hes a good character person i think he can play and he can add something to somebodys position
2894847 its a situation where you want to go where you are celebrated not tolerated
2894848 in many ways i look at this as a gift
2894849 my elbow got caught in a guys chin strap buckle
2894850 the door is open to any player we feel makes us better but there is no one out there at this time that we feel strongly about
2894851 polanco got one in the wind and carlos came two or three steps in and then had to sprint to the track
2894852 it was a swirling wind i was glad its 420 feet out there carlos has good makeup speed
2894853 it was not simple because the wind was kind of wild at first i thought it was in front of me but if i hurried and got too tight i might drop the ball so i tried to stay loose i knew id get there easy
2894854 pretend im not here and that im a flie on the wall

2894857 a mccain ad shows pictures of wind driven turbines while the narrator says
2894858 it was crazy came out of the last corner someone pushed me in the back the next thing i saw was kind of a black car in the middle track smashed from the back to the side then my car was destroyed
2894859 i banged the steering wheel so hard i think i bent it from how upset i was
2894860 i just want to understand who started all of this cause that is crazy someone hit me in the back first spun my car around the next thing there was a black car stopped i was wide open let off and on the brake someone was pushing me and i ended up in the wall
2894861 it was a heavy impact against the wall but my chevrolet car was awesome with the hans device and the protection of god i am alright
2894862 im going to continue my duties and test for hendrick motorsports on the road courses and want to thank all the race fans for supporting me and for my family and god to protect me and ill see you next round
2894863 it was a lot of fun out there today i just want to thank all my guys on the bass pro chevrolet we had a really good car all day we charged from 17th where we started early in the race for a long time we were one of the best cars on the track that last set of tires we got a little bit too loose but had a lot of fun out there today just want to thank bono kevin manion crew chief back at the shop for building this new car all the guys there that continue to work so hard day in and day out had a great engine under the hood today so i got to thank ecr engines for that just a lot of fun today it was great to get another top five its been a while coming
2894864 we ended with a good finish for our shell pennzoil impala ss it was a great points day for us but just as important it just continues to show how strong our team is we started out loose and wheel hopping but todd berrier crew chief made good pit calls and we kept getting the car better as the race went on we needed a couple more cautions to pit for more adjustments but all in all we rallied from a car that wasnt quite right to a good car at the end
2894865 not a whole lot what are we going to do to get a good finish i was happy we had a good car we learned a lot at the saturday race i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that sort of did foil our strategy more important i think is trying to get the car more durable i really wasnt running that hard out front and i was actually slowing down and taking it easy when jimmie johnson was catching me i didnt push the issue any harder and the front brakes just quit on it if we can fix that and get the thing where it will turn i dont know as the day goes it gets hot and slick
2894866 i just drive them tony eury jr might be trying something in there but he wouldnt get too crazy his deal is just to give me a chance every week and he wouldnt take too many risks i was proud of my team our motors are really good at the end that was about the only thing that did right was go straight but it went straight fast my team worked really hard we had a good car we were fast in practice lead some of the race just ran out of car strategy got messed up there at the end we should have done something different but i dont know i really didnt know what the strategy was and what tony jr and the guys were really trying to make happen up there but i know it didnt work out for us
2894867 no not at all we just struggled today we really missed the set up there wasnt much we could do about it other than just fight
2894868 yeah we lost probably about 15 seconds on that probably 20 seconds total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit steve letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even while i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that and so we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th you know the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
2894869 yeah oh yeah well i wasnt exactly sure because when i first saw it the funny thing was the fuel it stumbled back through the inner loop and i thought oh this thing must be getting close and i wondered when they were going to call me in and then i saw the black flag and i was saying hello hello i started talking to them and thats when i knew we were in trouble i was just hoping to make it back around i didnt know if i was going to make it back
2894870 oh its miserable its about as frustrating as you can get as a team as a driver its not any one persons fault were all in it together we have some work to do you know we had this same issue at the beginning of the sonoma race but we got some cautions to work on it we didnt have the cautions to work on it early enough here and it bit us but my car was probably the fastest car out there for two laps laughs and after that it was one of the slowest cars we know it and weve got to work on it hopefully next year well get an opportunity to come here or go to sonoma and test at those tracks because weve lost that magic that we had at one time
2894871 yeah i dont know i couldnt tell you i was running my own race i was so far away from what was happening up front i couldnt tell you i just know that we werent getting good fuel mileage and that was just another one of the things that were hurting us
2894872 i was right behind it i barely missed it i made a pretty good move getting into turn 1 and got by three or four guys i came around and saw mcdowell and the no 38 i guess got together and when he hit the wall i was just trying to pull right and stay away from it and just barely missed him i looked in my mirror and just saw guys plowing into it and i knew it was bad
2894873 no i cant believe we are where we are in the points to be honest with you if it werent for us having such an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too at indianapolis it was exciting and it was great to be running up front but it was one of those weird crazy races but i really feel like weve been gaining on our 1 5 mile program but we have absolutely missed our road course program and we even went and tested and i thought we were going to be pretty good we were good on our short runs in testing and here but we just didnt make enough long runs and thats what were going to have to work on
2894874 i help out with jcp cares and they asked me to be in the fashion show
2894875 we thought it would be a great way for our children to give back as well
2894876 it would be a fun way for them to lear about giving back to their community and to others in need
2894877 they are the product of being in the system and we want the kids to have a good feeling of self esteem when they go back to school this year
2894878 i like helping other people and my mom does it and i look up to her
2894879 this is the only church that ive ever belonged to
2894880 weve had some times that werent as good as other times but we thank god for what it was
2894881 they started with little to nothing with just faith in god that they can build a church and here we are some 100 years later we have the church that began some 100 years ago that is very exciting

2894888 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2894889 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2894890 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk

2894895 with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
2894896 as president mikheil saakashvili shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2894897 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2894898 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the
2894899 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2894900 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2894901 we will not tire we will not falter and we will not fail
2894902 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all
2894903 mccain i have respect for although not nearly as much as i did before 2001

2894931 it is more about weakness in other economies in the eurozone for instance
2894932 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2894933 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar
2894934 the rba appears to be turning more concerned about the prospects for growth in the developing economies china and india after they had been recently very upbeat about prospects there

2894939 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2894940 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2894941 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2894942 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2894943 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency

2894962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2894963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2894964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2894965 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2894966 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2894967 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2894968 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2894969 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2895174 i would be very pleased if senior members of the palestinian authority in our area were to join you on this visit that would afford us the opportunity to create a practical dialogue between neighbors and implement a foundation to co existence and cooperation in daily life independent of any sort of political solution
2895175 i believe that considering your international reputation as prime minister of the united kingdom as the quartets special envoy and as someone that the different groups in our area trust your cooperation with myself and with mayors of palestinian cities in the area such as salfit and nablus in addition to assistance from the third sector can set dramatic regional developments in motion

2895181 rarely does a case get solved by only forensic evidence
2895182 here the science is highly informative but its also limited

2895195 there are many ways to drive cost savings and better value in the face of a tight economy
2895196 we have taken great efforts to simplify standardize and automate our supplier interactions
2895197 we get the work to suppliers through the sourcing application so they can bid effectively and lower their costs we automate transactions and communications so they can lower their costs and have transparency into the process and we have automated the invoicing process so it can lower their costs and they can get paid more effectively
2895198 a customer of choice consistently receives competitive preference for scarce resources across a critical mass of suppliers in its database
2895199 bringing a lot of tools under one umbrella and allowing users to connect to a lot of applications both inside and outside central desktop

2895204 the inmate is required to be stripped naked and checked to find he she is not hiding anything on his her body i think you will agree that this type of strip search is not only humiliating and degrading but is also offensive to a woman who is a devout muslim as is dr siddiqui
2895205 because it is so offensive dr siddiqui is now refusing to undergo this procedure and because she will no longer consent she is now forbidden from having a contact visit with her attorneys
2895206 i write to you on behalf of aafia siddiqui phd a 36 year old muslim woman and pakistani citizen who is in pre trial detention at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn new york dr siddiqui is not allowed by the federal bureau of prisons bop to have contact visits that is she is not allowed to come into physical contact with anyone
2895207 despite this the bop and staff at the mdc are insisting that dr siddiqui endure the humiliation of a so called strip search each and every time one of her lawyers come to visit her for purposes of defending her in the united states district court on criminal charges

2895211 after hearing so many of the positive changes and innovative projects post katrina weve decided enough is enough
2895212 its time to put an end to the negative press in mainstream media we know that the levees broke we know that our city is dysfunctional we know that but do you know about prospect 1 or about the influx of young professionals into new orleans the world needs to know about the new new orleans

2895218 it doesnt matter what you believe the way to heaven is paved with sincerity goodness and belief in god
2895219 on what foundation is such a belief based its not from the bible the koran or any other such book why should i believe it have you heard personally from god
2895220 the 529 college savings plans are the best thing going when saving for your kids college education
2895221 many families dont understand all of the aid and scholarship opportunities that are available
2895222 government money is awarded on a first come first served basis and a lot of scholarships are based on how you fill out that fafsa form
2895223 sixty five percent of people who fill out the fafsa fill it out incorrectly so it gets sent back if applicants dont fix it they may get reduced or no aid
2895224 you should not sacrifice your retirement to pay for your childs education
2895225 although saving enough for a good college education is essential parents dont need to feel ashamed for saving for their retirement its ok for students to attend well reputed less expensive colleges
2895226 children should work and help contribute to their college costs
2895227 show children the value of money and that money is earned teach children about the proper use of money and the value of a dollar
2895228 i really didnt know what to expect going up there
2895229 to get a medal in the olympics im overwhelmed im so pleased
2895230 because we need some privacy we do not want your children to come into our yard or house unless they are invited
2895231 we do not want your children to climb on our fence or use our patio chairs for play since we want to keep our property in good condition
2895232 for i know the plans i have for you this is the lords declaration plans for your welfare not for disaster to give you a future and a hope

2895238 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2895239 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2895240 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2895241 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2895242 we are excited about the opportunity to be a part of midlothian and the surrounding communities

2895244 i dont require hair or nail appointments i actually cut my own hair thats why its all the same length
2895245 i dont like divas and i dont want to be one people have a perception that i might be that way but its not true
2895246 just want assurance that they are in a healthy relationship that they can make it when the storms of life hit them and that they have the skills necessary to do what is healthy
2895247 my pastor never really probed in our relationship to discover how healthy we were emotionally or spiritually or relationally
2895248 that counselor really helped us examine our relationship to make sure we were approaching marriage for healthy reasons
2895249 if youre with someone and trying to decide if your problems should keep you apart or if you should try to work through them then why not get counseling before you get engaged
2895250 once the engagement ring sits on a womans finger the couple generally loses most of its objectivity about the relationship
2895251 couples are a lot more willing to stop and deal with a problem prior to engagement because they havent made that public commitment to friends and family
2895252 we couldnt figure out why we fought so much and still wanted to be together
2895253 we said lets go ahead and do it now because we dont want to get engaged get all excited get everyone else all excited and then break it off
2895254 the counselor was able to help us appreciate where each other was coming from and allow us to respect each other rather than just saying youre wrong
2895255 couples tend to remember how to apply the tools of conflict resolution
2895256 values that are sympathetic to your concerns at the spiritual end of your relationship
2895257 they the therapists have got to spend some time figuring you out just because theyre therapists does not mean they can just meet you and know
2895258 doing everything they couples know to do to ensure that this is going to be a happy relationship

2895264 you dont have to paint a figure to express human feelings
2895265 generally i use few colors mainly i use each color as simply symbolic i guess that black and white which i use most often tend to be protagonists
2895266 this is a good sign for the possible replacement of the other three genes used to reprogram cells
2895267 ips cells hold great potential for future medicine but we must learn how to generate these cells in a manner that is safe for clinical therapies
2895268 this advance in reprogramming is one key step toward that goal
2895269 were not sure if the wnt molecule is doing the same thing as c myc or complementing activity
2895270 but it does increase stem cell growth similar to c myc
2895271 this is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
2895272 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
2895273 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells
2895274 we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate
2895275 couldnt carry out the sale until after his saint laurents death

2895279 i suspect thats because theyre getting used to being around humans
2895280 there are probably bucketfuls of these spiders in your home and its very rare to be bitten
2895281 you shouldnt ignore them but you also shouldnt freak out about them
2895282 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2895283 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2895284 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2895285 i have talked with thaksins private secretary who confirmed thaksin will not return to thailand pracha prasobdee said
2895286 im really excited about our residents having the opportunity to stay in town and shop locally instead of having to drive 75 miles in either direction to shop at similar stores
2895287 with the anticipated increase in our gross receipts tax revenue our city will be able to participate in federal and state programs that require matching local funds and we can beef up the infrastructure for the entire community including improving our roads presence will also spark additional growth by attracting other businesses to expand or locate here
2895288 our customers will be able to find their favorite brands right in their own neighborhood and at the wal mart price
2895289 with todays gas prices being able to shop close to home offers additional savings to our customers
2895290 we will have a variety of locally grown produce including lettuce onions cabbage pumpkins and chilies
2895291 our store will also offer a selection of wines from new mexico
2895292 we realize that financial support to local organizations helps make a real difference in the community
2895293 we are thrilled to provide these grants as part of our grand opening celebration we will continue to play a leadership role in supporting the needs of t or c and neighboring communities
2895294 working for wal mart provides a number of job opportunities and choices for so many people from seniors looking for supplemental income to young people just starting their work experience
2895295 the new wal mart supercenter provides much needed employment opportunities for area residents and creates an infusion of additional payroll dollars into the local economy we expect that presence will also attract other businesses to our community which will create even more job opportunities for our citizens
2895296 having our own wal mart in avon park is a boon to our residents who absent a public transportation system and with ever rising transportation costs will find it much easier to take care of their shopping needs
2895297 working for wal mart provides a number of job opportunities and choices for so many people from seniors looking for supplemental income to young people just starting their work experience
2895298 we realize that financial support to local organizations helps make a real difference in the community
2895299 we are thrilled to provide these grants as part of our grand opening celebration we will continue to play a leadership role in supporting the needs of avon park and neighboring communities
2895300 potsdam is known as the sandstone city and wal mart took special care to make this store blend in beautifully with the rest of our wonderful town
2895301 it will be convenient for our local residents and im sure it will attract shoppers from nearby communities who will not only shop at wal mart but also want to experience all that potsdam has to offer
2895302 we are glad to see wal mart because it is a great boost to the community and especially for the two colleges located in the village
2895303 we cant wait to start providing area residents and college students with all the conveniences of a supercenter in their own town
2895304 several associates are students themselves and understand the challenges of juggling classes work and college life
2895305 in addition to buying everything they need to get back to school
2895306 students can find small appliances and closet organizers to make the most of dorm living they can decorate their rooms with new canopy line of durable affordable furniture and home accessories from our home furnishings department they can outfit an entire apartment
2895307 we realize that financial support to local organizations helps make a real difference in the community
2895308 we are thrilled to provide these grants as part of our grand opening celebration we will continue to play a leadership role in supporting the needs of potsdam and neighboring communities

2895313 about putting google reader in its own single app browser

2895318 the wall shimmered and became transparent the walk in front of the flat was jammed with reporters and photographers
2895319 its only been a month harry give it some time
2895320 im not out here because i like being chatted up by random muggles
2895321 i handled it just fine now how about you buy me a drink
2895322 ron didnt think youd be able to tear yourself away from your riveting afternoon of self pity
2895323 soon its hard to believe that its almost been a year but i hope they understand why i did it
2895324 a couple of weeks i need to consider what im going to do about school
2895325 why not mcgonagall said the school will be open in september and none of us took seventh year
2895326 we all got four n e w t s and you can take the rest of the tests without another day at hogwarts
2895327 i dont know what i want to do with my education i mean what should i be
2895328 im not sure if the ministry is right for me
2895329 you mean youre not sure the ministry is ready for you
2895330 with all the trouble the ministrys been having it could use someone with all your big ideas
2895331 youre very sweet ron but i dont think im inclined to stick my neck under that particular guillotine after what happened to your father
2895332 after all kingsley did to rebuild i thought hed be a shoo in
2895333 he told me there were a lot of people still in the ministry that didnt agree with his ideas on openness with muggles
2895334 a lot of people thought he was too soft on draco malfoy
2895335 i wont stand idly by and let crackshot ruin the last two hundred years of reforms the magical world has made regarding muggles i may not be able to do it from the inside just yet but that doesnt mean i cant do something
2895336 what brings you here didnt you say you were going to be on the casting range
2895337 technically im not allowed inside but kingsley lets me on so i dont feel so useless
2895338 and ive been taking some duelling lessons from him during his off hours
2895339 i think hes trying to get me interested so ill join up
2895340 remind me again why you dont want to fight dark wizards any more
2895341 the same reason im going to be returning the elder wand to dumbledores grave ive had enough trouble in my life without going to look for it
2895342 now i just need to figure out what i do want to do with my life
2895343 theres bound to be something else out there for you harry maybe something not connected with dark wizards
2895344 id better go need to put the bread in the oven
2895345 what you dont think i like it when you attack me with your lips
2895346 i was wondering if youd come to gringotts with me
2895347 its not the getting there that i need you for
2895348 its a request to sort through your property and the oh
2895349 harry i said id go with you but what is it thats got you so
2895350 that was your parents vault on the bottom wasnt it
2895351 i dont care about the money harry the amount was shocking but
2895352 id give it all away if it would bring just one of them back
2895353 i just wanted some company there may be something in there i dont understand something from the wizarding world im not familiar with
2895354 new security procedures have been implemented so that only the blood of the account holder or one of their designees can open the vault door
2895355 there was a green and gold book without a name it seemed wholly unremarkable but harry was drawn to it he pulled it from the shelf
2895356 well keep this for later why dont we look at the swords
2895357 no ive got to do something i should have done a month ago
2895358 id be a lot better if youd let me practice more
2895359 id be open to the idea ron but your idea of practicing is to smother me with your mouth
2895360 theres something i wanted to show you oh whats that youve got there
2895361 i mean its about your family biographies anecdotal stories and pictures
2895362 i knew it would eventually get out but so soon
2895363 its not as if you have anything to worry about harry
2895364 not any more im going to stop the cycle and give the wand back to dumbledore
2895365 dont you realise it doesnt matter if you dont have it once people know who last had the wand they wont care if you ground it into powder theyll hunt you down until youre dead
2895366 i can handle that without the elder wand if i have to
2895367 but im not going to keep it a minute longer than i have to
2895368 they dont have a place to mourn their loved ones so they chose dumbledores tomb
2895369 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2895370 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2895371 der er ikke noget at g re i det her marked der er ingen steder man kan sprede sine investeringer for at beskytte sig og gemmer du penge i madrassen bliver de spist af inflationen
2895372 n r folk oplever tab er de ofte ikke parate til at realisere tabet de st r i en ugunstig situation og tror at det er bedre at beholde investeringen problemet er at man risikerer at blive tvunget til s lge ud til lavere priser p et senere tidspunkt
2895373 why does she say men are all the same she says i have no right to her personal life if i dont support her
2895374 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2895375 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2895376 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2895377 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2895378 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2895379 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2895380 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2895381 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2895382 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2895383 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2895384 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2895385 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2895386 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2895387 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2895388 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2895389 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2895390 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2895391 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2895392 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2895393 i was wondering if either one of you wanted that ability
2895394 oh give that to me id love to be able to do that it seems the sort of thing a man should do oh please oh please oh please let me have that ability id be so great when im working in the garden or naming the animals i could just let it rip id be so cool oh please god let it be me who you give that gift to let me stand and pee oh please
2895395 i am so sorry that i have offended you i have this very rare embarrassing physical handicap that causes me to orgasm every time i sneeze
2895396 when john edwards admitted friday that he lied about his affair with filmmaker rielle hunter a former employee of his campaign he may have ended his public life but he certainly ratified an end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism
2895397 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2895398 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2895399 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2895400 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2895401 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2895402 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2895403 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2895404 theres a very very high level of community concern about crime across the northern territory
2895405 both side of politics should commit to auditing the police force and seeing where our resources are
2895406 we are crappy therefore liberal are crappy so why change as the result will be the same
2895407 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election
2895408 its obvious that the public has quickly become disenchanted with rudd and the labor brand and the coalition must capitalise on that now
2895409 our policy is that we will not commit to any policy we have no significant policies and will not have any significant policies that is our policy
2895410 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2895411 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2895412 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2895413 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2895414 we are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country which is the energy crisis
2895415 we have blunted obamas momentum both nationally and in the key states where were ahead even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year
2895416 the most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage
2895417 thats why george bush won in 2004 they had an intensity gap and we have it now
2895418 people are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior what they tell you in june and july will not necessarily comport well with what they do in november

2895431 it was narrated in the first person from the point of view of the ostensibly jaded cocaine addled sexually voracious 20 year old who was shall we say inspired by lisa
2895432 for me youre a little bit frozen in time a little bit alison poole the 21 year old party girl in that book who runs around new york going to nightclubs doing drugs and abusing credit cards

2895437 most of the guys i know have really high powered jobs and make up for lost time when theyre not in the office the berserk after work club i seem to attract them in a big way all these boys in paul stuart suits with six figure salaries and hellfire on a dimmer switch in their eyes

2895439 i obviously played nicely i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major
2895440 unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short but i guess thats the way things go sometimes i gave it my best
2895441 it was a three man race and padraig came out on top
2895442 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me
2895443 i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
2895444 i think its only a matter of time for sergio

2895463 as soon as i opened the door all i could see were your eyes
2895464 youre in a state of shock look again look past my eyes and look again youre mind is blocking out what is really happened here
2895465 my attitude is if youve got relations with sudanese president omar hassan al bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur
2895466 joey cheek has just got to know that i took the sudanese message for him to the chinese government
2895467 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2895468 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2895469 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2895470 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2895471 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its ok to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not ok
2895472 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2895473 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2895474 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2895475 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2895476 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq

2895480 there is no alternative other than all the 25 political parties represented in the constituent assembly to stand at the same place since the process and the foundation of building a new nepal were in the process of being established
2895481 the federal structure of nepal would best fit the country as we have diverse geography population language economic potentials cultural quality and administrative access under this structure all the ethic groups and languages will be respected
2895482 therefore the provinces should be separated on the basis of language and ethnicity
2895483 be warned this is not your run of the mill mixtape this monster took me over 2 years to make i created all the beats using records ive collected over that time various keyboards plus my asr 10 i then carefully assembled everything so that it flows non stop adding scratches and more melodies as spice some of you may know me for my bpm comfort zone of the typical hip hop type but on this project i bust out of that slow sh t and slamm the tempo meters waaaaay up if youre in a somber mood and want to reflect on life this is not for you but if youre gettin ready to go out or just psyched to be alive bang that meks party mixx
2895484 nepal has earned reputation for progressive community based conservation in its protected area management practice and the government has also recognised several forms of community based conservation within its protected area system

2895488 we do not have a lot of details now and are checking the reports saying more than 12 civilians were killed and 18 more wounded
2895489 it was all about assigning responsibility and accountability to the managers
2895490 we are still the same company marked by the same dell drive and spirit but we are better armed to make important decisions
2895491 to be the most successful computer company in the world at delivering the best customer experience in markets we serve
2895492 hey everybody this is what just happened to and or
2895493 leader cannot be decision averse they have to take the responsibility
2895494 leadership that matters to god is leadership that deals with what is at the heart of god
2895495 if god is passionate about something then he is also responsible for getting it done

2895498 you silver wheel are my troubles and i would gladly have them your beauty and grace shine from within i am your servant and yet cannot be yours
2895499 oh my nwyvre do not say it cannot be i have waited for you knowing you and yet not knowing anything come with me to caer arianrhod live with me love me as you can
2895500 my love it is not time i must make my way in the world yet again this time to teach the lesson of the musical soul i shall teach poetry and stories i have been told of one to come who will be greater than i in these arts i will find you again of that you can be sure when time comes you will know where to look
2895501 liberal content is definitely a factor in the coming demise of the printed media or at least in the newspaper end of it
2895502 ive thrown over 100 innings before but its never been 100 quality innings
2895503 i think we are certainly going to have a severe nursing shortage in hawaii
2895504 were still not going to be able to produce enough nurses to replace and fill the vacancies that will be present in 2020
2895505 where everything is so speeded up they get on the job and think oh my gosh this is so much more than i thought youre walking miles every day doing things you never imagined you would be
2895506 even though most professions are different than what they taught you in school nursing is one of the worst very little of the perfect way they taught you is present on the job
2895507 my license covers that unlicensed personnel not the hospital managers
2895508 i have to be sure they can do what theyre supposed to do and come back to me with a problem many of them are very good at their jobs but its a task they dont understand the implications for the patient as a whole i worry about my license and i worry about my job satisfaction
2895509 its really scary when youre the rn in charge of 10 or even 20 patients and you realize youre on your own everyone is looking to you to make decisions and youre relying on a team of everyone from aides to housekeeping for the information you need and youre so bogged down with paperwork you end up cutting corners and youre doing that with peoples lives theres a point when unless its a calling rather than a job its just not worth it no matter how much they pay you
2895510 i dont think the general public recognizes the independent thought and talent it takes to be a nurse
2895511 nurses have to be physically strong emotionally astute intellectually bright and technologically savvy what other profession requires such a combination of skills
2895512 because the reimbursement really drives the success of the healthcare institution you work for
2895513 if im a patient i want the nurse taking care of me not the computer
2895514 for nurses to survive in these high stress environments they need a very nurturing environment thats supportive
2895515 theres quite a lot of stress because of the low staffing numbers because theyre working short in so many areas the nurses are experiencing burnout
2895516 many want to go into the high profile areas of nursing such as critical care emergency intensive care and surgery very few now want to go into long term care or geriatric nursing
2895517 i think the highest priority is care of our elders because thats whats facing us now an aging population in hawaii im afraid there might not be settings for them in the future to take care of their needs
2895518 we need to look at how to meet the needs of people with not only medical problems but vast and complex social problems and much like the nursing crisis these are issues that need to be addressed by the entire community you see a microcosm of the culture within a hospital or long term care facility
2895519 greater tolerance for a lack of civility more abusive communication and behavior more violence gets translated into the healthcare profession nurses want to be treated more respectfully
2895520 its about empowering nurses to fix the problem nurses need to have a say in how a unit is run how its staffed where supplies are kept when discharges are done even the layout of the buildings
2895521 the nurses came back they flocked from other states to california because do you want to work in a facility where youre taking care of 10 patients or five or six
2895522 that would attract more people to the profession people want respect in their jobs its too bad when patients dont know who is the nurse and who is the nurses aide because were all wearing the same scrubs

2895601 for many years harlow was considered the place to study for journalists this is an extremely exciting time and we are going to reclaim our title as the number one journalism institution in the country
2895602 having phil on board is a big coup for us not only is he one of the most influential figures in the british media but as a harlow graduate himself he is passionate about the course and knows first hand the difference training at harlow can make to someones career
2895603 the appointment of phil hall is extremely good news for the college harlow is renowned for producing some of the biggest names in journalism and having him as a champion should firmly put the development of higher education in harlow on the map
2895604 while i was talking to the police officer on the case she mentioned whether it was possible to put an appeal in polish in the paper for the man to come forward
2895605 unless he did they would only be able to charge the 19 year old with a public order offence not abh i thought it would be a great idea we have a lot of polish workers in trowbridge i had a chat with my editor and news editor and arranged to have the appeal translated for the paper
2895606 the page looked really good and hopefully someone will know the man and get in touch with the police so they can pursue the case against the 19 year old
2895607 and we might have attracted a few more polish readers to the paper too

2895622 on 23 march 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head
2895623 a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended
2895624 the room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
2895625 when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt one is guilty of the murder of subject b
2895626 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus
2895627 further investigation revealed that the son ronald opus had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mothers murder this led him to jump off the ten story building on march 23 only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window

2895722 if i say i am not going to succeed im a loser then thats what i am going to be if we say were kings and we say were queens thats what were going to be it has nothing to do with being arrogant
2895723 never before have so many people been abandoned at once
2895724 it is inconceivable to think about losing 10 000 jobs in the first wave and the estimates run in the 30 000 range as the wave continues
2895725 i lost my daughter i lost my career i lost my home
2895726 i had lost any self respect that i had ever had and i lost my freedom i misplaced myself
2895727 i had tried i dont know how many times to quit drugs before i got arrested
2895728 when you lose everything that i had lost and when you recognize you have fallen so far you are going to consider using drugs until you die or you are going to change i wasnt ready to die
2895729 what we do is prevent more people from going into prison and more people from creating crime on the street
2895730 these were not reductions that he wanted to make but reductions he had to make to be the responsible party
2895731 many of these calls we are getting are from people who have finally reached a point where they want to change their lives
2895732 this program has been the difference between life and death for me
2895733 i really dont know if i would be clean today if i didnt have this help
2895734 ich habe sehr gut auf sandplatz gespielt und nun habe ich ein hartplatz turnier gewonnen das bringt viel selbstvertrauen ich hoffe dass ich so weitermachen kann und auch bei den us open gut spiele wenn ich ein top ten spieler werden m chte muss ich sie auf jedem belag schlagen k nnen und das beginne ich jetzt
2895735 ich habe nicht gro artig aufgeschlagen und habe auch nicht so gut returniert wie in der ganzen woche zuvor das hat einen gro en unterschied ausgemacht

2895739 yo kobe theres no stopping me tonight king of the world
2895740 we have a phenomenal location with great visibility off i 90
2895741 we ran into a problem with a florida hotel over the name
2895742 those decisions and planning are always in a constant state of flux
2895743 we are not daunted we are really excited what an inspirational show
2895744 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2895745 hillary supporters were not only passionate but there were also 18 million of them
2895746 that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2895747 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2895748 sen obama and dr howard dean and nancy pelosi and various other people ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing hillary to be treated the way she was
2895749 theres a platform resolution about discrimination and the media that says that the democratic party will speak up the next time one of their leaders is treated like trash some of us want to correct that problem and move on
2895750 his vice presidential choice will be subject to the hillary clinton test is this person he chose as well or better qualified to be president than she is
2895751 if the person is not thats viewed as a personal affront to clinton ive heard that repeatedly
2895752 i hope that in the next three months those folks will have an awakening in terms of whats at stake in november
2895753 the compensation for the loss of innocence of simplicity of unselfconscious energy is the classic moment its there on record you can play it any time
2895754 the goal is to make sure theres not another family that will go through what we went through
2895755 thats a lot more manpower they can cover a lot of territory
2895756 the way the game is played it puts it closer to election time
2895757 i want to make a statement i want a lot of family members there i want a lot of signatures
2895758 obviously the more money you bring in the more you can do
2895759 gannon and duarte are not ones to stay in five star hotels and eat in five star restaurants they want to stretch the money as far as they can go
2895760 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2895761 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
2895762 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas
2895763 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2895764 on the back of this the bank became concerned as to exactly what was happening with investor sentiment in new zealand
2895765 the bank was very clear that whilst it was prepared to provide capital and additional funding for the business that this was not in any way intended to substitute or underwrite the debenture holders position
2895766 wir leben in zeiten hoher energiepreise da f hrt kein weg zur ck
2895767 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2895768 seluruhnya ada enam gram kurang lebih tapi tidak bagian kepemilikan satu orang bersama sama
2895769 mungkin baru kali ini mengalami seperti ini ditahan di kantor polisi dengan dugaan kasus narkoba
2895770 the compensation for the loss of innocence of simplicity of unselfconscious energy is the classic moment its there on record you can play it any time
2895771 the compensation for the loss of innocence of simplicity of unselfconscious energy is the classic moment its there on record you can play it any time
2895772 all of them wanted me to pay them lots of money and i thought their stupid shopping carts didnt look nice
2895773 i built my little web site and threw some paypal buttons on there
2895774 ill tell people in my columns look this is what you need to do but theyre still going to need the products to do it and thats what they see in those ads
2895775 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2895776 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2895777 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2895778 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2895779 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2895780 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2895781 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2895782 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2895783 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2895784 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2895785 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2895786 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2895787 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2895788 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2895789 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2895790 for me personally it is very difficult to believe in that al qaeda is in the gorge
2895791 because to come from afghanistan to that part of georgia they need to cross at least six or seven countries including the caspian sea no al qaeda influence cant be in the country
2895792 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2895793 well since israel and the us are against chavez putin and ahmadinejad they must be good
2895794 russia needs to realize that the empire is gone austro hungarian empire is not coming back the ottoman empire is not coming back and nor is the soviet empire
2895795 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2895796 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2895797 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
2895798 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2895799 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2895800 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2895801 report to camp at 8 00 to begin your training
2895802 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2895803 its giving them municipalities the ability to raise taxes without taking the grief
2895804 initial eav and current eav can be applied to a single parcel or property within a tif redevelopment area or an aggregate of all property within the tif or a combination of the two

2895839 the corps had a spectacular performance and drew multiple standing ovations
2895840 the kids felt very good about themselves and thats what its all about
2895841 ill have to admit that any one of the top four corps could have won
2895842 we hope to make it interesting intellectual and very emotional
2895843 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2895844 fizemos tudo que t nhamos nos propostos a fazer nos treinos sempre bom ganhar de um placar el stico mas n o podemos nos enganar s vezes vale mais uma vit ria sofrida e trabalhada por 1 a 0 eu prefiro

2895850 im happy that im finishing the season on a good note
2895851 i was feeling ok but i wasnt feeling that great my ankle was killing me and my knee had problems so i had to tape that
2895852 but i started feeling better as the competition went on i went up to 1 68 and we just kept going up by threes until 1 80 my jumps were ok but they werent perfect form until i went to 1 81 where i had a really good jump i had so much clearance it was probably a 1 85 jump so that felt great
2895853 by my last attempt i had everything right but i didnt have enough power in my legs because id been jumping for a bit my butt just skimmed the bar
2895854 but in other ways i was a little apprehensive because its at the end of the season
2895855 since the junior championships on the 24th and 25th of july we have basically not jumped we have done mostly just work to remain supple it would have been nice to get some more jumping in but i didnt want to aggravate any possible injuries

2895858 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2895859 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2895860 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2895861 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2895862 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2895863 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2895864 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2895865 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2895866 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2895867 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2895868 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2895869 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2895870 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

2895887 i wasnt expecting marc to be on the outside of me and there was marcs drivers side door lined up with my front bumper
2895888 his eyes were fairly big and he just leaned over and waited for the crash and i hit him dead centre good thing these are really tough cars

2895892 there is banger racing in england but its not like this this is demolition
2895893 the key to surviving is making tight corners and try not to get hit head on
2895894 i considered it a couple times but i thought id better keep driving instead
2895895 i didnt want to come to a complete stop it was very tempting though whatever car is in the way you smack him we have eight cars on a small course so youre always in contact with somebody so thats good
2895896 i got really good air and bounced my head a few times to shake the cobwebs but i just held on to the wheel tight and ended up going fairly quick
2895897 thank god i made it through the course because i wasnt into running
2895898 that was a great pass from mato pronounced mah tay he puts the ball in the box every time and you get a chance to score
2895899 the weathers tough on us old guys its the middle of august and you dont expect to have to wear long johns and long sleeved shirts out here we needed to give these guys a loss they hadnt lost all year the games have been close
2895900 we had as many chances as they did they were just better at capitalizing
2895901 the odds were against us going this far into the season undefeated
2895902 this does feel good being shorthanded to finally hand nt air their first loss of the year were happy about that
2895903 they play hard and they deserve every win they get and we had a couple of games earlier where we let it slip away to them
2895904 one of the challenges of masters is injuries and weve had more than our fair share and have had a tough time fielding a roster of 11 every game if we get everybody out were as competitive as anybody in the league we were equal to the challenge sunday
2895905 sometimes we have five or six subs and the other team has one
2895906 on a day like today its a bit more of a challenge to build up rhythm when youre out there for five minute shifts and then subbing off we know in the long run the more healthy bodies you have on the field the more it will pay off
2895907 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2895908 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish

2895916 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2895917 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2895918 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2895919 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2895920 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2895921 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2895922 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2895923 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2895924 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2895925 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2895926 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2895927 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2895928 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2895929 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2895930 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2895931 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2895932 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2895933 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2895934 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2895935 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2895936 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2895937 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2895938 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2895939 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2895940 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2895941 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2895942 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2895943 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2895944 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2895945 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2895946 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2895947 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2895948 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2895949 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2895950 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2895951 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2895952 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2895953 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2895954 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2895955 just so you all know we did set a record
2895956 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2895957 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2895958 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2895959 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2895960 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2895961 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2895962 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2895963 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2895964 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2895965 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2895966 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2895967 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2895968 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2895969 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2895970 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2895971 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2895972 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2895973 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2895974 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2895975 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2895976 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2895977 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2895978 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2895979 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2895980 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2895981 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2895982 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2895983 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2895984 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2895985 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2895986 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2895987 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2895988 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2895989 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2895990 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2895991 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2895992 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2895993 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2895994 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2895995 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2895996 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2895997 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2895998 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2895999 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2896000 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2896001 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2896002 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2896003 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2896004 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2896005 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2896006 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2896007 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2896008 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2896009 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2896010 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2896011 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2896012 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2896013 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2896014 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2896015 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2896016 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2896017 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2896018 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2896019 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2896020 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2896021 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2896022 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2896023 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2896024 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2896025 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2896026 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2896027 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2896028 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2896029 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2896030 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2896031 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2896032 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2896033 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2896034 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2896035 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2896036 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2896037 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2896038 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2896039 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2896040 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2896041 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2896042 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2896043 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2896044 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2896045 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2896046 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2896047 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2896048 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2896049 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2896050 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2896051 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2896052 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2896053 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2896054 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2896055 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2896056 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2896057 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2896058 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2896059 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2896060 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2896061 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2896062 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2896063 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2896064 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2896065 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2896066 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2896067 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2896068 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2896069 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2896070 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2896071 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2896072 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2896073 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2896074 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2896075 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2896076 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2896077 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2896078 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2896079 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2896080 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2896081 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2896082 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2896083 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2896084 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2896085 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2896086 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2896087 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2896088 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2896089 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2896090 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2896091 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2896092 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2896093 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2896094 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2896095 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2896096 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2896097 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2896098 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2896099 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2896100 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2896101 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2896102 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2896103 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2896104 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2896105 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2896106 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2896107 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2896108 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2896109 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2896110 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2896111 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2896112 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2896113 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2896114 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2896115 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2896116 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2896117 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2896118 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2896119 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2896120 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2896121 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2896122 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2896123 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2896124 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2896125 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2896126 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2896127 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2896128 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2896129 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2896130 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2896131 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2896132 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2896133 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2896134 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2896135 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2896136 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2896137 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2896138 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2896139 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2896140 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2896141 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2896142 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2896143 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2896144 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2896145 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2896146 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2896147 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2896148 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2896149 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2896150 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2896151 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2896152 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2896153 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2896154 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2896155 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2896156 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2896157 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2896158 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2896159 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2896160 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2896161 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2896162 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2896163 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2896164 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2896165 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2896166 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2896167 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2896168 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2896169 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2896170 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2896171 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2896172 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2896173 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2896174 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2896175 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2896176 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2896177 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2896178 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2896179 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2896180 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2896181 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2896182 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2896183 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2896184 where do you find your inspiration to write what sparks these stories in your mind
2896185 you do such a good job of testifying about your faith how do you know where the fine line is between sharing your faith and beating someone over the head with it
2896186 in calico canyon daniel reeves boys are quite the handful what inspired their behavior have you met boys like them
2896187 the avalanche scene in calico canyon was so intense and realistic how did you write that scene have you experienced anything like that before
2896188 you know because you can compare a corporate franchise like superman a creator owned property like jesse custer whose influence is limited to
2896189 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies
2896190 quick aside wouldnt you love to see american idol open auditions in gotham city paula would be mistaken for the joker
2896191 i love creating work that can be enjoyed by my four year old and my grandfather
2896192 im a firm believer in the joss whedon approach if things are tense and you make a joke its funnier and if youre telling jokes and than something horrible happens its even more horrible i think thats a great way to write stories
2896193 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
2896194 oh sure its a good likeness of her and the fact that captain america and dr strange are playing guitars behind her is chuckle worthy but i think its more entertaining to see c 3po playing drums behind them
2896195 we can complain today about comics with immense splash pages or double spreads and how decompressed storytelling leads to comic books that take five minutes to read and if youre being testy you can partially lay that at the feet of byrnes big double page spreads but to be fair every panel mattered in these early x men and byrnes spreads were not simply to speed up the pace or to take up room but instead provided us with a widescreen panoramic snapshot of the amazing spectacular and uncanny world these trouble four color heroes occupy
2896196 the hospital auxiliary has long been dear to my heart
2896197 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
2896198 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2896199 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2896200 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2896201 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2896202 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2896203 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2896204 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2896205 he should resign because hes doing a lot of damage to the country
2896206 hes not a president who governs for everyone hes just governing for one side and thats bad really bad he should be governing for everyone
2896207 i voted to support this president because he can deliver us a more dignified country
2896208 perhaps my children could live in a more dignified country and not have to live off of handouts they shouldnt have to go abroad to work but should work here
2896209 ill tell you why i support him because hes from the same background has the same blood
2896210 hes implementing a lot of changes the kind of things other presidents havent done the trouble is hes got no time hes been president for a very short time
2896211 is inflation is poverty is investment but when the people voted it did not give them solutions to these problems
2896212 i think maybe the vote will amplify the problems between east and west but i dont think the vote will find solutions to poverty inflation and inequality
2896213 this country has always been divided between rich and poor
2896214 but before the only ones who had a say were the rich however now that the poor the majority are speaking up it appears that the country is divided because for the first time the poor can demonstrate before there was just one voice now there are two voices
2896215 oil and water combination of ambition laziness insecurity certainty and drive
2896216 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2896217 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2896218 doesnt give any of us the right to demand a public appeal for forgiveness
2896219 our marriage had rough patches but weve worked past them
2896220 he made a mistake back in 2006 and we worked things out
2896221 between two people who are honest about commitment to each other
2896222 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2896223 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2896224 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2896225 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2896226 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2896227 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2896228 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2896229 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2896230 reformasi yang diharapkan bisa mengubah keadaan bangsa untuk lebih maju ternyata berlangsung kebablasan karena dilaksanakan seenaknya
2896231 kalau dulu mengritik presiden dilakukan secara hati hati karena dianggap tabu maka sekarang mencaci maki presiden bisa dilakukan dengan semaunya padahal ada nilai bahwa presiden adalah simbol negara yang harus dihormati
2896232 happen on dry roads on clear sunny days to sober drivers
2896233 they didnt look at us i could feel it they were a little bit afraid of us
2896234 those who express deeply held views and those who have hardly if at all thought about an issue
2896235 expanding exploration mining and drilling and the construction of new power plants or more energy conservation and regulation on energy use and prices
2896236 the big change is in method not necessarily objective and whereas ms buckler may have seen the role of communications as a shield i think teneycke and giorno may see communications as a sword so the change essentially means the current gang are just a little more proactive whereas the last gang may have been reactive
2896237 stephen harper has a long and fascinating history of relationships with journalists he was at the centre of a concerted and well organized campaign to leak embarrassing information about preston manning and rick anderson to sympathetic journalists while he was a member of parliament in mannings reform caucus he made media leaks a core element of his campaign to unite the canadian alliance and the progressive conservatives
2896238 we are not going to sit in ottawa waiting to respond to trumped up attacks from liberal mps
2896239 i will let others judge the effectiveness or lack thereof of this approach
2896240 jadi penindakan terhadap kaki lima tak efektif karena tidak menyelasaikan masalah
2896241 metode ini sudah dijalankan dengan memilih surabaya sebagai pilot project diharapkan jakarta akan menjadi target berikutnya

2896243 any change in production would send a powerful signal to markets
2896244 a welcome sign that the senate is recognizing the importance of greater access to drilling in the outer continental shelf as part of a comprehensive u s energy policy
2896245 van gogh would often reuse the canvas of an abandoned painting
2896246 represents a significant advance over the current protocol for imaging buried paint layers and is a welcome new tool for museum scientists
2896247 remains strong and the summer lull does not seem to be very pronounced
2896248 illustrates the transformation undertaken within the group over the last three years
2896249 demand for our main products remained good overall but the unfavorable exchange rate weighed on the evolution in sales
2896250 grew organically by 13 but were reduced by 5 8 due to negative currency effects
2896251 clariant had a solid first half despite an increasingly difficult environment
2896252 we were able to compensate for an unprecedented 11 hike in raw material costs with price increases and to improve our operating margin
2896253 we expect an even more difficult environment marked by an unbroken trend of raw material cost increases a weakening macroeconomic environment and unfavorable foreign exchange rates
2896254 the perseids is one of the best known meteor showers and for good reason
2896255 you can expect to see up to one meteor per minute around the peak of this shower
2896256 such meteors are often called shooting stars but in reality meteors are not connected with stars at all
2896257 in fact they are tiny pieces of debris often no bigger than a grain of sand which hit our atmosphere at very high speed and instantly vaporise
2896258 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2896259 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2896260 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2896261 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2896262 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2896263 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2896264 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2896265 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2896276 he should resign because hes doing a lot of damage to the country
2896277 hes not a president who governs for everyone hes just governing for one side and thats bad really bad he should be governing for everyone
2896278 i voted to support this president because he can deliver us a more dignified country
2896279 perhaps my children could live in a more dignified country and not have to live off of handouts they shouldnt have to go abroad to work but should work here
2896280 ill tell you why i support him because hes from the same background has the same blood
2896281 hes implementing a lot of changes the kind of things other presidents havent done the trouble is hes got no time hes been president for a very short time
2896282 is inflation is poverty is investment but when the people voted it did not give them solutions to these problems
2896283 i think maybe the vote will amplify the problems between east and west but i dont think the vote will find solutions to poverty inflation and inequality
2896284 this country has always been divided between rich and poor
2896285 but before the only ones who had a say were the rich however now that the poor the majority are speaking up it appears that the country is divided because for the first time the poor can demonstrate before there was just one voice now there are two voices
2896286 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
2896287 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
2896288 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
2896289 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
2896290 its an honor to stand in solidarity with our chinese brothers and sisters who risk their lives every day for expressing the simple act of worshipping their god
2896291 they routinely deal with the tragic and painful loss of children through forced abortion and young girls face the horror of being sold into sex slavery through human trafficking my hope is through my witness today i may be a voice for them
2896292 we pray that god will bring an end to these human rights abuses by the chinese government and one day the world will see justice liberty and freedom for the beautiful people of this wonderful country

2896327 as democrats with a great respect for national interests all political parties that took part in the election should accept the election outcome
2896328 sam rainsy and his people cry like this every time after an election but his cries cannot defeat the law
2896329 the cpp received 90 seats because the people sincerely supported and voted for the cpp as they found that only the cpp can lead the country and that the srp is not reliable
2896330 if we join the meeting it means that we recognize the election outcome thus we will not join the meeting
2896331 cannot accept the election outcome if our lawsuits are not resolved and we will not attend the na session but we will not abandon our seats in the na
2896332 first the srp want to join the government but the cpp does not want them second the srp wants to share the positions of na commission chairmen or vice chairmen with the cpp

2896373 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing

2896378 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2896379 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar
2896380 the rba appears to be turning more concerned about the prospects for growth in the developing economies china and india after they had been recently very upbeat about prospects there
2896381 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2896382 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2896383 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2896384 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2896385 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2896386 i dont care what i do as long as its with you
2896387 ah come on you guys smile it will only hurt for an hour

2896401 mama your baby boy has lost more weight almost a full pound now would you like for me to give him a little formula just a few drops or do you want to wait for the pediatricians advice in the morning
2896402 yes please give benjamin some formula i know the pediatrician is going to advise me to supplement after yesterdays conversation
2896403 once your baby is given a bottle or formula he is less likely to breastfeed and
2896404 theres nothing wrong with giving your baby formula your milk will likely arrive soon it usually takes a few days after delivery for mature milk to come in in the meantime get some rest life will be much harder once you get home by the way i fed my four babies with formula and they all turned out just fine my twins are on their way to college both with scholarships youd be surprised by how many women cant breastfeed or decide not to breastfeed exclusively or dont breastfeed at all it doesnt mean theyre bad mothers its a very personal issue and you will know whats right for you and your baby
2896405 im just not sure if the baby is getting anything from me ben has lost too much weight and i have been advised to supplement with formula

2896427 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
2896428 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2896429 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2896430 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2896431 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2896432 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2896433 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2896434 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2896435 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2896436 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2896437 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2896438 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2896439 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2896440 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2896441 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2896442 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2896443 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2896444 technology is drive of products service is source of market

2896448 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2896449 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2896450 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2896451 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2896452 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2896453 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2896454 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2896455 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2896456 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2896457 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2896458 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2896459 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2896460 it was a sip of wine and wear a wig for one crap song i hate not to be grateful but i expected dinner or costumes
2896461 so weve got two people with no hair for that
2896462 hey r her elder bro check this amitabh in swimming trunks hahaha and hes wearing even those as high as his pants
2896463 ma er didnt that woman whats her name zeenat aman have short hair a scene ago
2896464 huh you mean they wanted us to believe she grew it overnight
2896465 ew thats just an old man trying to be young
2896466 if not im going to have to start looking for other options
2896467 if lou decides to put me on the bench then thats where i will be im not going to start hitting just because he said something like that either so ill just follow whatever lou tells me to do
2896468 the first double play today was a hit and run and we didnt execute the play that double play certainly wasnt his fault he moved the runner over when we needed it in the sixth he hit that ball hard last time up he does such a good job in right field that we hate to take him out of the lineup because of that but at the same time weve got other people here that are looking for some playing time that are swinging the bat im going to give him every opportunity but wed like to see him hit
2896469 maybe thats the american way of doing things around here
2896470 he hasnt seen me when im really hitting good he hasnt seen me when im really hitting bad gerald has not seen everything that he needs to see to give the best advice
2896471 i just look at trying to put lineups that produce runs
2896472 weve got a couple of guys here that are swinging the bats sooner or later ive got to give them opportunities
2896473 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2896474 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2896475 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2896476 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2896477 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
2896478 la suppression de la pub fait partie dun plan global
2896479 la suppression de la pub fait partie dun plan global
2896480 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2896481 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2896482 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2896483 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2896484 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2896489 kein staat hat das recht das staatsgebiet eines anderen staates mit milit rischen mitteln zu verletzen nur weil einige b rger dort p sse des intervenierenden staates besitzen
2896490 jedes mal wenn sich in europa ein staat dieses recht herausgenommen hat f hrte das zu einem krieg und wir haben die pflicht uns daran zu erinnern wie sich adolf hitler vor etwas mehr als einem halben jahrhundert dieses recht herausgenommen hat um weite teile mitteleuropas anzugreifen

2896493 for those that remain i contacted neel shah of miracle connect a few days ago and informed him that i had contacted my attorney general and was preparing to call the nypd despite having sent multiple emails over the last few months i very suddenly received a refund via paypal and an email from shah alluding to some unfortunate personal circumstances ok shit happens but still anyway if you do not receive a refund promptly let me know and ill be able to provide all contact information for the gentlemen involved in miracle connect dont bother with the better business bureau or paypal call your state attorney general and the nypd both have divisions specifically designed to handle this geez i sound like dwight from the office
2896494 also if you get your money back make sure you ask for money back fees applied by paypal whatever those are i didnt and i lost 3 thats about half a pound of rainer cherries which are not as good im sure as miracle berries but you can at least buy them three weeks out of the year
2896495 i felt the same frustration and after e mailing neel multiple times and finally threatening to take legal action he told me his mother had passed away and i had the tablets hand delivered to my apartment the next day i havent tried them yet though so who knows
2896496 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners
2896497 its an action ensemble comedy in the vein of oceans eleven where the casting becomes an event
2896498 it is a bunch of these terrific actors getting together and having a good time its that kind of thing
2896499 desde fines de la d cada de 1970 momento en que comenz a aplicarse la pol tica de reforma y apertura el gobierno municipal de yiwu ha llevado activamente a la pr ctica la estrategia de desarrollar la ciudad mediante el fomento del comercio y la promoci n de un desarrollo socioecon mico r pido y multifac tico regulado por el mercado hace 20 a os los yiwuneses empezamos a hacer pruebas para convertir nuestra ciudad en uno de los principales centros nacionales de peque os productos en china esas iniciativas experimentales desempe aron un papel decisivo en el despegue econ mico de yiwu cuya situaci n geogr fica es ciertamente ventajosa adem s de encontrarse en el centro de la provincia de zhejiang est rodeada de ciudades que son importantes centros de las industrias ligera y textil decididos a aprovechar esa ventaja en 1982 los habitantes de yiwu organizamos la feria nacional de peque os productos la primera y la mayor de su g nero en la china de aquel entonces poco a poco el comercio de peque os productos fue convirti ndose en el pilar de la econom a local y en el emblema del municipio de yiwu
2896500 la mayor a de nuestros productos se exportan principalmente a los pa ses rabes los ee uu y am rica latina la verdad es que la venta minorista a los comerciantes nacionales es muy reducida la raz n es muy simple la venta de l mparas decorativas en los mercados extranjeros reporta ganancias decenas de veces superiores a las que obtenemos vendi ndolas en el interior de china no puedo darle datos sobre nuestras exportaciones ya que es un secreto comercial pero s puedo asegurarle que son muy elevadas y rentables
2896501 en solo un mes exportamos veinte o treinta contenedores de zapatos casi todos se exportan a oriente medio y frica con la venta de un par de zapatos las ganancias brutas son muy reducidas en cambio los contratos de venta al por mayor que firmamos con los empresarios extranjeros ascienden a decenas de miles yuanes
2896502 me siento muy bien aqu y me gusta la ciudad en yiwu china podemos comprar f cilmente todo tipo de mercanc as por ejemplo la compra de productos transportados por contenedores y compra de muestras de peque o volumen los comerciantes de yiwu son muy eficaces e inteligentes y tengo muy buena experiencia con ellos
2896503 muchos de mis amigos y compa eros conocen la ciudad de yiwu y tienen muy buena impresi n sobre la calidad y variedad de las mercanc as que se encuentran aqu china est experimentando un r pido crecimiento y muchos comerciantes extranjeros incluy ndome a m encontramos innumerables oportunidades que uno no puede dejar pasar
2896504 aqu se ven muchas mercanc as interesantes deseo comprar muchas cosas pero claro tengo que fijarme en los precios
2896505 es un gran centro comercial con una administraci n avanzada nos ofrece muchas facilidades y servicios completos tales como la instalaci n de los tel fonos y el acceso al internet todo esto nos permite estar al corriente de las informaciones m s recientes sobre el mercado y la demanda asimismo tambi n podemos encontrar restaurantes de comida coreana y comer los t picos platos de nuestro pa s
2896506 ahora yiwu ha devenido en la mayor base de producci n de joyas de la parte continental por lo que los precios de yiwu determinan los precios al por menor de mi negocio
2896507 vi trodde att det skulle g bra men inte s h r bra

2896509 what a race today we made some modifications to our bike after warm up and these gave us the last few tenths that enabled me to fight with casey today the result was just fantastic i got a good start and i was able to pass him in the first lap but i knew i had to try and stay in front of him and it was impossible to relax even for one second my m1 was brilliant and so were my bridgestone tyres i really only made one mistake at the corkscrew when i went a bit wide but in fact the dirt had quite good grip also casey was a bit faster on the straight than me but i was stronger on the brakes so i had to make all my passes there i dont know how many times we changed the lead but it was a lot and it was great great racing for me and i think also for the fans because its been a while since weve been like this to stay in front i had to do high 21s at least on every lap and i want to thank my team and engineers for giving me a bike that could do this i had a great rhythm and i am really so happy to win for the first time in america about the passes i am sorry that casey thinks some of them were a bit strong but i really dont agree i passed only on the brakes i braked in the same places every time and we never touched of course this was an aggressive race but it was definitely a fair one now we have the summer break and i am looking forward to relaxing a bit but not too much because its going to be a hard fight for the final seven races and we must keep the concentration
2896510 i truly believe that srivijaya was that brilliant light that stayed bright from nearly a millennium malacca was a just spark though brilliant as it may be
2896511 on the morning of friday june 8 110 buses pulled up at the border site of nong chan a few miles north of aranyaprathet where several thousand refugees were now camped in fields thai soldiers in the buses told the refugees they were being moved to another better camp some refugees seemed to believe what they were told and were happy enough to leave the squalid overcrowded conditions of nong chan others were not one woman who had walked out of cambodia to nong chan with her three children only a week before said later that she was terrified when the thai soldiers began to herd them into buses
2896512 each person murmuring angrily or fighting back tears tried to come to grips with catastrophe in his own way shocked disbelief showed on every face we had just come from hell and were being sentenced to return we couldnt believe our awful fate defeated many wished only for a quick death
2896513 cruel as it was we could understand the lie but it was doubly cruel to push us back across in the north when arrangements had been made for returning us to the south it seemed little short of cold blooded premeditated murder the remote jungle had been chosen deliberately the thais wanted an international incident and we were to be it
2896514 loaded with cambodian refugees from temporary camp sites all over eastern thailand hundreds of buses converged on a mountainous region of the northeastern border near the temple of preah vihear whose ownership had long been a source of bitter dispute between thailand and cambodia
2896515 the path down the mountains became steeper the jungle thicker dozens scores of people fell onto mines those with possessions had to abandon them to carry their children down
2896516 below the ridge we could hear people screaming and moaning those who had been forced over the border during the past two days stubbornly refused to move off the mountainside trails yet the press of refugees from above kept pushing them farther down the entire face of the hill had been heavily mined by the khmer rouge four years ago and everyone was terrified to break a new trail in the five mile wide occasionally a mine exploded as the crowd pushed someone off the trail since everyone wanted to step only where they had seen others step they slid cautiously downward only when forced from above by the pressure of others moving downhill descent proceeded at a snails pace
2896517 one group of refugees desperately pooled whatever valuable they had left filled two buckets with them and walked back up toward the thai soldiers carrying a white flag the soldiers took the buckets and then opened fire on the refugees
2896518 the chinese gentleman and his party had pooled their thai money in a red plastic bucket quietly he offered it to the soldier then asked to be pointed in a direction leading to freedom the soldier accepted the bucket and motioned with his gun down a side path as he looked the other way no sooner had the group started down this path however than the guard turned and raised the muzzle of his submachine gun they fell like dominoes
2896519 i thought the nightmare i had lived through for years and the trauma of our escape had exposed me to all the suffering and horrors this world had to offer i was wrong nothing had prepared us for this first night on the trail descent from the cliff was like being lowered into the jaws of hell

2896523 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2896524 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals

2896535 of course we really wont know until he puts the pads on and we see him do it in a game
2896536 owen is doing exactly what we brought him in here to do which is move people
2896537 i was with him in the senior bowl so i knew all along that he had it in him owen was really explosive with his blocks friday night and it was good to see
2896538 owen doesnt just get people out of the hole he gets his feet out of the hole so the back can run through there
2896539 i couldnt really show in the spring minicamps what im all about because we didnt have pads on
2896540 but i feel i gave them somewhat of a good explanation of what i am in this game
2896541 own just smacked the heck out of the defensive back at the end of it
2896542 instead of dancing around and trying to be a halfback he ran like a fullback and really took it to the guy
2896543 he didnt just block the linebacker he cleared him out so well that he gave me two ways to go not just one
2896544 to get the ball is always fun but obviously blocking is where im at there were some good things but there were a lot of bad things and a lot of things i need to work on
2896545 when two guys that are 600 pounds combined are coming at you youre going to win some but youre going lose some too
2896546 i cant wait to get out there and hopefully show them what im all about

2896575 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
2896576 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
2896577 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis
2896578 but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts cancer specialists and gps can provide treatment with the help of psychiatrists if necessary

2896587 hes got two arms two legs just like a lot of our kids when you see that you want to be there too

2896661 the state of georgia now has returned to a more normal climate pattern with greater year to year variability
2896662 drought is part of the overall history of the southeast but the history also contains long periods of wetter weather
2896663 we will have more years that are extremely wet and more years that are extremely dry which historically is the more common pattern
2896664 if you look back at droughts the 1960s and 1970s were the abnormal years there was very little variation
2896665 if it does get warmer as atmospheric scientists say it will well see lower lake levels over time
2896666 so just because theyre going up now after a season of rain and snow doesnt mean theyll stay that way
2896667 and it certainly doesnt mean that climate change isnt real

2896729 bioport just tested its final lot of ava anthrax vaccine in a potency test if it doesnt pass there are no more lots to test and the program will come to a halt thats bad for everyone concerned including us im sure that blame will be spread around

2896740 saya sangat mendukung penyelenggaraan festival ini kegiatan init ini lahir dari masyarakat sanur dan menjadi bukti keberhasilan masyarakat dalam membangun sektor pariwisata

2896742 saya belum tahu pasti jumlah pengunjung namun target 20 000 orang tampaknya terlewati hal ini terbukti selalu ramainya jumlah pengunjung dari tiap event yang digelar festival kuliner selalu dibanjiri penonton apalagi kalau malam sangat penuh dengan pengunjung
2896743 i know thats what you do i guess i just dont have the stomach for it
2896744 if i lose the light of the sun i will write by candlelight moonlight no light if i lose paper and ink i will write in blood on forgotten walls i will write always i will capture nights all over the world and bring them to you
2896745 the average is the borderline that keeps mere men in their place
2896746 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2896747 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2896748 ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2896749 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2896750 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2896751 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2896752 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2896753 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion

2896755 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2896756 the market is clearly in transition and we will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to aggressively move into market adjacencies
2896757 we believe we are entering the next phase of the internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by networked web 2 0 technologies
2896758 we have project teams working on a global basis and to help them collaborate effectively we use google apps
2896759 the spectacular growth of sharepoint is the result of the great combination of collaboration and information management capabilities it delivers
2896760 i believe that the success weve seen so far is just the beginning for sharepoint
2896761 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2896762 working together and with the best data we can manage this problem
2896763 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
2896764 cities compete in the market for business investment talent all sorts of things and finding ways to profit by tackling climate change can make them attractive
2896765 the laptop computer is a wonderful invention i prefer working on laptops at any time and mine are mostly used as desktop substitute machines but road trips make you even more profoundly appreciate the genius of the laptop
2896766 can i understand there will be no delisting on today the 11th
2896767 this case is yet another step we are taking to help the noreve brand become one of the most unique and recognized case manufacturers in the world
2896768 we look forward to working with additional types of precious stones in our future designs
2896769 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2896770 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2896771 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2896772 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2896773 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2896774 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2896775 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2896776 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2896779 the child alone a poet is spring and fairyland are his truth and reason show but dim and alls poetry with him rhyme and music flow in plenty for the lad of one and twenty but spring for him is no more now than daisies to a munching cow just a cheery pleasant season daisy buds to live at ease on hes forgotten how he smiled and shrieked at snowdrops when a child or wept one evening secretly for aprils glorious misery wisdom made him old and wary banishing the lords of faery wisdom made a breach and battered babylon to bits she scattered to the hedges and ditches all our nursery gnomes and witches lob and puck poor frantic elves drag their treasures from the shelves jack the gone mother goose and oberon bluebeard and king solomon robin and red riding hood take together to the wood and sir galahad lies hid in a cave with captain kidd none of all the magic hosts none remain but a few ghosts of timorous heart to linger on weeping for lost babylon
2896780 menos mal que pude meter el gol hoy es el d a del ni o y tom s me lo hab a pedido por tel fono as que va para l y s tambi n fue un desahogo en lo personal
2896781 no estaba haciendo las cosas bien y eso me molesta siempre me exijo y quiero hacer lo mejor para el equipo por eso estoy muy feliz por haber marcado este tanto me da mayor confianza para lo que viene
2896782 pocho no est jugando en su mejor nivel pero tiene toda mi confianza porque se trata de un futbolista importante y de categor a capaz de definir un partido con una aparici n hoy fue el caso
2896783 fue una jugada r pida con varios pases de primera eso descoloc a los defensores yo me ubiqu por el segundo palo y defin de primera con la pierna derecha fue importante porque sirvi para clasificar y ganar confianza de a poquito y por momentos el equipo va jugando bien
2896784 obligar al contrario a hacer faltas es una t ctica que hoy ha funcionado
2896785 al principio tuvimos algunas dificultades con las coreanas tienen un equipo estupendo controlan bien el bal n y saben atacar en la segunda mitad se mostraron un poco m s agresivas
2896786 mis jugadoras tienen que mantener la concentraci n hasta el pitido final dos de las defensas no prestaron atenci n a la jugada el gol coreano no tendr a que haber subido al marcador
2896787 han visto ustedes el dispositivo defensivo que corea hab a preparado hoy para contrarrestar a marta
2896788 ah se puede ver lo buena que es no creo que ella haya visto nunca una defensa semejante esperamos mucho de ella pero las mediocampistas sencillamente tienen que apoyar m s
2896789 you had a perfectly beautiful summer day that turned into a 50 mph wind gust
2896790 the 99 things you do right are meaningless when that one thing goes wrong
2896791 the landlord gave him the benefit of the doubt but the next time he saw the defendant lucas told him he was in fact a firearms officer
2896792 in an interview he accepted that he had lied in the tenancy agreement
2896793 this is rather an unusual offence it must be said and mr lucas didnt actually get very far
2896794 he attempted to secure accommodation and nothing more than that there is no suggestion that he persuaded anyone he was acting in the duty of a police officer and in terms of financial gain nothing was made
2896795 he is remorseful particularly to his girlfriend to whom he had lied in order to impress her
2896796 i can see this clash of philosophies as pretty intense
2896797 coach pellerud wants me to go out and chase down players get stuck into tackles and to be generally aggressive in the middle of the park
2896798 so to me the chant kind of sounded like they were saying canada canada so we took heart from it
2896799 but i never really have been much of a scorer
2896800 were just going to get in their faces like we did with the chinese and try to disrupt their game by playing our hard style and putting them under pressure
2896801 for sure it is going to be a collision of our tactical game and their physical game
2896802 we just need to keep the ball on the ground and move it around and use our style to keep them chasing the ball around
2896803 we started a little slowly but we just need to keep doing what were doing
2896804 we werent patient enough in possession in the first two games but i think we have recognised the problems and we can play our game on tuesday
2896805 toby was an amazing person he was my son and he will never be coming back
2896806 he had had asthma since he was young but his death has come as a complete shock he had attacks in may and he said it was getting worse but we didnt expect this
2896807 a lot of people arent aware of how dangerous asthma is until a tragedy like this happens
2896808 it will never be the same for his two brothers toby was their rock he was a man who touched so many people
2896809 he had recently completed a work placement with a company in central london and they had already offered him a job he was very talented mature beyond his years and able to communicate with people of all ages
2896810 he was quietly ambitious he knew exactly what he wanted but he was also kind as well as being a normal fun loving boy growing up
2896811 it is the first time in the history of indian theatre that the tickets for a play will be made available online
2896812 it is being done on an experimental basis and only a few tickets will be sold online
2896813 one has to log on to the site which has the information on dates and times the buyer can choose a ticket from a chart of seats displayed on a website payments can be made by credit card a computer printout will serve as a ticket at the theatre
2896814 the idea is to help customers save time they can buy tickets at home or at a cyber caf instead of travelling all the way to the theatre
2896815 olakh na palakh is a comedy thriller i have done comedy earlier but a comedy thriller is a first for me suresh jayram has written the script and mangesh kadam is directing the play
2896816 de auto draaide de fort ii straat in en sleurde de motorrijder gewoon mee
2896817 hoe het juist is gebeurd weet ik niet ik kwam met de fiets uit de andere richting gereden maar de motor had zijn grote lichten aan en verblindde me
2896818 plots werd die motor geschept ik zag een regen van vonken en brokstukken die in het rond vlogen dan zag ik de auto een bmw 318 een wat te ruime bocht naar de fort ii straat nemen
2896819 when we walked onto the court there was an unbelievable explosion of noise and it went the whole time from start to finish
2896820 of course i saw a gap between us and the usa
2896821 do you think the usa team was showing off a bit too much about because trying to show the numbers of circus
2896822 we took it hard to the basket because china has three 7 footers
2896823 but ill be happy to tell them you think they have super egos
2896824 it will be a treasure of my memory of my life

2896832 it was hard not to detect at least here in the bay area the sense of disappointment in our state after the subsequent primary results to be out progressived by alabama maryland and north dakota painful
2896833 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
2896834 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
2896835 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
2896836 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
2896837 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2896838 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
2896839 the rupee is stronger mainly on lower oil and gains in local shares but there is strong support for the dollar at 41 90 which should hold the rupee in a range of 41 90 to 42 10
2896840 however if the rupee breaks 41 90 then we may see it rising to 41 75 41 65
2896841 we hopen mensen aan te treffen die nieuwsgierig zijn naar wat wij de afgelopen twee jaar hebben uitgevoerd die gaan we verrassen met een paar nieuwe nummers en de hits natuurlijk op zon groot festival mogen die niet ontbreken

2896843 we hebben samen met damon albarn van blur een project met afrikaanse muzikanten gedaan maar het is onzin om te veronderstellen dat we in onze graceland fase zijn de periode waarin paul simon de afrikaanse muziek omarmde we maken nu een logisch vervolg op onze eerdere muziek hooguit is het ritme wat trager geworden
2896844 ons debuutalbum hebben we in de eerste twee jaar van ons bestaan gemaakt voor een veeleisende band als de onze is het gevaarlijk om in routine te vervallen bovendien we hebben andere interesses naast de muziek
2896845 ik hou van de grove lijnen die je krijgt als je een foto op de kopieermachine legt
2896846 muziek kun je op dezelfde manier beperken tot de meer elementaire bestanddelen wij gebruiken wel een synthesizer maar het is een analoog apparaat dat echt wordt bespeeld zonder voorgeprogrammeerde sequencer partijen die eindeloos doorgaan in dat opzicht zijn we een punkband elke noot elk geluid maken we voor de ogen van het publiek zelf

2896911 hij heeft opnieuw gegokt en gedacht dat hij gemakkelijk van de zuid ossetische separatisten zou winnen maar zie eens wat ervan komt het hele land wordt nu door de russen gebombardeerd
2896912 die jongens weten niet wat oorlog is ze kunnen amper met een geweer omgaan
2896913 anderhalve week geleden zijn er zware grensgevechten tussen georgi rs en zuid osseti rs geweest
2896914 beide partijen wilden de buitenwereld laten zien hoezeer ze hadden geleden toen de russische media uitvoerig toonden hoe zwaar zuid osseti was gebombardeerd voelde georgi zich achtergesteld en nodigde vervolgens westerse diplomaten en journalisten uit om te komen kijken hoe erg zijn grondgebied was verwoest
2896915 nu hadden ze er echter geen bezwaar meer tegen dat ook de russische ambassadeur in tbilisi popov aan de besprekingen deelnam maar toen popov een overeenkomst in de maak had met de georgische minister van integratie kwamen de zuid osseti rs niet opdagen
2896916 drie dagen daarvoor waren de georgi rs al begonnen met een enorme troepenopbouw aan de grens
2896917 die donderdag werd er weliswaar nog steeds over en weer geschoten maar het was met lichte wapens s avonds kondigde saakasjvili een staakt het vuren af en die nacht is het misgegaan wat wil je met zoveel militairen en wapens aan de grens heb je in de duisternis maar een vonkje nodig om de boel te laten exploderen
2896918 al hun zware artillerie en raketten die ze de afgelopen jaren van de amerikanen en anderen hebben gekocht zijn ingezet
2896919 terwijl die wapens helemaal niet bedoeld zijn voor een oorlog voor een relatief ingewikkelde geografische situatie als rond tschinvali juist daardoor zijn er heel veel slachtoffers aan zuid ossetische zijde gevallen onze lokale staf in tschinvali hebben we op een gegeven moment teruggeroepen zo gevaarlijk was de situatie
2896920 als russische vredestroepen worden bedreigd laat moskou ze niet in de steek
2896921 maar vanwege de ligging van zuid osseti kunnen de russen alleen snel reageren door vliegtuigen in te zetten om die vredestroepen te beschermen dit scenario was altijd al onze grote angst
2896922 daarna trokken de georgische tanks en infanterie tschinvali binnen die zich vervolgens weer moesten terugtrekken bij die aanval zijn opnieuw veel doden en gewonden gevallen volgens onze informatie
2896923 ze zijn veel beter uitgerust en getraind dan twee jaar geleden ook hebben velen ervaring als vredeshandhaver in kosovo en irak maar voor een militaire operatie als die in zuid osseti zijn toch andere vaardigheden vereist want het is daar ingewikkeld terrein en nu al lijkt het er op dat ze niet in hun opzet geslaagd zijn
2896924 het is nu al duidelijk dat de militaire operatie van saakasjvili in zuid osseti is mislukt in plaats van tegenover de zuid ossetische separatisten staat georgi straks aan die grens tegenover russische troepen en dat is een nachtmerriescenario
2896925 het is nu onze belangrijkste taak om de russische en georgische troepen uit elkaar te houden want een openlijke confrontatie kan fataal zijn ook kunnen de huidige ontwikkelingen weleens de politieke dood van saakasjvili betekenen en dat is precies wat moskou wil als je te ver gaat zoals saakasjvili heeft gedaan is de kans nu eenmaal groot dat je alles verliest

2896927 we schrijven allemaal nummers en die worden vervolgens door de hele band onder handen genomen we overleggen ruzi n en spelen tot ze hun definitieve vorm hebben
2896928 we geven elkaar tevoren alleen een omschrijving zoals het moet klinken als een marokkaanse tiener die black sabbath nadoet

2896930 we hebben voor onze concerten zo veel apparatuur nodig dat we het niet meer kunnen meenemen in het vliegtuig die huurt onze tourmanager ter plaatse voor ieder optreden
2896931 als we reizen ben ik behangen met mijn gitaren keyboards een synthesizer en mijn effectpedalen
2896932 terwijl ik drum bedien ik met mijn voeten pedalen die in verbinding staan met pads op die pads staat een verzameling van onze samples die ik op ieder gewenst moment kan laten horen ook onze bassist bedient met zijn voeten een aantal pedalen al die voorgeprogrammeerde geluiden staan opgeslagen op pads en harddiscs die we met ons meeslepen
2896933 we zaten vijf dagen in de studio de nabewerking duurde ruim vier maanden
2896934 uren waren we bezig met de snaredrum om hem te laten klinken als whooshh
2896935 en uren aan de klank van de aanslag van een pianotoets
2896936 je hebt mensen die een beter resultaat toeschrijven aan kastjes en mensen die de software versie beter vinden de technicus met wie we aan het eind van het opnameproces werkten zwoer bij effectkastjes in plaats van software hij was kwaad dat we het in de computer hadden gedaan hij wilde dat we alles opnieuw deden
2896937 soms maar het verschil zit hem vooral in de rijkdom aan mogelijkheden die in de computer werken geeft
2896938 met digitale hulpmiddelen kun je nauwkeurig knippen en plakken als je een bepaald effect wil gebruiken kun je heel precies doseren hoelang en waar
2896939 dat betekent dat onze muziek voor een groot deel op een visuele manier ontstaat vroeger werkte je met tape en deed je alles op het gehoor door die visuele relatie met je muziek hoor je het soms niet goed omdat je steeds naar het scherm zit te kijken

2896955 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
2896956 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy online casino stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
2896957 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
2896958 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
2896959 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase online casino items but choose to do offline
2896960 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
2896961 because weve noted a huge demand for online casino transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for online casino companies and many others
2896962 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
2896963 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a online casino product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
2896964 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
2896965 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price

2896985 to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
2896986 i actually struggle with things that are comfortable its something that i work with with sports psychologist bob rotella im better off i definitely have a little bit of i want to be fighting it
2896987 and thats why i have done well when things like this week when im not quite on my game ive won many a tournament where i felt i wasnt swinging as well as i could and performed poorly sometimes when i felt i was swinging well
2896988 so im a bit a little bit of a contrast like that but im getting better as i said at the open championship i did it when i felt good about my game and that was important to me
2896989 its a fascinating thing this week that i definitely didnt have my golf swing
2896990 my co ordination was out all week on thursday and friday i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough my game was going downhill very quickly out on the golf course
2896991 when i went back and had a look at it and had a discussion with my trainer at home it was possible that i was dehydrated and thats what caused the lack of co ordination
2896992 so it gave me something to focus on i focused on friday evening and saturday and all through saturday and sunday in rehydrating myself and at least whether that was the cause or not whether it was it might have been tiredness as well

2897017 we have project teams working on a global basis and to help them collaborate effectively we use google apps
2897018 the spectacular growth of sharepoint is the result of the great combination of collaboration and information management capabilities it delivers
2897019 i believe that the success weve seen so far is just the beginning for sharepoint

2897227 people were probably saying to themselves here is memphis the buckle on the bible belt and isaac hayes is coming out onstage dressed as black moses
2897228 if you notice that album opened out with flaps kind of like a crucifix that was seen as pretty heavy for those times and that was the mystique about him wearing those chains
2897229 the first few shows i did with him he didnt wear the chains
2897230 but then he started wearing them and i think it represented to him the coming freedom of the black man
2897231 his music represented an identity of what it meant to be black
2897232 it was exciting in a kind of strength of course it all coincided with the civil rights movement and for a musician his was a different image coming out there onstage with no shirt and those chains man it was a whole other world
2897233 i remember we had been on the road and he came offstage and people were howling and grabbing for him and one of the musicians said man you are the black moses people will follow you anywhere it was really radical
2897234 so everything you hear on his albums he had hummed to himself first
2897235 i felt like i should treasure everything that i have because you never know

2897282 the targets of these vicious and cowardly attacks were innocent iraqi men women and children
2897283 we will work closely with the people and government of iraq to confront those who carry out these barbaric acts
2897284 we know that such senseless attacks will further unite the iraqi people in their rejection of al qaida and the indiscriminate violence they inflict upon the citizens of iraq

2897295 we can do two things we wait here to die and start over or we keep trying to up somehow
2897296 and my brother and sister played at the canada games femke did twice and in the provincials and university and everything so i was always playing with the ball when i was at the field in that way i was influenced
2897297 and it was a little bit of an adventure looking for something else
2897298 they have been playing since they were eight and nine years old going through the whole school system and the club system and the provincial team the canada games
2897299 i dont know if it was the first or second time femke played in the canada games but i remember they would have a special conditioning program for her to bring up her fitness level and he would be doing it with her
2897300 after a second international team trip to holland in the summer of 2006 we started talking about it the level here is only going so far and to go somewhere in sports you have to do it early
2897301 i was thinking about what i was going to have to do what i was going to miss thinking about everything really for quite a while before i really decided
2897302 what i think is the big difference is the tactical part of the game and increased competition there he was getting coached at the high level and then playing a lot a lot a lot
2897303 i dont think we were thinking in terms of a year because you just kind of block that out you just go by the days
2897304 i think youre so busy with wishing for it to be good for him over there that you dont really think about what youre going through once he settled down a little bit you were happy for him but thats when it hits you it was a weird couple of months
2897305 but you know that if he wants it it has to be done now theres no way around it you cant say oh well wait a little bit whenever hes done school when hes a little more independent you just have to do it now when the opportunity is there
2897306 every now and then you think about what youve learned and how youve changed
2897307 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2897308 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2897309 they will never be able to get back in amongst the people in iraq where they have to live and operate in order to be able to be successful
2897310 having lost that support in iraq i think theyre looking where else can they be effective
2897311 any additional force that is sent to afghanistan must come as a result of a reduction in iraq
2897312 many al qaeda leaders are leaving iraq now because they no longer have many places left to hide
2897313 there is no question that the absence of pressure on the pakistani side of the border is creating an opportunity for more people to cross the border and to launch attacks
2897314 they provide money training and strategic propaganda value to the fight
2897315 theres a huge window thats open and i do believe theyve got to close that
2897316 the new security proposals must be workable and should strike the right balance between the need for security and for mobility

2897356 we need inevitably to become integrated into society jos bond a finishes by saying that as we are keen to become a social force our non marginalization integration i would say has to be as deep as it possibly can be and we must become part of the social structure
2897357 spanish society or the social structure as we know it today is the system and spanish society or the system is everything that is those who work those who are unemployed the marginalized the oppressed the oppressors the armed forces politicians institutions the state is it here that we are to integrate ourselves to become a powerful force as he says above all what does being integrated mean to be integrated is to unite the parts of a whole make them live in harmony so that they can fulfil their natural roles
2897358 these roles include differences diversity and opposition to a certain degree but understood as a way of making the whole function properly for the normal functioning of the system we would say this is how political reformism understands this question are the cnt and the libertarian movement integrated in the system no we are within the workings of the system this limits us indeed it represses us and places us in the constraints of authoritarian relations but we are against the system we are not an integral part of the system for its development in fact we are in a position of marginalization accepted by ourselves from this position we try to get our ideas and values across we try to get to the core of this society with our ideas and our practice collaboration or integration as bond a would have would leave us prostrate and defenceless for the creation of alternatives which seek to perform a radical change in society and would make us into yet another part of the system
2897359 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia

2897362 what we will see with the redevelopment here at the ekka is considerably better use of some of the space around the ekka grounds that will in turn pay for new facilities for patrons
2897363 better exhibition space better grand stand facilities and much better use of the ekka space

2897371 i was very firm with vladimir putin in beijing on friday he and i have got a good relationship just as i was firm with the russian president
2897372 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2897373 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2897374 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2897375 then somebody wants to psychoanalyze you stretch you out on the couch go into the differences that might exist
2897376 all i know is i am very proud of the relationships he has established with different leaders
2897377 its also russian prime minister vladimir putin he gets criticized for that but i think its smart and wise and right that he has pleasant relationships with people and that they trust him i think hes developing that with french president nicolas sarkozy i know its there with putin
2897378 it doesnt mean you approve of what putin is doing or his denial of human rights in russia thats the thing that gets me about some of these critics they think if you establish a personal relationship that youre then signing off on everything that person does and thats not right
2897379 and i tell people one reason why was not only did he know what he was doing he was a fabulous father
2897380 when i go around and give talks it seems like people dont really understand their risk of being the victim of insider sabotage
2897381 if you have it then it can happen to you
2897382 when these things happen it forces us to focus on it
2897383 im sure were all looking at this in disbelief and everybody is going to go back and visit their layers of security
2897384 its rare to have a shutdown of this magnitude in a big city
2897385 this is the type of failure that would only be caused by a major problem a major disaster or something like it
2897386 he wanted to look like a hero but unfortunately he was arrested
2897387 it was like we had control of the house but we were unsure of which rooms he had access to
2897388 we didnt know to what extent he had access or if there were potential vulnerabilities in the system
2897389 its sort of pretty shocking that they didnt have any decent oversight of their own network
2897390 forget whether this guy was planning any bad actions what happens if he has a heart attack and they need to access the system thats just crazily bad management but its not uncommon management

2897400 since it was impossible to take control of the lands legally a mafia like culture of theft lies and deception developed in the territories in which the various government authorities are still wallowing from ministers in tailored suits to the last of the policemen sweating on the highways contrary to the rules of international and israeli law contrary to elementary rules of justice contrary to all logic and every genuine israeli interest broad areas were confiscated for the sake of the settlers and huge sums were poured in

2897428 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2897429 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2897430 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2897431 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2897432 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2897433 i have talked with thaksins private secretary who confirmed thaksin will not return to thailand pracha prasobdee said

2897439 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2897440 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2897441 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2897442 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2897443 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2897444 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2897445 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2897446 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened

2897452 hoy nos defraudamos hay que hablar y analizarlo nos falt actitud y entrega eso me preocupa y tendremos que hablar para volver al camino
2897453 fue un resultado que se hizo demasiado f cil para ellos por c mo jugamos nosotros fue uno de los peores partidos de los ltimos tiempos y en ese partido nunca se mostr reacci n
2897454 la verdad que no se jug bien no estamos conformes ni con el resultado ni con el funcionamiento no fuimos los de otros partidos as que nos vamos muy tristes y con muchas cosas para mejorar
2897455 realmente no tuvimos la inercia de los partidos anteriores nos cost llegar al arco nos llegaron mucho y en el segundo tiempo no pudimos sostenernos y el rival nos gan bastante bien
2897456 obviamente tuvimos algunas distracciones que nos costaron goles en las cuales tenemos que trabajar y no hay m s que eso
2897457 gt un gol del seleccionado mexicano en el ltimo minuto da el triunfo a pumas sobre toluca en su compromiso de la fecha 3 del apertura 2008
2897458 i think the goal at the beginning of the week every player here would have said if anybody was under par they would take it
2897459 every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play in a championship like this
2897460 people in michigan are getting excited this is the best they have seen someone in a detroit lions outfit play in a long time
2897461 obviously wearing the detroit lions gear doesnt hurt they want to see someone wearing a lions hat win
2897462 of the three you said there i really do like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively obviously i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem to achieve something they hadnt is very special
2897463 the wind was blowing and the fairways were soft making it extra long and then the pins were very tough in the afternoon
2897464 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2897465 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2897466 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2897467 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2897468 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2897469 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2897470 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2897471 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2897472 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2897473 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2897474 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2897475 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out
2897476 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
2897477 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
2897478 its really important if in a tradition like the ekka that families are able to get there and leave there safely
2897479 so im calling on bcc to ensure that all of its car parks particularly in victoria park that supply parking for families gaining access to the ekka are safe and well lit at night
2897480 here are obvious safety concerns in victoria park at the car parks that have been established for people gaining access to the ekka
2897481 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2897482 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2897483 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2897484 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2897485 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2897486 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2897487 i dont think its unreasonable to expect them to set reasonable rates for political communication
2897488 of course as an independent its always difficult to win at the end of the day but that wasnt a factor in my decision
2897489 theyre a little crazy actually if you think that we broke the 2004 olympic record swam faster than we ever have before and still finished sixth
2897490 i cannot even begin to wonder what is happening in harare at the negotiations as here we are fighting over food
2897491 here there is no maize and peasants from my area who tried to buy some from the state have been cheated out of what they paid for by zanu pf people and the police the maize they paid for was taken by police and the district administrator
2897492 we know children were beginning to starve last week i am trying to manage the situation from bulawayo as i cannot go to my constituency as police are always arresting me there
2897493 honestly we really have nothing to eat but vegetables now

2897495 the raf questions the reasons why the hearing was brought to the cape high court division when the raf headquarters are in gauteng
2897496 the judge did not allow the raf counsel enough time to state his case what was seen in court was a complete disappointment
2897497 the law society says they are semi literate and have never owned bank accounts
2897498 they have also said that claimants who have received large sums of money will squander or steal it there is no more racist statement than that
2897499 yes the legal fraternity may have won this first battle but we have been able to overcome laws and throughout the changes there has always been resistance from the very people benefiting from the system
2897500 they have got interim relief but ultimately this country will get a proper legal system that works
2897501 the court order is welcome and justified relief for poor claimants who would otherwise not be able to use the services of attorneys on a contingency fee basis

2897517 the taliban are now expanding in pakistan much faster than anyone could have imagined
2897518 it has not been their successful strategy as much as the failed policies of the army and musharraf that have created this crisis
2897519 the worlds terrorist leaders were already living on the pakistani side of the border but with the creation of the pakistani taliban they are now able to expand their influence base areas and training camps at will across northern pakistan
2897520 offers a panacea but it will bring relief only if the army the politicians and the international community come together to help the new pakistan government tackle its myriad problems
2897521 success depends on the army and the isi inter service intelligence being pressured or persuaded to give up their twisted logic of insecurity national pride and expansion in the region to help sort out the countrys problems and to be good friends to pakistans neighbours instead of constantly trying to undermine them
2897522 the armys insecurity which since 1947 has essentially bred a covert policy of undermining neighbours has now come full circle for pakistans very future is at stake as extremists threaten to undermine pakistan itself

2897524 the afghans need to evolve a system of governance capable of delivering services to the people and relatively free of tribalism sectarianism and corruption
2897525 so far president hamid karzai has taken his people only partially down that road he has compromised too much with warlords thieves and brigands rather than collaborating with the mainstream afghans who want to rebuild their nation
2897526 the george bush doctrine has been overburdened with lies omissions and spin
2897527 there are reports of civilian casualties as well but at this time we cant confirm it
2897528 at least 19 civilians including women and children were killed in this bombardment

2897530 i am absolutely overjoyed to be back at burnley i think everyone knows what my feelings for this club are and i consider it a great honour and a big challenge to bring in exciting young players both from other clubs and through an already impressive scouting network
2897531 i have vast experience and a strong belief in how the game should be played a belief that i am delighted to say owen coyle shares
2897532 if we can identify the right type of player then i feel we can only help take the club to the next level
2897533 martin will look at all age groups of youngsters from five through to mid teens now that we are building up links with america northern ireland and other countries it will be his role to uncover the players of tomorrow
2897534 although we have dedicated full time staff in there and a wide network of scouts we believe martins expertise will be invaluable the approach to youth development in the modern era is far different than it was perhaps 25 years ago when in many ways burnley was a role model
2897535 the club is reacting to that and while we are making a 2 5 million investment in our gawthorpe training facility we also need a model for the future
2897536 he is the best shooter in the world and i think his is a morale boosting feat for everyone in the contingent

2897544 it stems from jealousy of the great 1970s side more recently the jealousy comes from how devilishly attractive leeds fans are

2897547 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects

2897571 some people do but you can see by the divorce rate by the amount of relationships people go through and the amount of people in unhappy relationships who stay together because of inertia because of children because of fear of loneliness there are very few really wonderful ones

2897574 thats always the hardest part of making any picture getting the financing writing it directing it or anything else is easier than getting the financing for it

2897601 theres no doubt that nsw is in the slow lane of a two lane highway and the western australian and queensland governments are doing pretty well
2897602 the only government in australia in which small and medium businesses have less confidence than the rudd government is that of morris iemma here in nsw
2897603 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2897604 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2897605 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2897606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2897607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2897608 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2897609 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2897610 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2897611 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2897612 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2897613 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2897614 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2897615 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2897616 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2897617 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2897618 who are open to doing something on the production side
2897619 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2897620 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2897621 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2897622 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2897623 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2897624 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2897625 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2897626 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2897627 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2897628 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2897629 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2897630 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2897631 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2897632 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2897633 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2897634 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2897635 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2897636 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2897637 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2897638 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2897639 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2897640 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2897641 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2897642 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2897643 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2897644 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2897645 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2897646 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2897647 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2897648 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2897649 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2897650 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2897651 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2897652 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2897653 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2897654 i call on our countrymen not to be allowed to be used by this drug syndicate it is not worth the money for you to be away from your family you will be punished with either life imprisonment or death
2897655 there were some incidents in 2006 and 2007 but the number shot up in 2008 to an alarming level
2897656 i worry about how they are convinced to go out of china and bring these drugs back there
2897657 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2897658 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2897659 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2897660 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2897661 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2897662 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2897663 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2897664 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2897665 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2897666 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2897667 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2897668 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2897669 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2897670 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2897671 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2897672 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2897673 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2897674 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2897675 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2897676 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2897677 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2897678 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2897679 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2897680 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2897681 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2897682 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2897683 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2897684 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2897685 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2897686 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2897687 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2897688 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2897689 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2897690 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2897691 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2897692 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2897693 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2897694 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2897695 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2897696 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

2897744 the third step for a de escalation would be the withdrawal of all troops on both sides but a withdrawal accompanied by observers
2897745 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
2897746 the revelation if true lends enormous credence to what was generally talked about in pakistans streets about the likely killers of benazir bhutto it also lends significance to the last e mail she had sent to her lobbyist in the united states pointing out dangers to her life and indicating who she suspected could be involved if something happened to her
2897747 in the final analysis nothing remains secret and it is a law of nature to expose killers tyrants and brigands in ways one cannot even comprehend

2897749 concordo com o que o jornalista kennedy alencar colocou na folha de ontem ao comentar a tortura realizada pelos militares no tempo da ditadura entretanto uma coisa importante dizer totalmente descabida a pretens o dos militares de se igualarem aos guerrilheiros terroristas pois eles os militares cometeram crime de tortura enquanto agentes do estado e sob a prote o deste como ressaltou o jornalista seria a mesma coisa que comparar o ex rcito nazista com os partisans e com outros combatentes da resist ncia isso seria considerado um absurdo da mesma forma ocorreu aqui n s est vamos tamb m dominados por uma for a militar que usurpou o governo e estabeleceu uma tirania portanto lutar contra ela mesmo militarmente n o foi um crime mas praticar tortura foi um crime sim hediondo na declara o de independ ncia dos estados unidos est escrito que todo povo submetido tirania tem o direito de pegar em armas para derrub la

2897760 historians will come to view aug 8 2008 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell russias attack on sovereign georgian territory marked the official return of history indeed to an almost 19th century style of great power competition complete with virulent nationalisms battles for resources struggles over spheres of influence and territory and even though it shocks our 21st century sensibilities the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives yes we will continue to have globalization economic interdependence the european union and other efforts to build a more perfect international order but these will compete with and at times be overwhelmed by the harsh realities of international life that have endured since time immemorial the next president had better be ready

2897762 while these events are rare they can have serious consequences so consumers and their prescribers should weigh this up when deciding on how to manage sleep problems
2897763 this kind of thing is ludicrous that such errors could be permitted to occur and not have controls in place to prevent them occurring
2897764 while we dont want to go off the deep end about a single error the fact is corporations arent being careful enough with consumer data and are not being held to account
2897765 where there is a real risk of serious harm occurring as a result
2897766 a mandatory data breach notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases in full compliance with the privacy act
2897767 he was really intelligent fit and a really lovable guy with a great sense of humour she said
2897768 my little brother i love you so so much amp cant believe they have taken you from us how cruel you will always be with me such a wonderful special person so kind and caring and loved by so many
2897769 mate what can i say im gutted more then gutted you will always be a brother to me you lived your dream life in oz with the person you loved and it got taken away
2897770 he was a great guy much loved member of the team one of those rare individuals who was both incredibly capable and had a really great vivacious spirit he said
2897771 he was fun loving young energetic everyone here has taken it very hard
2897772 i saw him lying on the ground there were several people treating him and they had his shirt off and someone yelling to runners to keep moving it was quite unsettling she said
2897773 he seemed fit he wasnt rippling with muscles but he had a slim build he wasnt fat
2897774 in people over 50 its almost always due to coronary heart disease in a younger person it is still frequently due to coronary disease but more often due to other problems he said
2897775 an arrhythmia is almost always the cause of sudden death he said
2897776 the heart develops this chaotic rhythm it quivers and doesnt pump out blood and the person loses consciousness
2897777 this type of occurrence happens at least once in most city2surf races
2897778 people shouldnt undertake this sort of activity without training for it it tends to stress themselves out
2897779 it can still happen because some people have inherited predisposition to having problems of rhythmic generation or with the muscles of their heart
2897780 became convinced that natural gas had a number of advantages over gasoline and diesel as a vehicle fuel
2897781 natural gas is already an inexpensive and extremely available fuel in most states it only costs about 1 per gallon then you have oil in the united states including new reserves in alaska and the gulf that we werent previously allowed to drill into demand for foreign oil would be down thus lowering the price significantly if pickens plan comes into effect i expect to see gas prices to be about the same as they were in 1990 1 51 per gallon and natural gas prices heavily inflated by tax to be about the same price we could also perhaps see additional taxation on gas and natural gas maybe somewhere to the tune of fifty cents per gallon to help alleviate the cost of building a bunch of wind mills to power our homes even with that additional tax 2 00 per gallon sure sounds a lot better than 4 15
2897782 we are the standard for all building structures of the future
2897783 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb

2897803 the highest divorce rate was among navy personnel in 2006 that service had a divorce rate among its married personnel of 3 4 percent

2897805 we are in the process of building a strong campaign organization the size and scope of which this state has never seen before these 29 field offices are in every region of the state including towns that have never seen a presidential campaign office before
2897806 he had this fabulous smile and a great twinkle in his eyes
2897807 the first thought that went through my mind when i met him was uh oh stay away from that one
2897808 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
2897809 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
2897810 when you care for someone with anything like this you have to be on such an intimate level that a lot of people cant handle it and walk away with the care that i give him your guard has to be totally down and you have to be totally open all i know is i cant imagine being with anyone else and feeling as strong for them as i do for this man

2897821 see i will be able to empathize with the people in the house better because i have been through the experience and i know what they will be going through at that point of time so i think it will be easier for me to relate to them and we are all human beings so i think i m going to try and make it hosting of the bigg boss show entertaining with a human touch

2897837 together these three papers represent a landmark week in schizophrenia genetics
2897838 this is an important step in helping to unravel the challenging biology of schizophrenia
2897839 the human dna blueprint consists of three billion letters of code most of which are the same between individuals but about 10 million of which can take at least two forms
2897840 these single nucleotide snp variations are scattered throughout the entire code and particular forms of the letters may either increase risk for a particular disease or be used as a signpost for nearby variations which cause disease
2897841 we were able to show in a very large sample that a snp within the znf804a gene on chromosome 2 was associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia
2897842 this finding strongly supports a role for the znf804a gene in schizophrenia however the associated snp within this gene is probably just a signpost for one or more disease causing mutations located nearby
2897843 it is crucial that we identify these mutations and work out how they contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia

2897847 current students will be on hand to provide an insight into life as a uq ipswich student and university staff will provide information about our program offerings and career opportunities
2897848 it is an opportunity to visit the cafes enjoy the displays and get a feel for campus life

2897855 the chinese team were very speedy in the first 15 minutes
2897856 but after that we got into our normal pace we also showed very good team work
2897857 and to get a goal against the worlds strongest team i am happy
2897858 we just won back to back series here at home were playing solid baseball
2897859 we can easily identify mistakes maybe in the strategy of the game the execution of a pitch here or there but i cant say that weve played inconsistent baseball
2897860 when we play well we can play with anyone thats when we dont make mistakes
2897861 zach keeps throwing like that hes going to be fine
2897862 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation weve also spoken with the national olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality
2897863 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
2897864 of course i should have known that i mean obviously you cant like hot dogs because your hair is brown

2897867 wow she must be tougher than she looks working in a coal mine for most of her life
2897868 you should try a day in my head the non stop comments are maddening
2897869 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
2897870 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
2897871 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
2897872 it is not an incident that we are aware of
2897873 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
2897874 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
2897875 we always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion and as acknowledged by the border patrol this was the case in the episode at ajo
2897876 withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it
2897877 down to a t and it matched exactly what they mexican soldiers wear
2897878 nobody was ever held accountable particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers we note that border patrol agents have historically driven worn out junk vehicles
2897879 the only thing you can do in that kind of situation is seek cover
2897880 im not going to lose someone in an unfair fight
2897881 the question is beyond my understanding what is the question and to think that english is my first language

2897887 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2897888 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2897889 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2897890 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2897891 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2897892 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2897893 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software
2897894 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2897895 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth

2897970 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
2897971 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
2897972 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
2897973 never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
2897974 the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
2897975 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
2897976 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
2897977 the last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs for the first time ever a non eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter of eurasian power relations but also as the worlds paramount power the defeat and collapse of the soviet union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a western hemisphere power the united states as the sole and indeed the first truly global power
2897978 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
2897979 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
2897980 for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia now a non eurasian power is preeminent in eurasia and americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained
2897981 americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability it would prompt global anarchy
2897982 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical eurasia is the globes largest continent and is geopolitically axial a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
2897983 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad this limits the use of americas power especially its capacity for military intimidation never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
2897984 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
2897985 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
2897986 henceforth the united states may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push america out of eurasia thereby threatening americas status as a global power
2897987 uzbekistan nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central asian states represents the major obstacle to any renewed russian control over the region its independence is critical to the survival of the other central asian states and it is the least vulnerable to russian pressures
2897988 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
2897989 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the u s department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
2897990 uzbekistan is in fact the prime candidate for regional leadership in central asia
2897991 once pipelines to the area have been developed turkmenistans truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the countrys people
2897992 in fact an islamic revival already abetted from the outside not only by iran but also by saudi arabia is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms determined to oppose any reintegration under russian and hence infidel control
2897993 for pakistan the primary interest is to gain geostrategic depth through political influence in afghanistan and to deny to iran the exercise of such influence in afghanistan and tajikistan and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking central asia with the arabian sea
2897994 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
2897995 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
2897996 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
2897997 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy
2897998 without sustained and directed american involvement before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene and the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of todays eurasia but of the world more generally
2897999 with warning signs on the horizon across europe and asia any successful american policy must focus on eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design
2898000 that puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge americas primacy
2898001 the most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
2898002 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
2898003 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
2898004 i didnt have the year i wanted to have last year i could only control my part and obviously i didnt play as much as i wanted

2898008 my elbow got caught in a guys chin strap buckle
2898009 the door is open to any player we feel makes us better but there is no one out there at this time that we feel strongly about
2898010 whats exciting is that weve developed generally speaking the cognitive mechanism to free us from the things that determine so much of our behavior and by doing so weve sort of cut the rope from the rest of the animal kingdom we can do things and we can cultivate certain behavior even though there are obviously a lot of tendencies that are part of our biology for example heres an idea that comes from evolutionary psychology an observation that i think is rather shrewd why are members of our species drawn to the fictional experience
2898011 well the key concept in understanding status has to do with the idea of social comparison

2898025 we are definitely not out of it to get a team silver or gold
2898026 i was delighted by the way the team took up the challenge and attacked the course and we were pleased with the way they all finished afterwards all our horses are good jumpers but you never know what the cross country may have taken out of the them
2898027 hes a relentless galloper but i was concerned about that fence and yogi knew it
2898028 the horses were generally finishing better than we had thought we were lucky with the weather although the course became pretty slippery in several places
2898029 i was really really pleased with him said cook of the 10 year old miners frolic
2898030 hes a super jumper but we had not had the smoothest of weeks
2898031 the plane journey really took it out of him but the morale throughout the team has been very high it was a do or die effort and he put his best foot forward

2898039 the government wants to control the number of people going into sensitive conflict areas due to negative stories appearing in the media overseas
2898040 we are careful not to criticise the government there is a kind of subtle censorship we are careful what we say or visas could get cancelled
2898041 the most significant challenge to the recovery process in sri lanka is ongoing civil conflict escalating violence over the past few years has set back reconstruction efforts in the north and east of the country though it continues largely apace in the south
2898042 the new rules on ngo personnel are the consequence of a cause and effect syndrome created by a stupid few in the ngo mainstream which has unfortunately discredited the silent and substantial contribution made by many in the ngo community in our society
2898043 with the war going against the terrorists now they some ngos are even worse than terrorists at least the terrorists fought for a cause they believed in for which they were prepared to sacrifice their lives the ngo vocalists sang for their supper for which they were rewarded and now the entire ngo community has to suffer being regulated the bottom line is that the nationalists have now set rules for the internationalists for being unbalanced and getting their equation bizarre
2898044 the blatant lack of will of the sri lankan government to establish the truth
2898045 acf sees the launching of an international inquiry as the only reliable means for identifying the perpetrators acf executive director francois danel said
2898046 the concept here is that ngos should recruit locally as far as possible and should only find expertise for the posts which cannot be filled locally due to unavailability of suitable candidates
2898047 in that sense this is welcome because it brings these together and streamlines them into a formal process
2898048 there were many problems caused by foreign ngo workers and i believe the concern of government over the large number of expatriate workers to some extent is justified
2898049 there is too much paper work time and energy involved in bringing down expatriates and then more rules to get them into conflict areas
2898050 how do we help people avoid those who are selling the snake oil and find those businesses service providers and people who are really doing good work
2898051 in a historic achievement the mogo computer program defeated myungwan kim 8p thursday by 1
2898052 another usage is for ai in order to detect visibility from one player to another you can use rays to detect blocking objects you can also use the visibility determination for pathfinding it is interesting to note that the usage of rays for collision detection and ai is already used in some current games but this is sometimes not done against the complete dynamic scene or it is done with only a few rays from talking to game developers we already got the feedback that they would also like to be able to spend more rays on those queries
2898053 i would guess that its one of the most sophisticated ai systems out there
2898054 200 or 300 of these experiences laid back to back and you can make a game out of that
2898055 in halo 2 it was attempted to be solved behaviorally
2898056 in the long term a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks while producing an annual sustained yield of timber fibre or energy from the forest will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit
2898057 a technical paper that details the source data the methods used and the full results is being prepared for a scientific journal
2898058 one hectare of mature tall wet forest can store the equivalent of 5500 tonnes of carbon dioxide
2898059 can store three times more carbon than scientists previously thought
2898060 the value of gpp used was the maximum annual value for the period from 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2005 the maximum was used in order to exclude periods of major disturbance such as the 2003 bushfires
2898061 the difference in carbon stocks between our estimates and the ipcc default values is the result of us using local data collected from natural forests not disturbed by logging our estimates therefore reflect the carbon carrying capacity of the natural forests
2898062 if logging in native eucalypt forests was halted the carbon stored in the intact forests would be protected and the degraded forests would be able to regrow their carbon stocks to their natural carbon carrying capacity
2898063 we founded humble daisy on august 14th 2002 with the idea that the company would be a

2898072 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2898073 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2898074 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2898075 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2898107 i know that its really stressed her out a bit
2898108 of course shes always been very mature and shes always been trusted to make her own choices mike tries to step in and kind of be the father figure and it doesnt work out so well
2898109 its a little soon and he tries to do it in a very unthreatening way but julie still doesnt like it
2898110 shes always supported her mothers happiness shes kind of like the mother in the relationship and shes rooted for nothing other than her to be utterly happy she sees that mike brings her that and she really likes mike so i think shes happy its just like he cant tell her what to do but im so happy because i absolutely adore jamie i love him so much and im so happy that hes my new daddy
2898111 i hear that i get another new love interest so that could always be interesting i dont know who it will be dont know when thatll happen but supposedly thats on the horizon so im kind of excited about that i think its fun its something thats very realistic for my characters age i think that its something else for me to explore and its always fun to do that i loved working with josh its kind of nice to work with people who are in my age range so it was fun
2898112 they mentioned it briefly before and they actually mentioned it in a line and then they took it out so i dont know we live in fairview so maybe its fairview community college for her it doesnt worry me because ive loved my experience on the show and i treasure every moment of it i might be going off to college myself so it might work out nicely do i want my character to go off to college no im very happy where i am but i wouldnt be too devastated if it happened because none of us feel too secure with their jobs being that people get killed left and right i think we all live with the suspicion that were going to be going
2898113 it looks like both formats are going to be around for a long time
2898114 my advice now if you can hold out for a better performing lower cost multiformat hd dvd and blu ray player do so
2898115 we think it will ultimately become an iso standard lets just do it the right way
2898116 sees reason for both of these standards to co exist as approved iso specifications
2898117 desktop linux still has three serious problems to overcome before it can go mass market
2898118 wifi is the next big nightmare i look at it as more noise equals more risk wifi used to have so few hotspots that it was real easy to monitor now airports alone have 50 or 60 hotspots available some are clearly set by bad guys others are riskier than others it is now impossible to monitor
2898119 with wireless signals radiating air space anyone can receive and capture the information
2898120 in the past it took an expert to hack a wireless network but now anyone that can follow a step by step guide and point and click has a good chance of hacking in
2898121 these programs can also be used to flood an access point with association requests making the access point unable to respond to legitimate wireless traffic
2898122 the convenience for wifi is undeniable it is a great tool for people this makes it a hot seller new users are now setting up their own equipment with no prior knowledge they are joining wifi networks with no idea about security
2898123 hackers will take advantage of these opportunities when they find them the more people get hooked on the mobile convenience of connecting to the internet wherever they are the more they start doing the same kinds of activities they do on their more secured desktop computers at home or in the office
2898124 the simplest precaution when using wifi is to enable security most wifi points support wep and wpa
2898125 many laptops have high level wifi for corporate use many people are not it trained plus they dont really care about security about 50 percent of wifi users have wep enabled
2898126 wep is secure but doesnt take hackers as long to crack

2898153 dup sut de ani ce va mai ram ne din ortodoxia noastra
2898154 rusie daca ti lepezi credinta asa cum si au parasit o deja at tia intelectuali nu vei mai fi rusia sau sf nta rusie iar daca poporul rus nu se va cai atunci sf rsitul lumii este aproape domnul ni l va lua pe tarul pravoslavnic si va trimite un bici sub chipul unor c rmuitori necredinciosi cruzi care se vor impune si vor umple ntreg pam ntul de s nge si lacrimi
2898155 cine spune ca rusia este pierduta c rusia a pierit nu nu nu e pierduta rusia nu a pierit si nu va pieri dar poporul rus trebuie sa se cur easc de pacat prin aceste grele ncercari fiecare trebuie sa se roage si sa se pocaiasca amarnic dar rusia nu este pierduta si nu a pierit
2898156 va fi o furtuna si corabia rusiei va fi zdrobita n bucati
2898157 dar corabia nu mai exista este facuta bucati a pierit totul a pierit
2898158 pentru ca o mare minune a domnului va avea loc si toate r m i ele si bucatile prin puterea si vointa lui dumnezeu se vor aduna laolalt si se vor lipi la loc si corabia se va reconstrui la fel de frumoasa si va porni n calatoria poruncita de dumnezeu
2898159 prigoanele mpotriva credintei vor spori fara ncetare va fi o durere si un ntuneric cum nu s a mai vazut si aproape toate bisericile vor fi nchise dar atunci c nd oamenii nu vor mai putea ndura atunci va veni si izbavirea toate vor nflori bisericile vor ncepe sa fie reconstruite dar aceasta va fi nflorirea dinaintea sf rsitului
2898160 acum traim vremurile de dinaintea antihristului dar totusi rusia se va izbavi va fi multa suferinta mult chin ntreaga rusie va deveni temni si de multa nchinaciune catre domnul va fi nevoie pentru iertare trebuie sa ne pocaim de pacatele noastre si sa ne temem sa mai pacatuim fie i putin n schimb sa ne straduim sa facem bine chiar si cel mai mic bine pentru ca p na si aripa unui fluture are greutate dar balan a lui dumnezeu este foarte precis si atunci c nd cel mai mic bine va nclina cump na atunci si va revarsa dumnezeu mila asupra rusiei
2898161 va fi o rabufnire nemaiv zut si o minune a domnului se va arata si viata care va urma va fi cu totul diferita dar toate acestea nu vor dura mult
2898162 rusia se va ridica si chiar daca din punct de vedere material nu va fi bogata duhovnice te va cunoaste mare bogatie iar la optina vor mai fi sapte luminarii sapte st lpi
2898163 i m kon evici manastirea optina si epoca ei jordanville 1973 p 538
2898164 ma ntrebati despre viitorul apropiat si despre vremurile din urma
2898165 poporul rus n general a sav rsit mari pacate si lor li se datoreaza neajunsurile din ziua de astazi mai precis pacatele s nt ncalcarea legam ntului si regicidul
2898166 pentru istoria omenirii semnificatia martiriului familiei imperiale care se apropie de evenimente biblice dintre cele mai importante consta n aceea ca perioada constantinopolitana a existentei bisericii lui hristos a aluat astfel sf rsit si s a deschis o noua epoca de martiriu apocaliptica ea a nceput cu sacrificiul voluntar al celui din urma mparat ortodox uns de dumnezeu si al familiei sale tragedia familiei imperiale ntuneca precum un blestem pam ntul rusiei si s a transformat n prologul simbolic al lungului drum rusesc al crucii moartea a zeci de milioane dintre fiii si fiicele ei canonizarea martirilor imperiali va nsemna pentru rusia spalarea ei de pacatul regicidului asa se va izbavi ea n cel din urma de blestemele raului
2898167 de multe ori am auzit din gura marelui si placutului de dumnezeu ntelept parintele serafim ca el nu avea sa ram na n trup la sarov si iata ca eu unul motovilov am ndraznit sa l ntreb batiuska mereu spui ca nu vei ram ne cu trupul tau la sarov asta nseamna ca te vor alunga calugarii sfintia ta domnul dumnezeu a poruncit ca eu umilul serafim sa traiesc cu mult mai mult dec t o suta de ani dar fiindca pe atunci episcopii vor fi devenit at t de lipsiti de credinta nc t n lipsa lor de credinta i vor depasi chiar si pe episcopii greci din vremea lui teodosie cel t nar de aceea a binevoit domnul dumnezeu sa ma ia pe mine umilul serafim din viata aceasta lumeasca p na atunci si atunci sa ma nvie si nvierea mea va fi precum nvierea celor sapte tineri n pestera din ocilon n zilele lui teodosie cel t nar dupa ce mi a dezvaluit aceasta mare si nfricosatoare taina marele ntelept mi a spus ca dupa nvierea sa va merge de la sarov la diveievo si ca acolo va ncepe sa propovaduiasca lumii ntregi cainta pentru aceasta propovaduire si mai ales pentru minunea nvierii mari multimi de oameni se vor aduna din toate colturile pam ntului diveievo va deveni lavra vertianova oras iar arzamas provincie si propovaduind cainta la diveievo batiuska serafim va dezvalui acolo patru moaste si dupa ce le va dezvalui el nsusi se va culca ntre ele cur nd dupa aceea se vor sf rsi toate
2898168 si n zilele acelea de mare durere n care se spune ca nici un trup nu se va izbavi dec t daca de dragul celor alesi zilele acelea vor fi scurtate n zilele acelea cei ce vor ram ne dintre credinciosi vor trai pe pielea lor ceva asemanator cu ce a trait odata domnul nsusi c nd rastignit fiind pe cruce si fiind dumnezeu desav rsit si om desav rsit s a simtit at t de parasit de dumnezeirea sa nc t a strigat catre tatal dumnezeul meu dumnezeul meu de ce m ai parasit cei din urma crestini vor simti pe pielea lor o abandonare asemanatoare a omenirii de catre slava lui dumnezeu dar numai pentru scurt timp dupa care domnul nu va mai am na mult revenirea sa n toata slava sa si cu toti ngerii alaturi de el si atunci se va nfaptui n toata plinatatea tot ce s a hotar t din vremuri imemoriale n conclavul dinaintea vesniciei al sfintei treimi
2898169 acusi acusi va fi o mare sarbatoare aici la diveievo
2898170 sf nta rusie nu poate fi ngropata nu poate muri ea este eterna si victorioasa si ea este cea care va avea ultimul cuv nt de spus n istoria poporului nostru sf nta rusie a parasit numai suprafata vietii contemporane dar continua sa traiasca n strafundurile ei ascunse n stare latenta p na i va veni timpul p na c nd dumnezeu va binevoi dupa ce a supravietuit iernii sa i ngaduie sa iasa din nou la suprafata si sa mpodobeasca fata pam ntului rus care a fost at t de crud biciuit de furtuni nemiloase si nghetate
2898171 pedepsindu l domnul i arata n acelasi timp poporului rus calea spre m ntuire fac ndu l propovaduitorul ortodoxiei n ntreaga lume diaspora rusa a rasp ndit ortodoxia n toate colturile lumii majoritatea rusilor exilati s nt chiar daca ei nu stiu propovaduitori ai ortodoxiei rusilor din strainatate le a fost dat sa straluceasca n ntreaga lume n lumina ortodoxiei n asa fel nc t alte popoare vaz nd faptele lor bune sa l slaveasca pe tatal carele este n ceruri si sa si obtina astfel m ntuirea diaspora va trebui sa se angajeze pe calea caintei si dupa ce va fi obtinut izbavirea prin rugaciuni catre dumnezeu si prin renastere spirituala va fi capabila sa faca sa renasca si patria noastra aflata n suferinta
2898172 treziti va din somnul deznadejdii voi fii ai rusiei priviti slava suferintelor ei si curatati va spalati va de pacate ntariti va n credinta ortodoxa ca sa fiti demni de a locui n locuinta domnului si de a va stabili pe muntele lui cel sf nt sari sari ridica te tu rusie tu care din m inile domnului ai baut cupa m niei lui c nd se vor fi ncheiat suferintele tale pravoslavnicia ta ti va sta alaturi si slava domnului te va nsoti popoarele vor veni sa ia din lumina ta si regii din stralucirea care se va revarsa asupra ta atunci ridica ti ochii si priveste priveste copiii tai veniti catre tine dinspre apus dinspre miazanoapte dinspre mare si dinspre rasarit binecuv nt ndu te ntru hristos pe vecie amin

2898200 music goes straight to the hearts and minds of all people beyond colour class religion any status its the last remaining voice of the human spirit
2898201 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2898202 as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people
2898203 we are far away from home and we live in a strange area
2898204 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2898205 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2898206 i said wait a minute the community doesnt even know anything about it
2898207 we were sold down the river before anybody even knew what this thing was
2898208 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2898209 the risk reward ratio is something that needs to be discussed in more detail
2898210 we are not daunted we are really excited what an inspirational show
2898211 the philosophy of throwing them out or making a change doesnt seem to be filtering down in these cases
2898212 thats something you hear about more on the national level
2898213 there was a lot more hubbub at this point this year were just not seeing it
2898214 so many times its the primary winner who wins the seat
2898215 i think this primary is a really exciting time in lee county history voters have the opportunity to shape local government for years to come just look at law enforcement we have a sheriffs race and a public defenders race thats two major branches of law enforcement then youve got county commission and school board its huge and with turnout usually so low every persons vote really matters
2898216 one thing i learned is that theres always a simple answer until you get in there and start learning a little more about it and you find out things are not as simple as you think at least we have people in there now who know how the county works in tough economic times when were looking at budget cuts its not a time for learning on the job
2898217 this is someone who thinks he can do anything to anybody at any time
2898218 hickory dickory doc bruce and this other guy sitting by some trees exchanging personalities its like having two in one actually its rather fun
2898219 their science is suspect but even if they had done a better job its still the wrong guy
2898220 when i do i will do it with my lawyer
2898221 he had a reputation for being trusted with these materials
2898222 these guys arent letting up sometimes theyre following me home they wont let me breathe
2898223 there was 25 feet 8 metres of snow and toward spring as the snow melted on the surrounding plateau my tent was left high in the air and we had to make steps to get up to it
2898224 state law requires buyers and sellers to provide specific information to txdot to keep vehicle ownership records correct and up to date
2898225 its something that will increase what we do for the public and serve them much better many younger people believe they can do a text message today to 911 and they cannot
2898226 in this era where everybody is texting it is very imperative that we accommodate the way people communicate
2898227 if you give them a lot of data you have to give them a way to digest it all
2898228 i just remember the spanish teacher the spanish teacher was hispanic
2898229 once this north forest issue is on the table and at the state level some of those parents out there will be looking at it
2898230 i would hope one or two or as many as want to get involved
2898231 they raise their families they pay their bills a lot of them are paycheck to paycheck but they want their kids to have a good education thats what the american dream is all about
2898232 but when 30 percent of the student population comes to 50 percent they will be thats not too far in the future
2898233 how do we save this school district how do we save this black school district
2898234 she would pick on the hispanic kids and not the black kids
2898235 students who were in the program should have never been in the program
2898236 when i was in elementary school i didnt have one single hispanic teacher and that bothered me
2898237 role models are important that does affect a kids self esteem
2898238 ive been in that community all my life i got accustomed to it
2898239 it wasnt that difficult for me to make friends with whomever it was a nice experience
2898240 this grant should help us immeasurably toward our goal of translating research into improved survival in five years
2898241 specifically we hope itll lead to the development of a unique agent against the disease
2898242 the thought is that well we could have used deadly force but instead we tased
2898243 but the end result is still the same were dealing with a situation where a sick call turns into someone losing their life
2898244 that creates a sensation wherein the individual whos targeted is then rendered motionless
2898245 we cant tell her it will scare her too much
2898246 the only thing i know is the loud bang and after that i did not know anything until later on when i wake up
2898247 i lie down in the middle of the field all i know is i couldnt move
2898248 because of my religious faith we try to go there every year to pray to spend some time with my family together and let my kids learn something about their religion
2898249 i know theres a lot of people who need more help who have lost a loved one
2898250 i wish i could have been there for my mom at the time when she needed me most
2898251 i should have been there to help her i could have helped her somehow
2898252 im not even family and this has affected me so much
2898253 they were not family to me but they are family
2898254 no one thought the people on this bus would die
2898255 its not really as much protesting as students taking charge
2898256 i guess protest was pretty popular in the 60s i see me and other students doing positive things rather than protesting
2898257 in my generation maybe about 10 percent really care but those who care are really passionate about it
2898258 then there were several generations that were not active at all it impresses me how important the work that young people are now doing is
2898259 now theres an expectation among our students that they give something back
2898260 you walk to a football game and you see them
2898261 i want to change the world but you have to do it one issue at a time
2898262 theres a lot more people going to college these days and we have to ensure were preserving accessibility for everyone
2898263 for far too long we have not had a legitimate place at the table
2898264 they will take off by plane to protest at the republican convention or the world social forum in brazil
2898265 i saw what it was like to live in that kind of poverty
2898266 in the 60s student issues were domestic u s involvement in the vietnam war or the civil rights movement now were looking at globalization and our impact on the world
2898267 i think there is more and more the realization that any human problem it is part of our human lives and we have a role to play
2898268 there are a lot of other areas id rather be working on but because this is my responsibility its what ive been doing
2898269 i do not see a need to get this thing called education i can make it without it i will use my smartness and guile to get what i want and need
2898270 im happy because i know kids are going to get what they need
2898271 people who responded in the community know that they were part of something bigger than themselves and thats a good feeling
2898272 the best part for me was connecting with the community
2898273 se equivocaron al no decirle eso en el cac pero eso es as

2898341 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2898342 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city

2898424 bernie mac just say what you want to say but cant
2898425 youre still going have to do the dishes and the laundry and all that
2898426 you were on air force one and you couldnt stop to pick up the kids
2898427 you know how to tell if a persons poor you look in the fridge if theres nothing in there but bologna youre talkin serious poor mmmm but that bologna was good we used to fry it up till a black circle formed at the edges then roll it like a hot dog and eat it slow make it last lots of beans in our house too pinto beans lima beans red beans and cereal only youd be eating it with a fork leave the milk at the bottom for the next guy i aint lyin
2898428 mit dem georgischen volk und seiner demokratisch gew hlten regierung angesichts der bedrohung f r georgiens souver nit t und territorialen integrit t
2898429 inakzeptabel besonders wenn sie von dem vertreter eines landes stammen dessen aktionen im irak afghanistan und serbien uns allen wohlbewusst sind
2898430 wir m ssen ber verhandlungen sprechen und ber eine politische l sung eine milit rische gibt es nicht
2898431 die russische regierung erneut auf georgiens territoriale integrit t und souver nit t zu respektieren
2898432 wir hatten eine gute beziehung als klar wurde dass sie nicht weiterbestehen w rden entschieden sie sich daf r die lizenz zu verkaufen wir sind da direkt rein und haben sie uns geschnappt wir haben keine assets bernommen um ehrlich zu sein es gab keine assets die man nutzen konnte wir entwickeln alles komplett neu
2898433 its possible that there are differences but its extremely improbable
2898434 this is still an open investigation so i cant go into details or provide you a description of samples
2898435 however we stand by our test results which demonstrated a genetic match to the serotype salmonella saintpaul in both samples of water used for irrigation and composite samples of serrano peppers
2898436 its not the mexico you think of with the donkey pulling the plow
2898437 what makes this outbreak notable is the number of persons that has become sickened with this same strain
2898438 weve eaten peppers since i was a little girl and have never had a problem
2898439 its as if they were to tell us not to eat tortillas
2898440 its something that will increase what we do for the public and serve them much better many younger people believe they can do a text message today to 911 and they cannot
2898441 in this era where everybody is texting it is very imperative that we accommodate the way people communicate
2898442 if you give them a lot of data you have to give them a way to digest it all
2898443 the thought is that well we could have used deadly force but instead we tased
2898444 but the end result is still the same were dealing with a situation where a sick call turns into someone losing their life
2898445 that creates a sensation wherein the individual whos targeted is then rendered motionless
2898446 moreno hat nach dem test am abend peking schon wieder verlassen ohne zu wissen wie das ergebnis ausf llt

2898449 we cant tell her it will scare her too much
2898450 the only thing i know is the loud bang and after that i did not know anything until later on when i wake up
2898451 i lie down in the middle of the field all i know is i couldnt move
2898452 because of my religious faith we try to go there every year to pray to spend some time with my family together and let my kids learn something about their religion
2898453 i know theres a lot of people who need more help who have lost a loved one
2898454 i wish i could have been there for my mom at the time when she needed me most
2898455 i should have been there to help her i could have helped her somehow
2898456 im not even family and this has affected me so much
2898457 they were not family to me but they are family

2898464 i didnt go in planning to break the world record im very excited it was a great swim she said
2898465 its kind of weird because when you are little you dream of being famous its weird to become that person you dont expect it to happen to you
2898466 oh what a lovely war movie ben stiller and his platoon have concocted a broad action comedy that manages to mix subtlety with satire stiller manages his movie nicely so that all actors get their share of the comic spotlight
2898467 presiding over tropic thunder is its magnificent secret weapon tom cruise buried in a ridiculous bald wig and sporting a forest of chest hair he portrays a heartless studio mogul whose greed dooms the production this one could have the subtitle how i learned to stop worrying and love the blockbuster
2898468 undeniably provokes quite a few laughs but of the most hollow kind apart from startling out there comic turns by robert downey jr and tom cruise the antics here are pretty thin redundant and one note but that note will strike a chord with a substantial comic heat seeking audience particularly of the fanboy and combat ready stripes
2898469 because of math i delivered my kids to get high education
2898470 because of math i could have a motorbike and i have no obligation
2898471 in case if i couldnt pay they will take back the motorbike and i will loose money that i already paid to the lease company then why i should take that risk
2898472 its still 9 oclock in the morning what can i sell until 12
2898473 es para la buena suerte pero no podemos hablar sobre esto es un secreto si te lo decimos lo echar amos a perder

2898475 its not good to read in the paper that three of your coaches are being interviewed for jobs
2898476 but i dont mind it happening its just a perception issue and a logistical issue
2898477 hes got enormous courage browny to get out there but hes got a lot of things that hes coping with
2898478 anyone who goes to training knows he just cant get out there wednesdays so hes barely getting out there from week to week
2898479 its very difficult when you do that because you de train a little bit just playing weekends and getting up for the following weekend it makes it very tough to play anywhere near the level you are capable of
2898480 hell play all the games by the look of it
2898481 i sort of feel like from fourth to 12th you cant say that fourth is a better team than 12th
2898482 but someone will finish fourth and fifth and sixth because theyve won more games than the team that finishes 12th and its probably going to be a handful of games
2898483 i believe we have the capabilities to play finals and we have to win the last three to do that and thats a big percentage ask
2898484 the kangaroos have won their last five and we had every chance of beating kangaroos if we played a better last few minutes
2898485 its a matter of which game you take so on that basis i think weve got the same capabilities as the teams that are in and around the top eight
2898486 the test of the athlete revealed that she had tested positive for epo
2898487 moreno left china the evening of the test before she knew of the results
2898488 her accreditation has been cancelled and withdrawn by the ioc we have asked the sports governing body the international cycling union uci to follow it up as any disciplinary measures will be complete after the games finish

2898507 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2898508 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2898509 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2898510 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2898511 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2898512 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2898513 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2898514 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2898515 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it

2898525 it is more about weakness in other economies in the eurozone for instance
2898526 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2898527 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar
2898528 the rba appears to be turning more concerned about the prospects for growth in the developing economies china and india after they had been recently very upbeat about prospects there

2898536 think of me and release me from his mental harassment and hammering
2898537 the law defines almost any interpersonal maladjustment as domestic violence the courts then establish procedures to expedite the issuance of these orders
2898538 he has a long history of verbal and emotional abuse
2898539 in divorce and child custody cases a party generally obtains favorable treatment when the other party has engaged in domestic violence
2898540 which includes reasonable apprehension of physical harm and creating fear of physical harm by harassment psychological abuse could impact the parenting plan approved by the family court
2898541 parent must have repeatedly made fraudulent reports of domestic violence or child abuse
2898542 the man now homeless and distraught has only a few days to find a lawyer and prepare a defense
2898543 domestic violence claims increased 466 from 1 065 to 6 029
2898544 in nonreciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators in more than 70 percent of the cases reciprocity was associated with more frequent violence among women but not men
2898545 women were slightly more likely than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently
2898546 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2898547 the violence against women act of 2005 contains groundbreaking new initiatives to help children exposed to violence train health care providers to support victims of abuse encourage men to teach the next generation that violence is wrong and provide crisis services for victims of rape and sexual assault

2898551 i dont know if hes postmus even in communication with anyone in the county
2898552 i had to rationalize that gabriel did something bad that he asked for it butler said talking about the incident more than two years later
2898553 i mean why would the cops do this there had to be something i didnt know but i found out later there was nothing gabriel had done nothing wrong
2898554 were patted down at a significantly higher rate than would be expected
2898555 im not convinced we have the trust and respect of the entire community
2898556 we as an organization were very very concerned about these numbers we have some issues we need to work on
2898557 it will give that agency the ability to monitor and promote a more effective police department
2898558 there are many positive signs that the changes we advocated and that they implemented are working to lower the dollar amounts of legal judgments and settlements against the department as well as improving community relations
2898559 is it just me or is your first reaction after turning on the news and hearing someone say we must try harder to understand islam to wonder oh god what did they blow up now
2898560 i know exactly where we are how did we get here
2898561 we reiterate our firm commitment to the project and are determined to move ahead in terms of land preparation and construction activities at full speed
2898562 unlike bauxite mines there is no shortage of iron ore mines as india exports more than one million tonnes the company can source raw materials on its own and can buy the same from the open market
2898563 its still complications from the knee injury that forced her to pull out of wimbledon
2898564 theres concern about being able to play potentially 11 matches on it
2898565 its doing a bit better ive been resting it since i hurt it at wimbledon
2898566 for me its a thrill to be back no matter what happens
2898567 organic produce tends to taste better most likely because of higher antioxidant levels which help it store long too
2898568 the whole world is on fire and where exactly is our congressional leadership eating ribs at an election bbq fundraiser or partying in beijing
2898569 how you handle it depends on the type of pet you have but some things apply to all pets and the type of travel you plan airplane or car
2898570 animals that travel via airplane must endure rough rugged travel in the luggage compartment that is cold and unmanned
2898571 in the summertime the luggage compartment can be hot with poor air ventilation while the plane awaits take off from the airport some people do not realize that their animals are handled by luggage handlers not flight attendants many times dogs cats and other animals that are transported in a carrier can experience rough treatment by luggage handlers because their carriers are mistaken for luggage and are unknowingly tossed around
2898572 sometimes you can let a dog or cat rest its head on your lap or lay on its blanket with recognizable scents to provide a sense of familiarity and comfort
2898573 it is also important to line the interior of the carrier with a blanket for additional comfort and secure the travel carrier to avoid excessive jarring and motion
2898574 i have taken road trips with a parrot on my shoulder a six foot boa constrictor on my lap and a dog resting on a blanket on the back seat its truly about making the animal comfortable and feel relaxed during the travel experience
2898575 it all depends on the temperament of the animal and if it is accustomed to riding in a vehicle
2898576 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2898577 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2898578 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2898579 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2898580 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2898581 its possible that there are differences in the results but its extremely improbable
2898582 this is still an open investigation so i cant go into details or provide you a description of samples
2898583 however we stand by our test results which demonstrated a genetic match to the serotype salmonella saintpaul in both samples of water used for irrigation and composite samples of serrano peppers
2898584 if i give you partial information im telling a half truth if im telling you a half truth then in the end im telling you a lie
2898585 its not the mexico you think of with the donkey pulling the plow
2898586 what makes this outbreak notable is the number of persons that have become sickened with this same strain
2898587 if its true we cant be selling that kind of produce
2898588 weve eaten peppers since i was a little girl and have never had a problem
2898589 its as if they were to tell us not to eat tortillas
2898590 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
2898591 micropolitics analyzed the process of policy formulation which makes allies of the various interest groups affected by change
2898592 i never hit him and it did not hurt anyway
2898593 were excited to introduce the new streamsend email marketing affiliate program
2898594 to survive in their positions by serving hidden selfish motives
2898595 we in the opposition should not only focus on removing this dictatorial government but also work hard to produce leaders who are resilient to bribes
2898596 we need leaders who have a desire to serve who are not in the opposition because they want to survive in their positions
2898597 i understand elections for guild president in makerere were determined by how many packets of waragi and how many avocados a candidate was able to distribute this is a big shame to the highest institution of learning in this country we need to nurture leaders who are resilient to temptations of bribery
2898598 as we move towards 2011 the urgent task we are facing is not only removing this regime but also nurturing our own leaders who have competency and love to serve the country
2898599 removing a dictatorship is a big task having a responsible government is probably the biggest one as we focus on removing a dictator we should keep a sharp eye on which kind of leaders in opposition we bring up to replace this regime
2898600 this gentleman you see here was shot and a bullet passed through his rib
2898601 but unfortunately we removed a dictator and replaced him with another dictator thats why we should be vigilant on the kind of leaders we in opposition have
2898602 true happiness in life comes from a continual process of readjusting our expectations
2898603 i give my permission to let go of the negativity of the past i give myself permission to let go and go beyond the fear
2898604 i dont want to eat that i dont want to eat that
2898605 be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies
2898606 you can only turn left so many times until you begin turning right
2898607 you know i need to stop doing this this is not serving me its not helping me or anyone else im constantly in fear of moving forward
2898608 a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty
2898609 we must combine the toughness of a serpent with the softness of a dove a tough mind a tender heart

2898618 los espa oles no hablan mejor que nosotros hablan m s alto
2898619 s es un pa s atrasado pero me gusta aunque muchos digan que los moros son muy distintos de nosotros y que no te puedes fiar de ellos si les educas un poco te son fieles y se portan bien fig rese que en casa tengo a una morita del norte que habla espa ol la pobre no sab a ni jota de nuestra cocina ni de nuestras costumbres y he debido ense rselo todo c mo guisar lavar la ropa en la lavadora servir la mesa si no le dices haz esto y eso y aquello se queda sentada en un rinc n con la fatalidad de esa gente pero es limpia y muy escrupulosa con el dinero de la compra a veces me olvido el monedero en casa y nunca me ha faltado nada
2898620 debe vd saber que la espa ola no es holgazana sino dura al trabajo sic y no se queja de l sobre todo si se siente en confianza no se inquiete si un d a encuentra su cocina invadida por un grupo de amigos o parientes espa oles reci n llegados a francia sin nada para comer ni d nde dormir pero sobre todo no piense que tiene que hospedar a la fuerza a toda espa a y que los espa oles son unos invasores y unos frescos
2898621 el espa ol tiene el sentido del deber y no el de la reivindicaci n tan querido del franc s en general no se queja y acepta su condici n con esa fatalidad heredada de la ocupaci n rabe
2898622 no intente tampoco discutir y razonar utilizando su l gica deductiva francesa en la mayor a de los casos el espa ol no le comprender pues es m s bien intuitivo
2898623 con buena voluntad de las dos partes para adaptarse para aceptar mutuamente las diferencias de mentalidad tendr en su casa a una empleada espa ola fiel trabajadora y alegre
2898624 el trabajo de la empleada espa ola consistir en hacer la cocina cotidiana y los platos franceses m s corrientes es necesario que en adelante aqu lla se olvide de las costumbres espa olas muy diferentes de las nuestras y no se acuerde de ellas sino el d a en que la familia francesa vida de novedad y folclore le pedir de sic hacer un plato espa ol t pico el franc s tiene un privilegio o una pega con respecto a las otras naciones tiene un h gado cu delo y conserve intacto este rgano al cual sic nos interesamos tanto no querernos decir con esto que la cocina espa ola sea incomible ni menospreciada en francia lejos de nosotros tal afirmaci n que ser a contraria a la realidad y a nuestros propios gustos pero el franc s est muy orgulloso de la reputaci n de su cocina y se muestra puntilloso en preservarla

2898640 essentially the money has kind of vanished in thin air
2898641 nobody is fussing about whether this is a good monument to have
2898642 but as you can well imagine theres no shortage of organizations that would like to have a presence on the national mall
2898643 commemorative work for which a site was approved prior to the date of enactment of this title
2898644 this memorial will help to complete the story told on the national mall of the birth of the nation

2898653 the students have worked very hard on this project and wanted to present the soldiers with a little piece of home
2898654 they were very excited to visit the base but more importantly to meet the soldiers who represent their country
2898655 i am very impressed by the initiative from these students our base embraces all opportunities that develop relationships with the surrounding communities this was an incredible chance for these high school students to interact with soldiers not much older than themselves who are training for deployment to afghanistan

2898678 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2898679 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2898680 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2898681 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2898682 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2898683 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2898684 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2898685 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2898686 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2898687 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2898688 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2898689 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
2898690 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
2898691 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
2898692 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
2898693 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
2898694 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
2898695 father forgive them for they know not what they do

2898707 we are confident that the suspects under detention are connected with the killing
2898708 very regrettable that the attacks have happened after the cases of attacks against journalists have gone down last year
2898709 i do not understand why the killings continue this shows the prevalence of a culture of violence
2898710 it is with great distress that the ifj reports that roxas murder and the attack on cuesta have seen the philippines return to the top of the most dangerous countries in the asia pacific region for journalists so far in 2008
2898711 only through public condemnation and the active pursuit of justice will authorities send a clear message that such heinous attacks will not be tolerated
2898712 two attacks against outspoken radio commentators in the space of a week is of grave concern to us and our colleagues in the philippines
2898713 for nearly two years we saw a lull in journalist killings these two attacks and the murder of columnist benefredo acabal in april are an alarming sign that violence against philippine journalists may be on the rise we send our condolences to roxas family and urge authorities to bring justice swiftly
2898714 i call on the police force of roxas city to immediately get to the bottom of this case and bring the perpetrators to justice this is the first time such an atrocity against the media has happened in roxas city
2898715 the csc office was flooded neck deep on june 21 after the flood subsided it left knee high mud which ruined our files and all our office equipment we have to re set the examinations as some application forms were completely destroyed and we are still calling for those applicants to refile again
2898716 the same requirements are needed 4 pictures measuring 1 5 by 2 inches with white background and nametag which are not computerized or taken digitally and an id photocopy for applicants whose ids were destroyed by the flood we advise them to get a postal id as replacement a photocopy of the new id should be submitted to us
2898717 i directed all cops to launch three police operations per week more police operations will mean more accomplishments and will eventually lead to higher performance rating for the 2nd semester of 2008 he was quoted in a cppo press release
2898718 hot meat and the entry of meat coming from unaccredited slaughterhouses into the city
2898719 an ordinance establishing guidelines and polices in the apprehension of illegally slaughtered animals in the city of bacolod creating a task force body for its implementation and providing penalties thereof
2898720 we have been charged with many accusations in the past and now is the time where the perpetrators themselves whom we had filed charges had volunteered to give their testimonies to end the abuse of our forest especially in the bulabog puti an national park and the mountains of dingle
2898721 he is not involved in any way in the cutting of the narra tree and the allegations against him are false
2898722 there are signs of recovery but further sampling and monitoring are necessary to provide solid evidence of full recovery of plants and animals
2898723 this indicates the mangroves recovery and coping to the stress
2898724 my work is to do research as the college is upgrading itself always
2898725 i love working with tnt most of all the product is really good theres the quality of the paper balanced news varied topics making it interactive with readers and theres support from the management ms marichel magalona managing director accommodates all my requests

2898734 seriously folks dont burn your copies of the book return them
2898735 i think meyers fans would send a much more powerful message if instead of a book burning tour they staged a book returning tour
2898736 not only is this girl seriously melodramatic and clumsy shes the most weak willed and pathetic character ever written
2898737 she has said numerous times that she would die if edward ever left her its like her entire world revolves around him what are you trying to tell young women ms meyer dont girls have enough self esteem problems already should they really be reading books about a girl who has no life outside of her boyfriend a girl who readily admits that she would die if he were to ever leave her
2898738 i think most readers would have settled for a surprise pregnancy at the end or something to that effect if meyer really wanted a baby in this story but the fact that it swallowed the whole plot just plain sucks
2898739 i was extremely disappointed with the fourth book i want my money back
2898740 i wanted him like i wanted air to breathe bella says in the book upon discovering shes carrying a male vampire who might kill her if she carries him to term
2898741 this creepy anti abortion allegory quickly gets literal as the half vampire fetus starts killing bella from the inside out even as it breaks her ribs and sucks the life from her she proclaims i wont kill him but does she have to face the consequences of this choice no because vampire magic suddenly allows mother and father to hear the fetus thoughts and to discover that it already loves them
2898742 with a book as eagerly anticipated as breaking dawn there are going to be diverse reactions
2898743 stephenie meyers fans are incredibly passionate about her books so its no surprise that readers respond with equal passion
2898744 if the military confrontation over the border dispute near preah vihear temple continues the two countries will lose economic advantages including revenues from tourism
2898745 thailand wishes to find a solution to the issue of the temple of preah vihear in a peaceful and amicable manner making full use of the existing bilateral mechanisms including meetings between the two foreign ministers the thai cambodian joint boundary commission jbc and the general border committee gbc
2898746 differences of views on boundary issues between two neighboring countries are not unusual
2898747 this issue is just one small part of the overall relations between thailand and cambodia

2898751 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
2898752 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development

2898772 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2898773 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2898774 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2898777 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2898778 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2898779 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2898780 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2898781 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2898782 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2898783 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2898784 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2898792 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2898793 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2898794 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2898795 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2898796 this new upgrade in technology is an important step in giving students the assistance they require

2898800 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2898801 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2898802 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2898803 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2898804 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2898805 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2898806 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2898807 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2898808 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2898809 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2898810 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2898811 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2898812 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2898813 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2898814 an exemplary christian college with an integrated curriculum of liberal arts and professional studies shaped by a caring people committed to biblical precepts and values
2898815 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2898816 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2898817 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2898818 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2898819 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2898820 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2898821 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2898822 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2898823 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2898824 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2898825 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2898826 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2898827 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2898828 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2898829 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2898830 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2898831 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2898832 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2898833 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2898834 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2898835 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2898836 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2898837 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2898838 i learned that we have a great group of guys guys that are working hard taking pride in doing things right

2898874 people hardly batted an eyelid when amanda beard appeared in playboy but 10 or 15 years ago this would have caused much more of an uproar in the united states
2898875 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2898876 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2898899 have i ever gone crazy after playing with all those sounds absolutely all the time im left alone too much of the time and id put on explosions and go boom boom boom all day long
2898900 as a child ive always loved recording movies and tv shows and then listening to them i got very involved and interested in how sounds and images worked together how sound could dramatise a story
2898901 i was never interested in radio which was just sound alone i was more interested in sound and pictures happening at the same time because there is obviously a relationship between them that fascinated me
2898902 its a great concept of a movie its like a silent movie because it relies on visual language the tilt of the head the angle of the binoculars all those little things tell you something about the characters viewpoint
2898903 and then the sound is there to really convince you that wall e is a machine and is capable of doing what youre seeing
2898904 i started three years ago when there wasnt even a script for the movie yet it was just andrew with a lot of uncompleted ideas in his head
2898905 we had some sketches and artwork that showed maybe what the character would look like and andrew would describe the character to me and what he thought his personality was like
2898906 for instance wall e is a cute lovable character but curious frightened and capable of falling in love and that would be enough for me to get started
2898907 andrew is a big fan of star wars and we did talk about r2 d2 a lot obviously because artoo is basically the best example of a robot that can communicate his feelings without using any words
2898908 the difference between artoo and wall e is that artoo had the advantage of always having c 3po with him so if artoo went beep beep beep c 3po would then go artoo says the force field needs to be turned off at the death star
2898909 but wall e didnt have a c 3po so i had to go deeper into his expressions to make sure the audience would understand what was going on i knew that it could work i just didnt know what kind of sounds would work for him
2898910 andrew liked that because it sounded like synthetic speech and thats what we wanted creating this idea that the characters were machines we wanted to make the sound seem as if it were really coming out of the device
2898911 i suppose we could have recorded actors and just dubbed their voices in but you would have lost the depth and sense of reality that these are talking devices imagine if that thing points to a voice recorder on the table could talk it wouldnt sound like liam neeson

2898914 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2898915 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2898916 he uses philosophy psychology and the intuitive to find resolutions that move people back into alignment with the universe and into a place of peace harmony and joy
2898917 bob uses the intuitive to help people with a variety of life issues including relationships career and health
2898918 his knowledge of the past and the future helps people find balance in the present
2898919 he is able to separate out surrounding negative energy which allows people to have a clearer perception of their own options and choices
2898920 i said whats the purpose of the meeting and the bottom line was that he said the purpose of the meeting was she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk wanted me to talk to him and to her about what their circumstances were
2898921 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2898922 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2898923 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2898924 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2898925 public transport use in sydney had steadily declined between 2000 and 2005 but the sharp rise in fuel costs forced commuters onto trains between 2005 and 2007 the number of train journeys jumped by 11 million
2898926 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2898927 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2898928 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now
2898929 i think he feeds off it and uses it to his advantage
2898930 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2898931 what kind of results do you expect to see and in what timeframe
2898932 im pretty sure those posts could have been about anything and would still have been given the 1 5 mark
2898933 if you have an idea and are willing to pay for it lets talk
2898934 this basically minimises their work and dumps all the admin onto us
2898935 well have to see if we played technique really really well
2898936 i think we flew around and had a lot of energy
2898937 the major thing is that this year i had to come back and prove i can be a guy we can go to big plays jump balls running after the catch
2898938 so far i have shown the coaches i can do that
2898939 if you dont feel that you played well as a unit typically youre not dominating people up front
2898940 hopefully well break the record by a little more in the final
2898941 if i dont get on the night relay it would be kind of devastating but i believe in the coaches and if it doesnt work out that way hey ive always got 2012 and the olympics in london
2898942 well see where they are tomorrow its still an evaluation stage were going to take a good look at this tape and see where we go with the quarterbacks
2898943 we were in much better position we put pressure on the quarterback all day long and those are good things
2898944 ive been a duke fan for the past forty some years and ive been waiting for someone since steve spurrier to come in and turn around this program
2898945 i went to their spring game and i liked what i saw i just like his enthusiasm and i like the way he has the kids involved in the community
2898946 ive been a season ticket holder for 25 years and ive suffered a little
2898947 when i heard he was coming i have been his biggest cheerleader
2898948 he wants to go to a bowl game and he can do that with his enthusiasm his coaching ability just the good person he is he can do that we can do it
2898949 you could bring in uscs football coach you could bring in floridas coach it doesnt matter who you bring in nobody would be bigger than coach k

2898979 johnson amp johnsons topamax may increase the risk of birth defects in a small study 203 patients scientists found a 14 fold increase in the risk of birth defects the risk appeared to be higher among patients who took topamax in combination with valproate depakote or other epilepsy meds
2898980 they didnt mention off label use of topamax sometimes in combination with valproate for bipolar disorder but presumably those patients ought to discuss with their doctors too
2898981 of the 203 pregnancies 18 ended in spontaneous abortions two in stillbirths and five in induced abortions of the 178 babies born 16 had major birth defects in three of those cases the mothers had taken only topiramate and in the other 13 the mothers had taken it in combination with other drugs four of the babies had cleft palates or lips a rate 11 times the normal rate of 1 in 500 expected among women not taking epilepsy drugs four male babies had genital birth defects which is 14 times the normal rate of 1 in 300

2898991 when we heard about her circumstances the terri schindler schiavo foundation immediately sprang into action
2898992 we helped the family find the right legal counsel and after days of hard work and persistence the court finally intervened and stopped this terrible travesty
2898993 what makes these circumstances so important is that unlike my sister terri where we were fighting a husband who didnt care janet riveras husband wanted her to live so did her entire family
2898994 not long ago i interviewed both brenden and his mother
2898995 people like brenden janet and my sister terri are why the terri schindler schiavo foundation exists

2898997 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools
2898998 every may 22 ab 2567 will positively portray to children homosexual experimentation homosexual marriages sex change operations and anything else thats in the closet gov schwarzenegger should say no to this very inappropriate bill which has nothing to do with academic excellences
2898999 when fully implemented sb 777 and ab 394 will teach children in california government schools to support homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality via instructional materials programs and activities and school safety guidelines
2899000 in addition the california state school board this year implemented sb 71 requiring public schools that provide sex education to promote unmarried sexual activity with no restraints other than mutual consent
2899001 ab 2567 will further motivate parents to remove their children from the immoral public school system
2899002 with public schools becoming sexual indoctrination centers homeschooling and church schools are no longer parental options theyre parental imperatives
2899003 this is yet another example of the campaign to normalize homosexual behavior not just in schools but in our culture
2899004 young children will be forced to celebrate the life of a man whose claim to fame is his sexual orientation
2899005 parents should be outraged that californias lawmakers want their children to spend a whole day celebrating homosexuality instead of studying important subjects like math or science
2899006 every parent and student should call governor schwarzenegger and tell him to veto ab 2567

2899010 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom
2899011 the issue before the voters is whether or not california should define marriage as between one man and one woman
2899012 and rather than presenting it that way to the voters the attorney general got political with it
2899013 the attorney general is required by law to provide an objective summary of what the proposition would do to the law
2899014 in this case the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry even if the initiative also has other purposes and effects
2899015 the attorney generals title is an accurate statement of the primary purpose and effect of the measure it is not argumentative or inherently prejudicial
2899016 provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2899017 this is an emergency petition to try to get the court to order the attorney general to provide a sic unbiased ballot title and summary before the ballots are begun to be printed here in california which starts next week
2899018 what the california supreme court essentially ruled was that you cant hold gay and straight couples to two different legal standards that if a straight couple has a
2899019 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
2899020 the court in its new decision concluded that homeschools may constitute private schools but it added that the right of homeschoolinng can be overridden if a childs safety is at issue

2899025 you cant blame a criminal for committing more crimes after being given a free pass but you can blame suttons win at all costs arrogance and despicable judgment for totally destroying the lives of two heroic border agents for doing their jobs
2899026 there is no question the fallout from suttons prosecutorial overreach in the ramos and compean case has already caused immeasurable harm to the efforts and morale of the men and women of not only the border patrol but all law enforcement
2899027 governor paterson is overstepping his authority and the democratic process by issuing a directive at odds with new york public policy on marriage
2899028 ensure that terms such as spouse husband and wife are construed in a manner that encompasses legal same sex marriages
2899029 we both believe in jesus but who decides whose morals are correct
2899030 what about people who dont believe in the bible at all are they not allowed to talk about morals because they must not have a moral compass
2899031 the whole world is on fire and where exactly is our congressional leadership eating ribs at an election bbq fundraiser or partying in beijing

2899034 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2899035 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2899036 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2899037 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2899038 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2899039 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2899040 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2899041 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2899042 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2899043 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2899044 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2899045 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2899046 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2899047 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2899048 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2899049 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2899050 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2899051 he was following the guidance perfectly but at 1 000ft andrew turned away from the target landing area and became slumped in his harness
2899052 he hung forward his head was bowed and his arms were hanging straight down the instructor repeated his instruction to the student to turn left to come back to the zone there was no response
2899053 there was no physical evidence there were no bones broken there wasnt a mark on him
2899054 the vast slew of modern buildings are so prosaic so dull so cheap they are just blots on the landscape skid marks lacerating our topography and geography paris and rome are like supermodels in comparison
2899055 i own this unit and paid around 250 not long ago after extensive research on aviscience com bought it because most of my dvds are standard definition and it works like magic upscaling to 1080p for my 1080p sony bravia vw60 projector it is just a step below hd stations i watch on tv that are broadcast in 720p the faroudja chip is known in the industry and so if you need something to watch your sd dvds on i highly recommend this i plan on getting a blue ray player later when the disc prices come down a bit until then we like the quality of video on this machine and would still rather buy cheap dvds or rent them for 1 from redbox on the oppo hd981 than go to the theater hard to believe it can produce as much detail as it does with with so low resolution dvds no quality problems here
2899056 i think in china it has to be this way
2899057 we feel more assured that as a western tourist you are not in danger
2899058 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2899059 this grant should help us immeasurably toward our goal of translating research into improved survival in five years
2899060 specifically we hope itll lead to the development of a unique agent against the disease
2899061 its possible that there are differences but its extremely improbable
2899062 this is still an open investigation so i cant go into details or provide you a description of samples
2899063 however we stand by our test results which demonstrated a genetic match to the serotype salmonella saintpaul in both samples of water used for irrigation and composite samples of serrano peppers
2899064 its not the mexico you think of with the donkey pulling the plow
2899065 what makes this outbreak notable is the number of persons that has become sickened with this same strain
2899066 weve eaten peppers since i was a little girl and have never had a problem
2899067 its as if they were to tell us not to eat tortillas

2899069 i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not what can i say the harder i tried the worse it got i havent got the focus this week im just not with it obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2899070 there was no sort of anything but knocking it in the hole
2899071 and i kind of felt i had won the pga at that stage
2899072 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back

2899074 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
2899075 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac
2899076 they said shaft was a relentless character and it had to denote some kind of action or drama
2899077 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2899078 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2899079 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2899080 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close

2899083 our first quarter of 2009 was highlighted by the commissioning of our ezulwini mine gold plant and the production of gold in july as planned
2899084 although the final commissioning stages of the uranium plant at the ezulwini mine have been delayed until october 2008 as a result of the late delivery of certain equipment we believe that this will not affect our planned production for the fiscal year as the capacity of the mills and the uranium plant will exceed the planned near term capability of the mine to produce ore
2899085 at mws we made significant operational improvements during q1 2009 which enhanced gold production during q2 2009 we expect to operate the mws gold plant at designed throughput and recovery rates uranium production is expected in q3 2009 at the ezulwini mine and q4 2009 at mws
2899086 he had this fabulous smile and a great twinkle in his eyes
2899087 the first thought that went through my mind when i met him was uh oh stay away from that one
2899088 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
2899089 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
2899090 when you care for someone with anything like this you have to be on such an intimate level that a lot of people cant handle it and walk away with the care that i give him your guard has to be totally down and you have to be totally open all i know is i cant imagine being with anyone else and feeling as strong for them as i do for this man
2899091 there are a lot of disabled people in this boat who love each other and want to be together
2899092 as long as were ok with god we dont care what the government thinks
2899093 he just has this personality that completely shines through everything
2899094 when people tried to talk me out of this i had a simple answer
2899095 can you do that again and maybe put the stuff together faster
2899096 call aunt mary shell let us fill in the blank
2899097 not much of a summer home as these monsters go today our little place at the lake was a modest refuge for a young family without great room spa gymnasium racquetball room media center or wine cellar but i learned to hunt at our familys cabin to boat there to swim and water ski there and fish there to dive there to build things with my father out of wood and stone and quite accidentally i learned a lot about the world from a girl named bubbles
2899098 no one remembers the name of the burn victim but he was all wrapped up in gauze like a mummy his eyes werent covered though and the poor guy did have one free hand so bobo dealt him in
2899099 the day i entered that front door of the newspaper i think i knew id never leave this place
2899100 don was a really aggressive reporter but he was always searching for the angle that nobody else had
2899101 when he was around the city hall beat was always fun
2899102 he was the classiest warmest human being you could ever know
2899103 he was a hell of a lot of fun one of the nicest people ive ever known decency personified
2899104 i knew he wanted to be a columnist and i knew he had the talent
2899105 it didnt take great observational skills to know that he was a hell of a writer and knew the town better than anybody there wasnt anybody better around
2899106 he was the epitome of the philosophy of telling big stories in small ways
2899107 when other reporters turned to big shots and politicians for their sources don would turn to the little guys to tell their stories
2899108 more than anything st paul has lost its premier storyteller
2899109 he taught us history and we didnt know it because it was so fascinating in the way he told it
2899110 thats how we first met i was 16 he was 17 remember that song with us it happened
2899111 he loved his job so much that we often made fun of him by saying some people work for a living
2899112 he once said he could write a whole book about ashby
2899113 a knack for knowing things stories about st paul neighborhoods and beyond
2899114 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2899115 when i go out on that football field i want to be running 100 mph with no restrictions thats what i am trying to accomplish being on the sidelines getting healthy and going out and being explosive and jumping up in the air and catching ball
2899116 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2899117 he looked poised for a young guy and mike has to be happy with his quarterback coming out and looking fairly sharp
2899118 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2899119 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2899120 being a young player you darn near lose your breath before even the first snap of practice
2899121 i get in at 6 30 in the morning every time i get in and warm my body up i get on the bike in the hot whirlpool when i was younger i would just come in and get taped and go practice the older ive gotten its advantageous to get my body warmed up
2899122 being around 11 years myself you already know what to expect coming into camp you know its going to be long you know its going to be hard its a grind you have to get through it you have to be mentally focused you have to be mentally strong coaches are yelling at you players are coming at you rookies theyre not used to doing something like this
2899123 fiis move was based on a macro perspective indian mfs bet high on large caps as they are anytime preferred over mid caps or small caps in a declining market scenario large caps are more stable and the impact cost is lower
2899124 mostly this is sentimentally driven now mid caps seems to a little risky in this volatile market so most of them are investing in certain sector wise sensex companies which seems to be insulated from the shock
2899125 also mf companies got a better valuation on the large cap stocks in june quarter
2899126 pennsylvania vegetables are not transported thousands of miles across the country in refrigerated trucks which use a tremendous amount of high priced fossil fuels

2899141 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2899142 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2899143 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2899144 thats the point when my consciousness realized the work i was doing in the lab had real world consequences
2899145 until that happens to you you think youre in complete control theres no way on gods green earth im going to fall asleep because its too dangerous but the brain when sleep pressure gets to a certain point will seize control
2899146 it will become apparent that many children diagnosed with adhd have been misdiagnosed when the root cause is not enough sleep
2899147 he has been by far the leading researcher in the area of human circadian function and coupling that to sleep research
2899148 and he knows how to use that science in practical ways like the seminal study he did on factory schedules where he was able to significantly improve productivity whats amazing to me is that his ideas didnt catch on where everybody does it but were still operating in an ignorant society
2899149 when you realize how many things it affects it becomes clear that sleep is drastically undervalued
2899150 its low hanging fruit that would allow us to make progress in so many areas
2899151 quieren usar la plataforma de los juegos para ampliar los efectos
2899152 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2899153 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2899154 pode pensar eu consigo ou eu n o consigo estar certo em ambos os casos
2899155 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2899156 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2899157 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2899184 california democrat nancy pelosi may be trying to save the planet but the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides when it comes to gas prices as republicans apply more and more rhetorical muscle but what looks like intraparty tension on the surface is part of an intentional strategy in which pelosi takes the heat on energy policy while behind the scenes shes encouraging vulnerable democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically according to democratic aides on and off capitol hill
2899185 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2899186 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them

2899224 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2899225 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2899226 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2899227 the strengthening of the peacekeeping force is aimed at ruling out a repetition of the situation russian peacekeepers faced in tskhinvali
2899228 our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe
2899229 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2899230 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2899231 d c is probably democratizing the surrounding states because its steady gentrification has meant the steady out migration of blacks and immigrant minorities to the surrounding counties as a consequence maryland is even more heavily democratic and northern virginia with its growing ethnic minority population has pushed the state into the purple zone with the blue state imprimatur in the foreseeable future
2899232 our polling shows that although obama does decently up there
2899233 the kind of margins coming out of there for the democrats are not anything likely to be what you see in other statewide elections
2899234 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2899235 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2899236 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2899255 i read a disturbing article in the ny times last friday about dan kaminskys talk at the black hat conference hes been beating the drum for a while now warning of what sounds like a serious security hole in domain name server software offering an open door to hackers of websites containing confidential information and into email which could allow phishing for usernames and passwords for otherwise protected sites the technorati seem to agree that hes identified a serious problem and it seems that not all affected parts of the internet infrastructure have applied patches or upgraded their software
2899256 when secretary of health and human services mike leavitt announced here last month that our region had been selected as one of the four sites for medicares impending electronic health record demonstration project it was a huge coup for the local sponsor the pittsburgh regional health initiative and a reinforcement that pittsburgh is a national center of health care innovation
2899257 health researchers at the university of leeds have developed a website that encourages students to keep track of their drinking unitcheck encourages young people to check how many units they are consuming how this affects their health and how their drinking compares with that of their peers a pilot scheme funded by the european research advisory board found people who used the site drank approximately one unit less on each occasion they drank and that lower levels of alcohol consumption persisted over three months
2899258 there are more and more examples of how standard hacking techniques apply in healthcare with serious consequences recent issues include rfid hacking and interference issues recently a talk at blackhat regarding hacking medical devices including pacemakers has begun appearing in popular blogs what is most dangerous about this is not actually the hack itself but the fact that the hacks could become widespread think about it there is no real benefit to a hacker to simply kill a person it is a serious crime and unless there is something to gain by doing it it is unlikely to generate new interest with blackhat hackers

2899276 its a challenge for mid size cities to raise this kind of money for conventions like these
2899277 i think both the rnc and the dnc recognize they are going to have to find a way to do things a little differently in the future
2899278 there is some sincerity and some snake oil in every politician but john edwards exudes both in almost freakish measure
2899279 maybe slippery john somehow convinced earnest john that this moment would never come in fact it was inevitable and if edwards had somehow won the democratic nomination the party would be in the midst of a historic meltdown
2899280 the stunning admission edwards made to abcs bob woodruff and in a written statement from chapel hill on friday afternoon was that hes a narcissist
2899281 he admitted that wallowing in self focus out on the trail and thinking youre special can result in a solipsism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2899282 auto psychoanalysis by the perp thats really rich when bill clinton acknowledged an affair after equally adamant denials he simply went into an old fashioned spiral of penitence his allegedly long dark night of his alleged soul
2899283 even in confessing to preening edwards was preening his diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic or was it self narcissistic given his diagnosis im sure his h m o would pay
2899284 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct
2899285 hes not really very important in american politics right now but im afraid this will just deepen the cynicism that the american people feel towards politicians and politics

2899291 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
2899292 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
2899293 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
2899294 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into

2899600 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2899601 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar
2899602 the rba appears to be turning more concerned about the prospects for growth in the developing economies china and india after they had been recently very upbeat about prospects there
2899603 itunes could not install the ipod touch software upraged on the ipod because an unknown error occured 4
2899604 this isnt all that easy to do trust me took me quite a bit of time when i did this by my house on long island back sometime around 85 87 my kids did the same thing here one day and we had to have a neighbor teen to actually hook them over the line this was about 2 or 3 years ago what is interesting here is that these are two different shoes
2899605 this is the description the coen brothers description of my character

2899608 i havent seen the film yet but it was fun
2899609 there are 17 million people in the u s with diabetes with about a million more diagnosed each year
2899610 its not increasing as fast as diabetes care because theres just a limited pool of people who use them
2899611 but when push came to shove they didnt want to pay the 15 for it when they could get their cholesterol checked the next time they went to the doctor its just not urgent
2899612 what i see is an increase in is people buying blood pressure monitors
2899613 patients are becoming more aware of their health and starting to take control of things at home
2899614 unlike with diabetes you dont feel any symptoms of high blood pressure its up to you to keep track of it on a regular basis
2899615 i would take the results you get with a healthy dose of skepticism
2899616 patients could have a lot of fears about the results and there might be some questions they have that remain unanswered pre and post testing
2899617 i have it here more for convenience just in case anyone wants it
2899618 people just didnt get too crazy about having to handle fecal matter
2899619 theres a heavy ad expense for these companies and that has hindered development
2899620 for chronic diseases like diabetes kit tests are not enough
2899621 periodic measurements have to be taken and in order for the health system to care for the expanding number of people with these diseases we need to have something that can take the load off physicians
2899622 if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2899623 sir this is a lecture why dont you sit down and listen

2899627 it doesnt seem like we make these kinds of mistakes at home
2899628 this is a tough one to take we had chances to score runs throwing to the wrong base just stupid stuff
2899629 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
2899630 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2899631 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2899632 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2899633 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2899634 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency

2899637 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2899638 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2899639 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
2899640 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
2899641 the take home message here is its a big deal
2899642 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2899643 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2899644 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2899645 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2899646 secret invasion is a good story at heart but i think its a quick fix to problems created by multiple back to back crossovers which have created fan backlash and have alienated long time fans
2899647 i really like all the reveals and i think after its all over ill have a better understanding of the marvel universe

2899652 i said this violence is unacceptable inot only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin i have said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
2899653 the third step for a de escalation would be the withdrawal of all troops on both sides but a withdrawal accompanied by observers
2899654 we just let our swimming do the talking we didnt react to it it just got us fired up
2899655 then as i walked out i felt this amazing sense of calm come over me
2899656 to come out with not only a gold medal but a personal best in these circumstances is really more than i could have dreamed of
2899657 this is what i have been hoping for and i won with that time when i saw the screen i thought it said 59 90 and i though it was terribly slow but i checked it again and it was 58
2899658 when i went into the race i was not thinking of breaking the world record i just wanted to have a good swim
2899659 i am just very happy with my life at the moment my parents are here my boyfriend is here and that just helps me swim fast
2899660 he was all upset and then he was like laughing it was like an act to be honest

2899676 capital investment in hotels looked compelling on paper with the tax breaks available but underlying businesses need to be profitable to survive many developers invested in or built hotels using earnings from their long time buoyant housing or contracting businesses
2899677 looking at averages is too superficial for all of these markets american visitors to ireland tend to be affluent and crucially older than those from other markets they may be affected by a negative wealth effect but their disposable income is probably not being pinched as much as british visitors for example british visitors tend to be younger and stay for shorter periods particularly for weekend breaks
2899678 we cannot forget domestic issues either the market for irish tourists who stay at home is sizeable it grew a massive 60 to 1 55bn in the four years to 2007 unfortunately the economy is in recession retail sales have dropped 6 since the end of last year it is hard to see how growth can be generated from domestic holidaymakers in the short term
2899679 tax incentives for hotel development have been generous in effect many investors could claw back income tax at their marginal rate at the end of seven years
2899680 one problem is that as the lock up period ends the supply of hotels for sale is set to rise significantly due to the amount of building over the past ten years sales are problematic because there isnt much of a bid in any segment of the property market right now
2899681 a man can receive only what is given him from heaven

2899686 people assumed that evidence of the power of god was he missing element of effective evangelism
2899687 as an introduction to most of the parables matthew 13 of course the lords claim to kingship was the point of acrimony that pilate could not avoid and the jewish leaders backed him against a wall and forced him to release barabbas instead of jesus john 18 and 19
2899688 god helped me to kick destructive habits that were destroying my life
2899689 god gave me a higher calling to help this needy world
2899690 for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened
2899691 i think all of us agree that corporal punishment has no place in education
2899692 for one thing it is not an effective means of punishing children
2899693 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2899694 in the time ive been in custody my business has been destroyed
2899695 to allow immigration agents to come into the federal and state courthouse and questioning people is really going to pose problems

2899700 ive been a duke fan for the past forty some years and ive been waiting for someone since steve spurrier to come in and turn around this program
2899701 i went to their spring game and i liked what i saw i just like his enthusiasm and i like the way he has the kids involved in the community
2899702 ive been a season ticket holder for 25 years and ive suffered a little
2899703 when i heard he was coming i have been his biggest cheerleader
2899704 he wants to go to a bowl game and he can do that with his enthusiasm his coaching ability just the good person he is he can do that we can do it
2899705 you could bring in uscs football coach you could bring in floridas coach it doesnt matter who you bring in nobody would be bigger than coach k
2899706 the rivalry actually has been pretty good lately because both teams have been so bad
2899707 a successful football program is not just going to be about the players
2899708 its going to be about you and i we cant do it without you guys
2899709 i didnt like the bare feet but something made me stay and i dont know what it was
2899710 we girls say lets line up and see whos going to get attacked first
2899711 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
2899712 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
2899713 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
2899714 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
2899715 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people
2899716 no matter what your party affiliation if someone from your town is successful you hate
2899717 to be involved in something like this my heart goes out to his wife
2899718 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2899719 but i think it would be more comfortable for a lot of people if it was left on plum island
2899720 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2899721 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking at in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2899722 in the course of the riot and as a result of it there was serious bodily injury including cuts bruises and mace inflicted on various of the approximately 300 individuals engaged in the disturbance
2899723 i found myself wondering if i could do better when i realized it was all coming together i knew i had to take it as far as i could but i never decided i was going to write for a living that just kind of happened
2899724 i thought he was the most natural storyteller i had seen in a long while
2899725 everything you want a good novel to be was in the american
2899726 look out tom clancy this guy is going to steal your spotlight
2899727 even after three books i still find myself questioning what im doing and i cant help but feel that it slows me down
2899728 if you havent had a baby in a while you get out of touch with whats new
2899729 the idea is really to support new parents at a critical juncture in a childs life
2899730 the early weeks and years of life are when their brain architecture is developing and it sets the foundation for their entire life
2899731 it makes me feel good because i already know how the babys supposed to be acting
2899732 there is some sincerity and some snake oil in every politician but john edwards exudes both in almost freakish measure
2899733 maybe slippery john somehow convinced earnest john that this moment would never come in fact it was inevitable and if edwards had somehow won the democratic nomination the party would be in the midst of a historic meltdown
2899734 the stunning admission edwards made to abcs bob woodruff and in a written statement from chapel hill on friday afternoon was that hes a narcissist
2899735 he admitted that wallowing in self focus out on the trail and thinking youre special can result in a solipsism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2899736 auto psychoanalysis by the perp thats really rich when bill clinton acknowledged an affair after equally adamant denials he simply went into an old fashioned spiral of penitence his allegedly long dark night of his alleged soul
2899737 even in confessing to preening edwards was preening his diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic or was it self narcissistic given his diagnosis im sure his h m o would pay
2899738 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct
2899739 hes not really very important in american politics right now but im afraid this will just deepen the cynicism that the american people feel towards politicians and politics
2899740 we look forward to a new chapter in the life of city government
2899741 the first day is kind of overwhelming no matter what job you take
2899742 absolutely the most professional city manager ive ever worked with
2899743 i heard he was real intent on making sure the folks driving him around took him to the disadvantaged areas the areas that are rough around the edges
2899744 he noticed a lot of things the city could have done better
2899745 it kind of drives me nuts if i cant come out here and shoot
2899746 its nice to come out here and forget about all those issues
2899747 i would surely buy sesa goa though there might be some volatility as it is in the nd period they have got their pricing almost through and the prices which other over suppliers have got this year have been about 65 to 80 more than last year so it is true that there is some skepticism about the continuance of the steel rally globally but sesa is in a very good wicket and they have been able to one of the few companies that are passed on these export duty totally to their customers so sesa could be a very bright spark in the commodity related space
2899748 between the composite sketch and the photo identification i had messed it up
2899749 by the time i got to the physical lineup ron cotton had become my attacker and that was that
2899750 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2899751 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2899752 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2899753 in the recent past sugar stocks have moved up considerably especially if you look at a stocks like sakthi sugars which is i think gone up by about 30 35 in the last one month so is the case of renuka sugars even for that matter balrampur so if you look at their charts right now they have all reach their intermediate resistance levels sakthi sugars has come up very strongly to about rs 110 and renuka is about rs 130 and whereas balrampur is at rs 93 these are all resistance levels so i expect some kind of a profit taking here it will consolidate at lower levels say balrampur at rs 84 85 sakthi around rs 100 97 and renuka around rs 120 and then a further move up could be possible but not from the current levels they can move up very fast
2899754 the q1fy09 results for tata chemicals consolidated were above our expectations in term of net sales net sales increased by 93 yoy and 50 qoq to rs 21 923 5 million against our expectations of rs 14 353 6 million the revenues show robust performance due to higher revenues reported on standalone basis of rs 12 073 7 million as against our expectations of rs 8 377 6 million
2899755 the consolidated net sales and net profit of tata chemicals is expected to grow at cagr of 29 4 and 37 4 during fy08 10 on the back of organic growth as well as inorganic growth at the current market price of rs 347 the stock is trading at 13 7xfy09e and 9 4xfy10e expected earnings we are increasing our target price from rs 391 to rs 441 due to consolidation of gcip numbers in our projection hence we maintain our buy rating on stock
2899756 i have a cat and shes the craziest creature on the planet

2899794 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
2899795 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
2899796 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs

2899799 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
