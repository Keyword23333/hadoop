1280005 in unserem land haben signale eine sehr gro e bedeutung gehen sie davon aus dass dieses signal jetzt gegeben wurde
1280006 we have a strong finnish tradition in the team and ive seen both mika and kimi take their first grand prix wins while driving for mclaren
1280007 with heikki yesterdays result was fully justified and very much deserved hes had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that hed let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1280008 and weve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling its something they want to keep doing
1280009 clearly we are targeting ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1280010 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from
1280011 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load
1280012 this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1280013 the reality is that you cant isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the cars performance
1280014 its a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost weve seen it happen before
1280015 we are undertaking two 50km shakedown tests ahead of valencia were also continually developing new parts for the car as our simulation and development departments continue to produce new parts well take a view as to whether theyll be raced we wont disclose what they are but im sure youll see some new components appear during friday testing at the next race
1280016 we tested the engine cover dorsal fin during the pre german grand prix test at hockenheim its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere
1280017 as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment
1280018 weve been paying very close attention to the construction of the new shorefront circuit in valencia and are convinced it is going to be an exciting addition to the formula one calendar and an absolutely top line facility

1280026 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is the young people of russia today understand less and less
1280027 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1280028 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1280029 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and

1280051 the continuity we find in india over the last three thousand years
1280052 it is my deliberate opinion that india is being ground down not under the english heels but under that of modern civilization
1280053 we can accommodate them only there is no room for their civilization
1280054 indian society to be formed out of many diverse and even discordant elements
1280055 we can see that the aim of bharatavarsha has always been to establish unity amidst differences to bring diverse paths to a convergence and to internalize within her soul the unity within severalty that is to say to comprehend the inner unity of externally perceptible differences without eliminating the uniqueness of each element
1280056 the modern indian village gives an unspeakable impression of the grimmest poverty and helplessness
1280057 the surplus taken away from people who live in such misery and degradation nevertheless provided and still provides the material foundation for indian culture and civilization
1280058 brahmanism thus gave some unity to what would have been social fragments without a common bond the process was of crucial importance in the history of india first in developing the country from tribe to society and then holding it back bogged down in the filthy swamp of superstition
1280059 what is this india apart from her physical and geographical aspects
1280060 disruptive tendencies gave rise immediately to attempts to find a synthesis some kind of a dream of unity has occupied the mind of india since the dawn of civilization
1280061 a cultural unity amidst diversity a bundle of contradictions held together by strong but invisible threads she is a myth and an idea a dream and a vision and yet very real and present and pervasive

1280068 the institution of the family cannot be taken for granted
1280069 being is a delusion which traps desire in the snare of representation and therby represses it thier goal is to release desire from being so it can enter more freely into becoming

1280076 stop taking supplements of vitamins a e and beta carotene plain and simple
1280077 vitamin supplements are extraordinarily safe and effective this is based on fifty years of clinical experience without seeing any life threatening side effects and no deaths it is pharmaceutical drugs that are dangerous perhaps the drug industry is getting tired of all the bad news about drugs so instead they are going after nutritional supplements
1280078 for 33 years i have aggressively prescribed and advocated vitamins in doses vastly higher than the usual government recommendations for my family and my patients i have never seen any adverse reactions even though i have been on the alert for them all this time
1280079 must be safe for consideration as over the counter products health canada ensures that all canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe effective and of high quality
1280080 in decades of people taking a wide variety of dietary supplements few adverse effects have been noted and zero deaths as a result of the dietary supplements there is far more risk to public health from people stopping their vitamin supplements than from people taking them
1280081 i couldnt lie so i said he was my husband
1280082 eventually they let me go to the toilet but this one guy came with me he opened the door while i was on the toilet he said to me take off your clothes i cant even tell my husband what happened to me next it was horrible after he abused me i told them that i was pregnant they said i could go back to my area in harare but i had to report to the police station every day they confiscated all my documents
1280083 i cant go back to zimbabwe they are looking for me i was so scared that i was going to give birth in zimbabwe there is nothing there no food on the shelves the situation is just so terrible when i arrived back at gatwick i was so relieved i said thank goodness

1280085 cancelled a planned short visit to the ramstein and landstuhl u s military bases in the southwest german state of rhineland palatinate the visits were planned for friday
1280086 during his trip as part of the codel to afghanistan and iraq sen obama visited the combat support hospital in the green zone in baghdad and had a number of other visits with the troops for the second part of his trip the senator wanted to visit the men and women at landstuhl regional medical center to express his gratitude for their service and sacrifice the senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
1280087 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280088 we learned from the pentagon last night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event
1280089 sen obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perveived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go
1280090 if mccain wants his op ed printed he needs to follow the new york times edit instructions that accompanied his script when the returned it or are you saying that only obama is required to follow the new york times format guidelines for op ed submissions
1280091 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troops levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan
1280092 because he sen mccain wont provide an op ed to the new york times outlining same as obama did that i may read it for myself
1280093 it was the senator who decided that leaving the campaign staff behind was less acceptable than visiting wounded us troops with his senate staff
1280094 the pentagon did in fact tell obama that in this case it was not only
1280095 we have longstanding department of defense policy in regards to political campaigns and elections
1280096 we informed the obama staff that he was more than welcome to visit as senator obama with senate staff however he could not conduct the visit with campaign staff
1280097 wouldnt you think that a senator serving on the veterans affairs committee would be anxious to meet with the
1280098 once the pentagon got involved obama had to follow their
1280099 the pentagon in a statement cited longstanding defense department policy that prohibits military personnel or facilities from association with partisan political campaigns and elections
1280100 we told him he could visit landstuhl regional medical center in western germany with his senate staff but not with his campaign staff
1280101 i would rather lose an election than lose a war my opponent would rather lose a war than a political campaign
1280102 he visited the hospitals and meet with wounded troops in afgan and iraq with no photos and no press
1280103 if obama had gone to see the wounded troops then you and mccain
1280104 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280105 the candidate made a surprise pop in to a dinner with the traveling press corps and his campaign staff in downtown berlin and had a celebratory vodka martini olives very dry
1280106 instead of such immense profits going to a single corporation
1280107 there is no justifiable excuse for not visiting our american service members who have been wounded in a combat zone
1280108 i dont want a perfect top of his class elitist candidate
1280109 some of these postings are hilarious obama defamers are so transparent in their green envy
1280110 this change is the change weve been waiting to change that has been my position all along and our campaign is proud to be here with you tonight
1280111 he is a true leader and even foreigners are able to discern that
1280112 do your duty as an american and learn before you use your judgement and your vote
1280113 he obama was more than welcome we were all ready for him
1280114 he obama was more than welcome we were all ready for him
1280115 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states
1280116 obama is a us senator he could have gone to the hospital without the cameras
1280117 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280118 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280119 the staff discussions came as the pentagon recently updated a military directive spelling out restrictions on the u s military during political campaigning candidates for office have long been prohibited from engaging in political activities at u s military installations or using u s military personnel in their political appearances presidential campaign staffs generally are very familiar with these military rules
1280120 it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280121 well at least he did provide them with a great college tuition plan and hes trying to get elected so he can get them out of iraq
1280122 remember when candidates were off limits when they went overseas john mccain apparently doesnt even though he claimed this time and time again oh well mccain is behaving like a child because he knows hes already dead in the water good riddance john hopefully the third time you sell your soul will be the magic number
1280123 hmmmm a man leading the united states that is actually respected and listened to by the world and hes respected for something other than threats of war and destruction many people on here are sounding very scared of such a thing scared of someone really smart and one that uses his mind as a weapon more powerful than bombs might lead the way we once did plus there is a thinly disguised veil of racism going on too thats very sad
1280124 so far his campaign manager who whereever has not spoken of the reason he turned it down did they we as the american people need to find this out eventually it may comebarack amp bite him o we need to get to the bottom of it amp leak it to the press
1280125 i love the way this man handles himself its great to see so much positive press coverage of the usa coming from around the world
1280126 because he didnt want to make the wounded soldiers into a photo op
1280127 why would he feel its inappropriate to visit potential voters
1280128 i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen
1280129 unlike mccain who touts his pow story every chance he gets
1280130 also how does advocating ending the war equate to prolonging it
1280131 obama will not visit the troops in germany because he does not care
1280132 if you were truly a democrat after 8 years of the current bush brand of republicanism you would vote for a democratic candidate whoever it was
1280133 as the primary season has taught us there is a grand canyon between the democrat and republican agendas and visions
1280134 heaven forbid that a politician was actually somewhat reticent to use troops as political props
1280135 barack obama is wrong it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280136 barack obama is wrong it is never inappropriate to visit our men and women in the military
1280137 americans do not trust this guy and it is more evident every day why this is true
1280138 like all liberals he despises the military and cannot even force himself to keep the hatred in check
1280139 i am told that when one of obamas campaign staff was told he or she would be denied access the visit was canceled
1280140 it would have been like the troops were being used
1280141 and if he went to see the troops would you all be like
1280142 how dare he campaign stop on military grounds when that is not supposed to happen
1280143 if we can get over this epidemic of fatal obuma infection we can win the war on phony politicians
1280144 how dare he campaign stop on military grounds when that is not supposed to happen
1280145 might have been a good idea for him to see our wounded troops

1280184 we intend to pursue the claims in a mature but determined fashion in line with our existing procedural agreements with these employments
1280185 with inflation running at over 5 per cent a year and unlikely to abate to any significant extent in 2009 the employers have had almost six months to frame their position on pay
1280186 their final offer after just a few hours of negotiation was substantially short of what was necessary to match inflation and as such would amount to a significant pay cut in real terms for all workers

1280209 stiu cat de mult a avut de suferit industria auto in ultimul deceniu dar mai stiu si unde vreau ca masinile viitorului cele hibride sa fie construite nu in japonia nu in china ci aici in statele unite
1280210 inlocuirea unui milion de masini de pe drumuri din cele 200 de milioane existente acum cu masini hibride e un obiectiv greu de atins nu incape indoiala ca masinile hibride au un imens potential dar acest plan este exagerat

1280251 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
1280252 many are having problems paying salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved

1280258 we had a huge number of people who were in a position to see the atrocities that were going on in bosnia
1280259 theres going to be a lot of focus on srebrenica but there were a lot of other things that karadzic should be held accountable for the canadians were directly witnessing the ethnic cleansing going on more generally
1280260 the canadian involvement in the analysis of the remains is huge
1280261 my role largely throughout much of that time was monitoring the mass grave exhumations some related to srebrenica of course and other mass graves
1280262 at this time we have excavated and examined 23 secondary mass graves related to one execution event
1280263 we are aware that there are several more graves that need to be exhumed
1280264 after it collided with the trees there was a fire a small fire that erupted into a larger one
1280265 the plane is believed to have gone down due to a stall
1280266 we cant confirm that at this time or confirm what caused the stall
1280267 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working directly with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling

1280270 alexander solzhenitsyn was undoubtedly one of the great authors of our time and a central figure in the story of russias tragic 20th century like no one else he could capture in his books the reality of the stalinist hell that was the soviet union in the books one day in the life of ivan denisovich the first circle and the gulag archipelago he created some of the truly great works of contemporary history and literature on a day like this we have reason to remember him and the great work he did for his russia
1280271 after the collapse of the wto talks yesterday the parties to the talks must take their responsibility and think about how the doha round can be moved forward both us chief negotiator susan schwab and wto director general pascal lamy have said that despite everything the doha round is still alive the hope is to be able to resume negotiations in the near future

1280273 late this evening the office of the serbian president in belgrade announced that radovan karadzic has been arrested needless to say this is extremely welcome news i myself experienced how frustrating it was that he could not be brought to trial immediately after the end of the war in bosnia

1280278 ik ben vrij zeker dat ik even goed kan doen als vorig seizoen
1280279 van het niveau van vorig seizoen ben ik wel nog een eind verwijderd dat kan niet anders
1280280 maar ik hoop er bij de competitiestart te staan wat ik wel vrees is een terugval op een bepaald moment dat schijnt er bij te horen
1280281 maar ik twijfel niet aan mezelf ik ben vrij zeker dat ik geen eendagsvlieger ben
1280282 natuurlijk moet ik vertrekken als er een mooie club komt als ik mijn sportieve en financi le toekomst kan veiligstellen mag ik niet weigeren

1280284 making somerset safer is a top priority for somerset county council and one of the ways we achieve that is through the excellent work of our trading standards service
1280285 this latest seizure highlights that the trade in counterfeits is a global problem and i am pleased that our own officers are playing an important role in combating it
1280286 anyone caught dealing in counterfeits in somerset can expect to end up in court and also faces the prospect of having their assets confiscated as the proceeds of crime
1280287 homelessness affects tens of thousands of children in the uk alone i was one of those children once and i feel blessed to be here now having turned things around
1280288 i swore that my child wouldnt have to suffer like i did my little girl has a roof over her head and all the things that make up a stable home life every child at the very least should have this i hope my visit will highlight the vital work shelter is doing to help so many children and their families
1280289 shelter is delighted that danelle harvey is taking time out of her schedule to make this fun day even more special for the children who have been helped by our service
1280290 shelters educational support project plays a crucial role in rebuilding the lives of those children whose education has been affected by their housing situation we hope danelle can use her popularity to raise awareness of the thousands of children whose lives are blighted by homelessness and bad housing
1280291 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding
1280292 a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood
1280293 this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1280294 we are extremely pleased to have been involved in this project
1280295 this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk
1280296 through the website we want people to respond to consultations write to their local mp find out their flood risk and make their voice heard
1280297 we are delighted to have worked with playgen on this project keeping this issue in the public eye is vital
1280298 around 45 000 norwich union customers were affected by the floods in 2007 our job is two fold to put things right for our customers as quickly as possible and secondly work in partnership with the government agencies and the general public to ensure the uk is better prepared for the effects of flooding in future
1280299 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1280300 it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1280301 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so
1280302 but it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places
1280303 in relation to the housing market there is no doubt that a combination of peoples general mood and outlook and the fact that mortgage finance has been constrained is pushing prices down
1280304 i dont need to because the bank of england has an obligation to target inflation but also to act in support of the governments general policies
1280305 so its remit is perfectly adequate to allow it to take everything it needs to into account
1280306 at a time when things are difficult where inflation is a problem that is looming one that i think can be dealt with i dont think this is the time to start changing the remit for the bank of england
1280307 i have said before i believe we can get through this i believe we can win the next election provided we discover the same zeal and enthusiasm that we had in 1997 2001 and 2005
1280308 i think the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1280309 the prime minister when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do
1280310 i am very clear in my mind provided we can get across to people what we are for the difference government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn the situation around
1280311 i have exactly no doubt about that david was making exactly the same point
1280312 i believe fundamentally what we stand for a fairer society where everybody gets the best opportunity for themselves and their families that is something that only a labour government will deliver
1280313 that is what we will deliver with gordon brown we will get through these difficulties we can turn the situation round and we will turn the situation round
1280314 my main focus at the moment is working with energy companies to see how we can help people meet the higher bills they are facing at the moment
1280315 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1280316 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1280317 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1280318 are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter
1280319 her lawyer advised her not to answer she had been made arguido and that gives you the right not to answer
1280320 her lawyers told her not to answer because there was a fear the questions could be leading

1280322 at the moment we are seeking advice from zoos particularly how the public should respond to any sightings
1280323 we have been advised that six foot is not large for a boa constrictor however people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite
1280324 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers
1280325 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100 million a year taken from motorists
1280326 how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1280327 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1280328 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1280329 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1280330 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1280331 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1280332 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding
1280333 recent government figures have shown that the number of people exceeding 30mph speed limits has fallen so the message is getting through
1280334 more people are getting tickets because speed limits are being enforced more vigorously more people are now beginning to view speeding in the same light as drinking and driving in that it is an anti social thing to do but there is still a long way to go
1280335 the longer it goes on they actually draw strength from that
1280336 it would appear they were seeking to apply pressure by overstating the evidence that they had and frankly it is a scandal
1280337 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1280338 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1280339 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab
1280340 it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1280341 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1280342 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1280343 theres a number of other witnesses that place gerry very clearly at the tapas bar
1280344 we shall ensure prompt payment of taxes customs clearance and that goods purchased under the grant are not re exported from uganda
1280345 electricity is critical for poverty reduction and economic growth because power serves as a foundation for all kinds of socio economic activities
1280346 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1280347 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1280348 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1280349 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1280350 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1280351 refuges campaign is a warning siren to all women no matter what their age or background
1280352 everyone has the right to live free from control and violence dont ignore the warning signs of domestic violence
1280353 the soap stack is generally regarded as an embarrassing failure these days
1280354 rest does what the soap stack was trying to do in a much more viable elegant cheap affordable way except that weve got no tooling around it yet
1280355 tim bray is a rest proponent and hell say what he needs to to bash soap and promote rest soap is alive and well theres no widespread movement away from soap if you can find evidence of that apart from tim bray let me know
1280356 its ironic as well that hes incorrect about the lack of rest tooling jackbe corizon and others support rest
1280357 up until two years ago if you were a serious programmer you wrote code in either java or net

1280360 the java language isnt going away its the worlds most popular programming language

1280372 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the las vegas chefs field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of las vegas chefs related experience
1280373 but im proud i was able to be part of such a distinguished research team
1280374 this great work will mean high profits for our firm

1280403 i respect the decision of supreme court its their function i understand that there will be a hearing on august 15 to look into the merits of the petition blocking the moa signing he added
1280404 the final agreement will have to be operationalized and legislated for example how can lanao del norte be dismembered and the boundaries of armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao be expanded without legislative act

1280430 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
1280431 the main achievement is that russia has revived its influence in the world
1280432 but morally we are too far from what is needed this cannot be achieved by the state through parliamentarianism as far as the state the public mind and the economy are concerned and russia is still far away from the country of which i dreamed

1280440 she told the president that dr suruma had refused to accept the new proposal to increase mps mileage allowances
1280441 as a commission we have come to an agreeable position to push for an across the board increment of shs300 for every litre paid for each mp but we dont know why its still a problem to the ministry of finance
1280442 i suggested that we have another urgent meeting with the parliamentary commission and finance to see what is impossible and possible
1280443 i am sure after this meeting we shall come up with a workable solution to the standoff over your mileage alliances we are going to solve this issue and i suggest we have this meeting as soon as possible
1280444 we had agreed in that meeting but when prof kiwanuka reported back to dr suruma he instead wrote to the president insisting that we mps were asking too much
1280445 we cannot operate normally and that is why we want this shs300 increment on our fuel allowances
1280446 we dont have enough funds and we are financially conscripted because of other pressing priorities
1280447 i dont think it will be possible to get this money as members want because we dont have it now
1280448 we have launched the fourth term bid for president museveni here at bungokho a home for all the bamasaba today
1280449 mr president accept our urge to stand for a fourth term and we are determined to give you all the support do the mobilisation to ensure that you win the elections in 2011
1280450 you people of bugisu know what to do when it comes to elections dont go to a doctor who does not know how to treat or treats people and they die or even the doctor who is just trying to learn how to treat like fdc continue supporting the nrm and its leadership for good treatment
1280451 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1280452 they told her that the best thing she could do for al qaeda was to start popping out little jihadists
1280453 she was furious she knows more about this stuff than pretty much anyone in the organization
1280454 our officer returned fire she was shot in the stomach but continued to struggle
1280455 we thought she was dead until her brother in houston got a visit from the fbi the other day and said she is alive
1280456 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1280457 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1280458 we as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions let me be clear this is not protest this is terrorism
1280459 prior to that the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions break into the lab steal the animals trash the facility
1280460 more recently however theyve become much more personal attacking the researchers at their homes california seems to be the focus of this activity right now but not the only focus
1280461 i think its a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people
1280462 these are incidents that could have killed someone they are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge they are a serious attack on academic freedom
1280463 preach this we respect all living things and then they do that with children in the house
1280464 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories
1280465 putting himself and his family in harms way by continuing to abuse animals
1280466 for rational people this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society
1280467 we support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor
1280468 i gotta say that as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit particularly because weve been losing lately
1280469 but it is a very attractive shirt i must say
1280470 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1280471 given the perception out there i hope that figure would be a surprise to people
1280472 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people
1280473 what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1280474 when she speaks about unifying the party i totally believe she means it and i know she is doing everything she can do to make sure that happens

1280478 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1280479 everybody i think was taken aback because we had won iowa and there was this giddy sense that this thing is rolling this thing is moving and then we lost
1280480 i recite all this history because we do have three more months of work in this campaign and i think that theres a tendency particularly for democrats to start feeling kind of giddy again after a primary in the summer months

1280484 many mothers give up breastfeeding when they resume work due to stress and lack of time when mothers have more leave days they can breastfeed their children longer
1280485 health workers need to emphasise breastfeeding since they have access to mothers immediately after childbirth and during antenatal care
1280486 if you want treatment you go to a knowledgeable doctor you dont go to someone whose patients have all died or a doctor still learning like fdc
1280487 how can you go to a learner for treatment nrm has cured many diseases of uganda

1280493 for eight months a year were a family and at times things happen tempers flare up but its within the family and its a little bit rude when your neighbors are fighting next door for you to go over and ask what happened thats kind of the case here its nobodys business what happened
1280494 nothing needs to be talked about in the minor leagues theres no cameras on it but stuff like that happens all the time
1280495 i dont see too many good things that can come of it but were all grown men

1280505 ha let s finish this one first please y know we didn t buy this series so that we could make fallout 3 and put it away and never do it again
1280506 we own fallout the series is wholly ours we ve just licensed back the rights to an mmo to interplay under certain conditions but it s still ours just like the elder scrolls is ours

1280509 it also looks at the caucus outreach and building support networking and enhancing legislative capabilities of the caucus members this plan will not only act as a guiding framework for the nrm caucus but serve as a tool to mobilise resources
1280510 some people may not afford such fees i think it is better if we reviewed it so that they are able to access the inputs
1280511 she copied me her resignation letter it is a letter of two sentences in which she does not state the reason for her resignation but of course it is not resignation from fdc but from her portfolio in the party
1280512 you will know the reasons after i have discussed the matter with the party president dr kizza besigye
1280513 when we were forming fdc we agreed that the top positions would be distributed according to regions to create balance
1280514 fdc is a democratic party the fdc constitution is very clear that electing people into executive positions is a preserve of the partys national delegates conference
1280515 if the national council had held those elections it would have been illegal
1280516 it is not yet time to draw conclusions that the buganda region is marginalised in fdc
1280517 the position of party chairperson is wanted by both baganda and the muslims because the late kiggundu represented both groups those interested should wait for the delegates conference to sell their interests to the party delegates

1280519 there is a lot of good work going on and aid continues to get through to cyclone hit areas especially from local organisations who are managing to help hundreds of thousands of people in extremely challenging circumstances
1280520 but it is now three months since the cyclone hit and it is widely accepted that many people have yet to receive any significant support the responsibility for this lies with the regime and the hurdles that it continues to place in front of aid agencies the regime must get fully behind the humanitarian aid effort and remove all barriers for agencies working on the ground

1280528 a television interviewer once asked me but what about nuclear waste will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years i knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world one of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife this is true of the land around chernobyl the bomb test sites of the pacific and areas near the united states savannah river nuclear weapons plant of the second world war wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets i find it sad but all too human that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste carbon dioxide

1280533 well once upon a time there were some men with big sticks
1280534 norway generates almost all its electricity from hydro and ive never heard of them having an unreliable electricity supply
1280535 it may be more capital intensive though i dont know where you get the idea that it is expensive to maintain do you have some evidence for that neither do i understand why using renewable natural resources like rainfall is asking anyone to sacrifice anything whatsoever
1280536 5 peak uranium there are about 60 years worth of uranium left if all the worlds electricity were generated by nuclear we would run out of usable uranium in about 3 years yes there are other fuel technologies and reactor designs that have been worked on but last time i checked none of them were actually viable and most of them had been abandoned as such
1280537 to the best of my current knowledge on the subject the fast breeder reactors as opposed to just breeder reactors that would make this possible still do not exist as anything other than prototypes and the ability to do it on a commercial scale has not been proven yet
1280538 your link is from 1996 so i think i can get away with posting this one from 2001 im sure stuff has changed a bit since then but the article seems to be in line with things as far as ive been able to find out though maybe im wrong anyway brief synopsis fast breeders are still very much an unproven technology
1280539 finally im really not sure its a good idea to allow profit turning corporations to control things which could potentially explode and kill millions of people
1280540 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1280541 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is the young people of russia today understand less and less
1280542 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1280543 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1280544 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and
1280545 hopefully by end of august we will start the pilot project
1280546 we really dont know how the system works we need to get used to it we have to sort out glitches if there are any in the beginning
1280547 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1280548 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1280549 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out there like everybody else
1280550 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1280551 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1280552 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now

1280562 need is missing then my stupid ass thinks that she is been back from vacation for days and she has not bothered to call me that is the real kick in the jewels that she does not want to talk to me and i need to know why
1280563 i truly do wish i were a less selfish person ive been told im not selfish but there are still points in my life where i am
1280564 i have been slowly examining the all decisions about myself deciding if they were mine or given to me and if they are still valid
1280565 i will make a robot to do this job for you

1280585 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1280586 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1280587 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1280588 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1280589 im not much of an athlete i eat a lot of mcdonalds
1280590 i finally pulled my head out of my rear it took a while to adjust to the from canada its practically still winter there people are still ice skating
1280591 when i saw him win his bronze medal on television i really wanted to work hard to feel the same emotions myself
1280592 it was not easy finding my way until 2000 i felt he was better than me to beat him was like a sacrilege
1280593 now of course i share every one of my medals with him
1280594 i dont want to live these games with my eyes shut just to make sure my 90 seconds race will be a success
1280595 thirty seconds before the start i want to take a chance to look at the stands and the scenery to keep memories and tell my family about them later
1280596 its disappointing that they are not going to be there
1280597 i was looking forward to playing them but i am sure they will be back at the next games
1280598 we are feeling good the lead up has been really good
1280599 its very sad that they hockey team are not here
1280600 this is a tragedy for the athlete this kind of suspicion not just in cycling but any sport its bad and it can distract from a desired result
1280601 we believe him we have faith but who knows maybe in the technical data something will show up
1280602 he spent a lot of time at altitude and his body was attuned to elevation where there is less oxygen that alone has the effect of changing blood indicators but all we can do now is wait and follow procedures
1280603 one doping instance and everything we earn in the olympics could be wiped out i ask you to take maximal control and get maximum guarantees that international cycling officials have no pretences in the gusev affair against our athlete
1280604 to have him fit again has a calming influence on the team because hes a key player for us
1280605 we already have the gold medal right now and that gives us extra motivation to defend it
1280606 were playing well and have had some strong practices so were going to be ready were getting better and better every day were in a very positive mood
1280607 there is no extra pressure on us because were the champions
1280608 we know we have to play well the u s and spain are the best two teams in the world and if we want to win gold we know we have to go through them
1280609 the last two major international tournaments the u s finished third we play a bit more european like spain with the tough defence and fast break than the nba style the u s play but i think we can beat both of them
1280610 i dont think ive enjoyed sculling as much as i have this year
1280611 we were very pleased with what we did in europe but i really treat those european results with caution
1280612 i just know there are two or three crews that youre just not going to see until the last part of the olympic final its how it is they perform poorly in the early regattas and then they always come up for the big one
1280613 touch wood ive done everything i can and im confident that ive managed the problem i didnt actually know if id have a second life and row so im feeling somewhat privileged to be back
1280614 we think were getting close to what we want now
1280615 however i would not have wanted to have those four gold medals right now and have the eyes of the world thinking trinidad and tobago is a place where its ok to cut corners the reputation of my country was a lot more important to me than any medal and cheating
1280616 what bothers me most about it is the resignation and the attitude of a lot of the public that its just part of sport today
1280617 we need to get over that because its not ok its more than just cheating its the future of sport not just the livelihood and dreams of the athletes
1280618 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee it
1280619 clearly we know now it wasnt the suit that was causing all these world records to be broken in 1976 it was copious amounts of steroids
1280620 can the suit technology distract from another issue i think its pretty convenient for those indulging in another issue
1280621 back when i was making 1 200 a month as a professional swimmer and that was it i always argued that more money should come into the sport and always was an advocate of professionalizing the sport
1280622 doping in the sport could potentially make us yearn for those good old days where 1 200 a month was the plight of the swimmer and not the decision to have to take performance enhancing drugs to compete with some of the worlds best
1280623 he has a right to voice his opinion im glad he speaks out if he feels he needs to
1280624 were a sport that has to overachieve to get recognition
1280625 were moving into a lot of new and prosperous territory
1280626 some people dont like that hes outspoken even if he has the best interests of the sport in mind
1280627 i think a lot of people tune him out me personally im glad a guy like gary is out there i want a clean sport if he wasnt talking about doping i dont know how much wed hear about it
1280628 ive been on deck all year and i think the americans are clean
1280629 shes inducted into the international swimming hall of fame and the u s olympic hall of fame and marion jones goes to jail
1280630 the only difference was that marion jones admitted it but they were both on the same list
1280631 i need to prove that a 40 year old is doing this clean and doing it the right way and now if anyone questions me there is nothing else i can do
1280632 i have given myself out there i have done blood tests urine tests anything that they want to test i have agreed to do
1280633 unfortunately there have been athletes who have sat there in the past and looked everyone in the eyes and said i am not taking drugs now they are in jail or indicted or whatever and you are now guilty until proven innocent thats why i stepped up and asked to be tested i could sit here and say i am not doping but i have to prove it now and thats why i have done this
1280634 what other sports have shown is that the more money you put into a sport the more somebody might have to lose and the more someone might start swimming for money
1280635 i dont think we will ever have a clean sport the testers can only find what they are looking for and there will always be people in this world for whatever reason money fame will always find ways to cheat and be ahead of everyone else ive coached for over 30 years and we live with this all the time
1280636 it has grown by leaps and bounds with the momentum of phelps it should continue to grow like that as long as the sport can maintain its shine the worst thing imaginable would be to have something like marion jones happen in swimming
1280637 i dont cringe when gary talks about doping in the sport
1280638 i respect what gary is saying we would be naive to say there is no doping in the sport i dont look at what has happened since the balco era as an overhang either i look at it as a spotlight i look at it as a healthy thing
1280639 the discussion about it the revelations that have come out the fact that there is more testing in other sports outside of olympic sports its not just an olympics issue its a sports issue
1280640 our batting has been hugely disappointing there were quite a few silly shots played
1280641 the good teams the clinical teams will close out those games with eight wickets in hand we didnt do that
1280642 i just said to kev were going to get a bad ball and when we do were going to put it away
1280643 also we just picked off the ones and twos and i just hope the guys who were sitting in the hutch could realise how easy it was to do that
1280644 the kenyans did bowl well but they are not really the kind of bowling team that should have had us struggling to get 68 off 20 overs
1280645 ryan ten doeschate is in my opinion probably the best player in associate cricket outside of andre botha
1280646 alex has come on and is now a senior member of the squad
1280647 o you who believe approach not prayers with a mind befogged until you can understand all that you say for allah does blot out sins and forgive again and again

1280649 was a homosexual and that there had been contact of a sexual nature between the neighbour and his cat
1280650 shooting someone for being a homosexual and for supposedly having sexual intercourse with a cat he helped rescue and for making the animal homosexual too is possibly one of the silliest motives i have ever heard in my life
1280651 compared to a decade ago there are three million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1280652 however there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1280653 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced
1280654 there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law

1280657 aqibs not a bad kid hes just got a little wild child in him
1280658 hey he has enough pressure on him with expectations as a player and those quote unquote character issues he has responsibilities of course but its up to us to hold him accountable
1280659 weve had a pretty good system here as far as showing the young guys the ropes how to do things and what accountability means
1280660 legal amp general has delivered a strong set of results in market and economic conditions that have as we expected been challenging
1280661 we have continued to focus on exploiting the resilience of our business model to grow profitably
1280662 these results reflect the success of this approach and demonstrate our continued strengths strong finances multi channel distribution a diverse product range across complementary businesses a strong brand and operational flexibility
1280663 when you first began airing your opinions on immigration surely it provoked a reaction firstly that you were exaggerating but also second that you were not just an idiot but also racist

1280666 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
1280667 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
1280668 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
1280669 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends

1280674 we learned from his psychologist that he was a narcissistic ex drug addict sociopath who blamed others for his incompetence
1280675 i am not talking about the president of course but about ivins who clearly was the one who sent the anthrax through the mail even though we were sure at first it was al qaeda and then that steven hatfill guy
1280676 i am glad we finally caught up with the terrorist killer
1280677 although i liked it when we planned at first for al qaeda to be the pet scapegoat who anthraxed those people to death
1280678 we would like to explain to the american people just why he targeted senators lahey and daschle the only two democrats who could have stopped the passage of the patriot act but due to national security we cant discuss it further
1280679 karl rove and scooter libby were innocent ivins exposed plames identity
1280680 a search of ivins home revealed that he was not only responsible for the questionable firing of nine us district attorneys but deliberately led us into the iraq war with lies about faulty intelligence

1280691 i want to catch big fish so i got the largest ones i found to help me with my wish
1280692 its not about the size of pole or quantity of bait its about your patience and how long you sit and wait you see son fishings much like dating it can be done all wrong sometimes you just have to wait before the right one comes along unless you have a great big boat from which you can go trolling just drop your line into the brine and continue with your lolling thats the end of the lesson at least until much later come back and see me sometime when youre a better sit and waiter
1280693 so you think youve learned everything about worms and fish and bugs pull up a stool and have a try
1280694 you need to learn some more just remember theres a fine line between a fisherman and an idiot on the shore i told you once now this is twice come back and see me later and next time dont bring along your voice you little master baiter

1280721 die gespr che zur novellierung der trinkwasserverordnung laufen ob es einen grenzwert gibt und wo er liegt wird noch verhandelt

1280723 the situation called for him to use his breaking ball because otherwise the yankees sit back and wait to drive the fastball the other way
1280724 hes done a better job being able to execute those pitches for strikes and expand the zone as well
1280725 the thing today the not so good ones and this is amazing were when he was ahead in the count when it was time for him just to throw it for a strike he does it when he tried to make it a little bit better thats when he would hang one and those are the ones that got away from him the ones that he just concentrated on throwing for a strike he actually did
1280726 hes not waiting until 3 0 until he steps off the rubber
1280727 wir m ssen blocher dankbar sein f r seine leistungen aber ich muss einem 68 j hrigen mann doch nicht alles nachreden
1280728 die lena ist eine gute fechterin im schwimmen kann sie gr tenteils mithalten wenngleich sie auf die besten ein paar sekunden verliert und im schie stand ist sie zwar gut aber meistens nicht ganz vorne
1280729 wenn das klappt in peking kann lena ganz vorne dabei sein
1280730 sie hat erst sp t angefangen mit dem reiten und dann steckt ihr noch dieser schwere sturz in den knochen
1280731 so etwas bleibt h ngen das dauert bis man das wieder rauskriegt
1280732 cuando volv a a davenport temprano por la ma ana tuve de repente la idea de que como era imposible pintar un barco de forma que no lo avistara un submarino hab a que hacer precisamente lo contrario es decir pintarlo no para lograr su baja visibilidad sino de modo que rompiera su forma y confundiese al oficial del submarino enemigo
1280733 we are looking very closely at hospitals which have already experienced serious outbreaks of this condition and were looking at what theyve done and put in place to reduce their numbers
1280734 we have actually brought over a team from england called the safer cleaner hospitals team to tell us about what approaches are being used and are having good success in great britain
1280735 i have spoken to a number of referees and the threat of strike action is certainly a real one
1280736 they are looking for parity with other comparable leagues in europe like norway holland belgium and greece
1280737 in norway referees receive 1200 per game in scotland they get 575 the scottish referees do not want what they get in norway but what they do want is the spl to make them a reasonable offer
1280738 they train two or three nights a week they do workshops as well as going to clubs and giving up their time free of charge
1280739 they want the spl to be realistic but they have been offered an increase of 25 to the referees that is just not acceptable
1280740 they do believe they are worth more money because of the pressure they are under now but they want the authorities to understand they need to be protected from chairman and managers who question their honesty and integrity
1280741 we are at the stage where referees are pilloried far too often now its unfair when managers start saying openly that a referee has cheated then we need to sit down and think again
1280742 the referees are attempting to flex some muscle because they feel and have done for a number of seasons that they are not given the proper support and backing from the scottish football association and the people who run the spl
1280743 there is the real threat that they will not do the games this saturday and i think there are a lot of fans that do support referees on this
1280744 the spl will have to come to some sort of compromise because they cannot delay the start of the season
1280745 it is not true that i am about to leave anfield
1280746 soy componente del equipo de tiro al plato de mi pa s y me hace ilusi n disputar mis cuartos juegos ol mpicos
1280747 olympiacos is a challenge for me i know i will be here for two years
1280748 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
1280749 olympiacos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league
1280750 the team has some good players a well known coach and fanatical supporters which always inspires them
1280751 the brazil international is coming to greece on tuesday afternoon and he will sign a three year contract
1280752 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1280753 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1280754 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1280755 i think stephen is a bit disappointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll
1280756 stephen has looked very sharp in pre season and i am not disappointed especially with lewis price being injured
1280757 he does the same work as everyone else puts it in on the runs and hes got a lot of heart
1280758 this is a massive occasion the olympic games mean everything to me all the hard work is done and i cant wait to get in there
1280759 i think ive got a good chance if i perform to the best of my ability i think ive got ability to beat anyone in the draw
1280760 if i get my tactics right ill get a medal ideally it will be gold
1280761 there was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but im still here and im happy with that
1280762 it is not a problem for me to stay here and thats what people have to understand
1280763 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you
1280764 to me there is no point when i have all that at celtic im really happy in my football and in my life right now
1280765 i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good
1280766 i am pleased to have got everything sorted out and it means i dont need to worry about where i will be next year
1280767 i never wanted to leave the club it is my club and im very happy here i feel my game is developing and improving all the time in the environment at hull fc
1280768 a three year deal not only gives me security but the chance to concentrate on my rugby doing my best for the team instead of thinking about next year and what am i going to be doing
1280769 ravi has earned the right to play he didnt perform as well as he would have liked in sri lanka maybe it was a wake up call for him
1280770 i think it was a bit of a reality check regarding just how tough cricket can be but he has gone back to essex this summer and you cant argue with anything he has done
1280771 he is one of the leading first class run scorers this season so he demands to be picked
1280772 he also got a double hundred in a one day game with leicestershire not many people have done that not even the great graham gooch
1280773 when i saw ravi as a youngster at 18 he was the most talented youngster ive ever seen now he is learning how to develop that talent into scoring runs
1280774 we didnt get in a big conversation about it but it did made me think
1280775 are unknown but what it refers to is that saving money alone will not make you rich or prosperous
1280776 i am aware of why paul cooke was left out by justin for the game against hull and i support him in that
1280777 im also aware of why he was left out against catalans again which were for the same reasons and which i support we want to resolve this sooner rather than later for the benefit of the club
1280778 id welcome paul cooke all the lads would welcome him
1280779 hes got incredible skill he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1280780 the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well but for all that well try to play good exciting football our opponents are always going to be trying to stop us from doing that
1280781 sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like
1280782 thats just the way it is but this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football good quality and exciting football
1280783 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1280784 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012
1280785 we are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1280786 at athens the combined margin of five british golds being silver medals was only 0 545sec that shows how close it can be
1280787 i do not anticipate the boa changing the by law at all
1280788 what we need to do is look at the appeal mechanism
1280789 the rest of the world is looking at what we do and a number are considering having similar eligibility rules
1280790 ultimately the reason we have the by law is that it is asked for by the athletes we carry out a poll after every games and there has never been less than 90 supporting it
1280791 there is a huge challenge for sport to make sure we have competition between athletes and not between chemist laboratories
1280792 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1280793 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1280794 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south are willing to move in that direction
1280795 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1280796 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1280797 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world

1280802 we underscore that our buy stance is far from sanguine given past management mis steps multiple pressures in its operating segments and aig stocks heightened sensitivity to highly volatile credit markets
1280803 i have an urgent request we have a sales training next week and want to show the reps which products our retail customers have been purchasing from that company we just bought
1280804 ok im sure well have that somewhere copy to bi people in us europe but note that the raw numbers will need interpretation some products have low revenue but are big competitive differentiators and since our customers look nothing like theirs what was sold in the past and wh here
1280805 when i saw him win his bronze medal on television i really wanted to work hard to feel the same emotions myself
1280806 it was not easy finding my way until 2000 i felt he was better than me to beat him was like a sacrilege
1280807 now of course i share every one of my medals with him
1280808 i dont want to live these games with my eyes shut just to make sure my 90 seconds race will be a success
1280809 thirty seconds before the start i want to take a chance to look at the stands and the scenery to keep memories and tell my family about them later
1280810 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1280811 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1280812 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1280813 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1280814 no woman or a young person shall be required or allowed to work whether as an employee or otherwise in any establishment during nights
1280815 strassers men were responsible for among other things torture of political opponents
1280816 the government has a responsibility to investigate because torture committed anywhere is a crime under u k law
1280817 how can you say the claims amnesty international is making are justified
1280818 they know it is the revolutionary united front that has been responsible for those abuses and violations
1280819 they were tried they were prosecuted they were convicted they were sentenced
1280820 i was going to an off license and then this guy just turned around and came at me with a knife something like a swiss army penknife
1280821 i was stabbed and i had to be taken to hospital i couldnt put it down to anything other than racial motivation
1280822 it is time to take the family pet to the vet
1280823 when you hold resentment toward another you are bound to that person or condition by an emotional link that is stronger than steel forgiveness is the only way to dissolve that link and get free

1280906 there was an unmitigated trust in both science and the military option exemplified most completely in the atomic bomb on the other hand though this was also a period of significant church expansion and to be a good american meant that one was also a good protestant christian

1280918 too dark has become your life to covered in sin
1280919 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1280920 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1280921 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1280922 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1280923 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1280924 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1280925 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1280926 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1280927 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1280928 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1280929 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1280930 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1280931 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1280932 the role calls for exceptional strategic leadership and real skill in developing and sustaining positive working relationships with partner organisations
1280933 capital needs were neglected in favor of parks and non profit organizations
1280934 nafsu tidak ubahnya ular dia baru diam tatkala telah penuh kesedihan
1280935 iblis menjawab karena engkau telah menghukum saya karena tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalangi mereka dari jalan engkau yang lurus kemudian saya akan mendatangi mereka dari muka dan belakang dari kanan dan dari kiri dan engkau tidak mendapati kebanyakan mereka bersyukur
1280936 tidak ada kesanggupan bagi kami untuk melawan kekuatan jalut dan tentaranya
1280937 berapa banyak terjadi golongan yang sedikit dapat mengalahkan golongan yang banyak dengan izin allah
1280938 saya lebih baik dari adam engkau menciptakan aku dari api sedangkan adam engkau ciptakan dari tanah
1280939 tiga perkara yang membuatmu hancur adalah kikir mengikuti hawa nafsu dan sifat membanggakan diri
1280940 sifat sombong dan ujub mampu menghapus segala bentuk keutamaan dan bisa merendahkan diri
1280941 bukanlah orang yang kuat itu adalah seorang pegulat namun yang disebut orang kuat adalah mereka yang bisa mengendalikan amarahnya
1280942 jadilah pemaaf dan suruhlah orang mengerjakan yang maruf serta jangan pedulikan orang orang yang bodoh
1280943 tidaklah kelemahlembutan itu berada pada sesuatu kecuali akan membuatnya indah dan tidaklah kelembutan itu dicabut kecuali akan menjadikannya jelek
1280944 dan mereka menyungkur atas muka mereka sambil menangis dan mereka bertambah khusyuk
1280945 ada dua kenikmatan yang membuat kebanyakan manusia terpedaya terhalang dari mendapat kebaikan dan pahala yaitu kesehatan dan waktu luang
1280946 sesungguhnya jika kamu bersyukur pasti kami akan menambah nikmat kepadamu dan jika kamu mengingkari nikmat ku maka sesungguhnya azab ku sangat pedih
1280947 ya tuhanku tunjukilah aku untuk mensyukuri nikmat mu yang engkau berikan kepadaku dan kepada ibu bapakku dan supaya aku dapat berbuat amal saleh yang engkau ridhai berilah kebaikan kepadaku dengan memberi kebaikan kepada anak cucuku sesungguhnya aku bertaubat kepada mu dan sesungguhnya aku termasuk orang orang yang berserah diri
1280948 jika berbicara selalu berdusta jika berjanji selalu ingkar dan jika dipercaya selalu berkhianat
1280949 ada empat dosa sifat yang jika seseorang memperlihatkan semua cirinya dia sepenuhnya orang munafik jika dia punya salah satu ciri dia dianggap memiliki unsur unsur seorang munafik ciri ciri itu adalah berkhianat berdusta ingkar janji dan memaki lawan jika ada perbedaan pendapat
1280950 sesungguhnya orang orang munafik itu ditempatkan pada tingkatan yang paling bawah dari neraka dan kamu sekali kali tidak akan mendapat seorang penolong bagi mereka
1280951 setiap aku membandingkan ucapanku dengan perbuatanku aku takut jika aku digolongkan sebagai seorang munafik karena ada ucapanku yang berbeda dengan perbuatanku
1280952 aku bertemu dan berteman dengan 30 sahabat besar nabi saw yang selalu merasa ketakutan bila digolongkan sebagai munafik tidak ada seorang pun di antara mereka yang menyombongkan keimanan dan kesalehannya ataupun membual

1280959 its not just about workforce diversity but diversity of customers or in some cases clients
1280960 i want people to walk away from this feeling good not just seeing something different or eating some good food

1280964 diabetes prevention is more than just making sure you dont get diabetes
1280965 its looking at whether you have a safe place to take walks and whether you have fresh food readily available to you
1280966 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1280967 that shows progress and the three parties have a lot of work to do
1280968 the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda the omen is very good
1280969 this is an opportunity for governors to receive views on this important issue it is not a vote
1280970 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1280971 if you dont quit something bad will happen to you
1280972 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1280973 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1280974 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1280975 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1280976 the governor has been pushing republicans and democrats to come to a compromise
1280977 it is very difficult for the economy to recover with the heavy hand of the government treasury in its pocket
1280978 this is mr salesman the guy who could sell anything
1280979 if hes going to sell his party on a sales tax and the democrats who view it as regressive he ought to lay it out before the people

1280993 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years

1280999 when we started the first 100 fans promotion we were stunned when someone arrived 18 hours in advance and asked where he could wait in line
1281000 almost five years later weve given away more than 7 million in free chick fil a food across the country to raving fans whove braved snow wind rain and triple digit temperatures to help us celebrate the opening of each new chick fil a
1281001 since its first chain restaurant opened more than 40 years ago chick fil a has become synonymous with freshly prepared food and my pleasure customer service
1281002 my team and i are eager to continue that legacy at our new jacksonville location
1281003 nach fast drei jahren mit solidem wachstum und mehr als 1 5 millionen zus tzlichen arbeitspl tzen k hlt sich das wirtschaftswachstum derzeit ab
1281004 f r die zweite jahresh lfte und den jahreseinstieg 2009 rechnen wir mit deutlich schw cheren zahlen aber nicht mit einem abschwung
1281005 viele unternehmen stellen derzeit personal ein und suchen teilweise h nderingend fachkr fte 500 000 zus tzliche arbeitspl tze wird es nach unserer prognose in diesem jahr geben

1281007 using new antiretroviral drugs correctly today including hiv integrase inhibitors is critically important since the pipeline for additional new agents is not likely to provide treatment options beyond our current choices for a number of years
1281008 tools like hiv resistance phenotype tests including monograms phenosense integrase and phenosense gt assays and the hiv tropism assay trofile tm are important tools to help clinicians make good choices they can also help with modifying regimens that are not suppressive by determining whether additional resistance has emerged and which drugs are no longer active
1281009 as the first and only commercially available assay to measure integrase inhibitor resistance phenosense integrase exemplifies monograms leadership position in personalized medicine and the companys continued commitment to develop innovative hiv diagnostics that tailor drug treatments to the individual patient
1281010 as evidenced by todays product launch and last years introduction of trofile monogram is firmly committed to ensuring that cutting edge diagnostics are readily available to meet the needs of patients and physicians
1281011 these top line results with boceprevir are very exciting especially given that genotype 1 is the most common and hardest to treat form of hepatitis c
1281012 boceprevir was well tolerated by patients in this study including those who received 48 weeks of boceprevir in the longer duration treatment arms
1281013 these top line results further validate this novel treatment paradigm and the design of our pivotal phase iii studies of boceprevir one in treatment naive patients and one in patients who had failed prior treatment in which all patients will receive 4 weeks of pegintron and rebetol prior to the addition of boceprevir
1281014 additionally this strategy has the potential to reduce the likelihood of the development of resistance by identifying patients who are responders to interferon and ribavirin prior to their receiving a protease inhibitor

1281021 we are very pleased that the fda recognizes the therapeutic value and the need of some patients to start therapy with a single pill combination
1281022 these approvals demonstrate our confidence in combination medications for this therapeutic category while reinforcing the novartis commitment to provide physicians with well researched and effective treatments for high blood pressure
1281023 saya melihat tidak akan ada perubahan yang signifikan bagi daerah karena selama ini pemerintah mau pun parpol parpol masih sangat sentralistik

1281038 because my workload is unpredictable i go through periods which are very intense
1281039 in my case with a small child and part time childcare that might mean a couple of weeks of very late nights and early mornings working over the weekend to get things done as a result i reach a point where i need a break but i fret about it a lot
1281040 sods law means you always get your best opportunities a week before youre due to go on holiday or take a break so you have to work like mad before you go
1281041 so ive taken breaks when ive wanted and not thought about potentially missing work opportunities
1281042 we all need to switch off otherwise things get stale
1281043 if they know they might have stuff coming up theyll try to get things sorted before my holiday
1281044 as with everything else it is about building up a relationship to a point where you can hopefully work together to make sure taking a break doesnt become an issue
1281045 im taking a break so ill turn down new work offered i will obviously suggest ill do whatever work theyre offering once i return if that isnt possible ill try and offer a solution like pointing them in the direction of someone else i think might be able to help them
1281046 by the time i leave for my holiday im always utterly exhausted then i worry that when i come home ill have to live on beans on toast for a while because my income will have dried up i often wonder if its worth all the hassle but luckily it always is
1281047 god dad stop telling them about how big the company says your dick got youre so embarassing you impotent bastard i hate you

1281286 graphically in itself its a very very powerful machine i think the problem is you have to teach programmers how to do that we have very very amazing programmers on our xbox team who when they get the ps3 in front of them it takes them forever because of the multi threading they do with the cell processor
1281287 its just how complex the cell processor is as people get their heads around that it gets better and you get more parity coming out but code has to be written in a certain way for that and its a lot more complicated than it is for the xbox
1281288 i think youre seeing development teams now ramp up you get people who are dedicated to the ps3 and thats why youre getting equal graphics you see some stuff on the ps3 like metal gear solid that push it very very firmly graphically and im sure resistance 2 is going to do that as well i think youre going to see games that are developed for each console specifically the exclusives really push it that way still i think the xbox even though it doesnt have as much hard drive space is not blu ray you still see that its a very very powerful machine
1281289 magicians dont really know why their tricks work they just work
1281290 the main thing is to have a gutsy approach but use your head
1281291 next time you go to an airport kiosk for self service check in just type in your ticket reference number
1281292 unless the kiosks are equipped with the latest in tamper proof technology and card readers that encrypt data when the card is swiped they are highly prone given their public locations to criminal tampering they are a perfect target for thieves
1281293 not an aviation security issue its more of a customer service issue
1281294 what happens is completely up to the way the software is designed
1281295 somebody has to physically take that information take that data and delete it
1281296 most people when they go to a kiosk just think of it as a way to identify you not as a system that captures your credit card information
1281297 we strive to make things convenient and we strive for a reduction of operational costs but we focus on convenience more than security and now were getting bit by that
1281298 oh honey im sorry it didnt go through let me key in the number
1281299 the machines generally display a message such as your credit card will not be charged suggesting that the account number wont even be read by the machine
1281300 magicians dont really know why their tricks work they just work
1281301 in a field that has been marked by great human achievement during the past several decades our branch of it can only be called a failure
1281302 many real attacks on information systems exploit psychology more than technology
1281303 security design is by nature psychological yet many systems ignore this
1281304 now were not worried about pedophiles were worried about people who havent been police checked
1281305 in response to an insecurity weve created more sources of insecurity
1281306 when will we know weve won the war on terror

1281308 then with heavy hearts they walk through rows of cubicles at american companies and see post it notes tacked onto computer screens with passwords

1281310 well when you are supposed to remember 50 passwords to do your job they are forced to change on different schedules they all have different length requirements special character requirements different not allowed characters this is what you get post it notes

1281324 when t mobile customer service told me i could always take the battery out of my phone to avoid the charges i couldnt believe this was happening to me
1281325 it left me no choice but to try to stand up for myself and others in the same situation
1281326 t mobile is committed to providing the best customer experience in wireless and does offer customers the ability to block chargeable text messages
1281327 t mobile also has extensive filters built into the network to help detect and block spam text messages being sent to customers handsets that originate from internet ip addresses
1281328 the text messaging feature on your account is actually a mandatory feature and cannot be removed
1281329 this feature is needed because its where voice mail and billing notifications are delivered
1281330 this is a matter of a long line of abuses where people with the carrier have very little choice
1281331 zaldivar was damned if he did and damned if he didnt he felt trapped and that he was put in an unfair position
1281332 when in the course of modern human events it becomes necessary
1281333 i recently had a wamu credit card raise my interest rate by 60 and my minimum payment by 30 without explanation
1281334 prohibit creditors from setting a cut off time for mailed payments that is earlier than 5 p m at the location specified by the creditor for receipt of such payments
1281335 effectively price controls which have never worked in the past and we do not believe they will work here
1281336 these rules will result in less competition higher consumer prices fewer consumer choices and reduced consumer access to credit cards
1281337 adequate time for system changes staff training testing and integration
1281338 we continue to believe no additional prior notice should be required where the penalty interest rate has already been disclosed to consumers and is part of their account terms
1281339 we wish to point out that a true opt out of the payment of overdrafts related to atm and point of sale debit card transactions is not feasible
1281340 i support your plan to ban overdraft fees on debit holds please go one step further and ban overdraft fees when the funds are in my account but havent cleared yet
1281341 when you give a dance you have to pay the band
1281342 then they bury you in over the limit charges late charges and overdraft fees the banks make billions on these transactions alone i say some oversight is necessary to protect the consumer
1281343 of the people by the people and for the people
1281344 hey be a pity to see anything happen to that pretty credit rating just pay the fee and well see that nothing happens to it
1281345 screw you americans big government only cares about big business
1281346 limiting the interest rates and fees that banks can charge troubled customers will end up forcing the institutions to charge higher rates to good customers the association argues
1281347 these rules will result in less competition higher consumer prices fewer consumer choices and reduced consumer access to credit cards
1281348 why is my bill due 10 days earlier this time
1281349 because we noticed that you pay your bill well before the due date so as a courtesy we adjusted your due date
1281350 well we noticed that you pay you bill ahead of time so the due date was moved up
1281351 well they tried at least they took the risk good for them
1281352 everybody who goes into a retail store today and walks away frustrated that they could not get their questions answered can get the help they need
1281353 we found that consumers are lining up to talk to the person on the screen because they know the dopey kid behind the counter cant answer their question
1281354 when consumers start using it it becomes their preferred mode of engagement
1281355 how many times have you walked out of the store because you knew more than the kid who was helping you
1281356 a lot of companies get enamored with the technology and lose sight of the consumer
1281357 many companies dont think like their customers they think in ways to make the companys life easier rather than how do we make the consumers life easier
1281358 i always feel like i could do much better actually talking to someone than just comparing typing skills
1281359 if you could take the top 50 associates you have and take them off the sales floor and make them available chain wide thats the ideal situation
1281360 in order to serv you better push 1 for push 2 for
1281361 if companies cant even bother to greet store shoppers with in person smiles why would consumers bother to go to the store
1281362 and of course the advice will only be as good as the operators who are hired to give it but its easy to imagine a firm hiring ill equipped 8 an hour operators to read off poorly written scripts instead
1281363 what aisle can i find this widget at oh aisle 7 well i still cant find it are you sure its in stock
1281364 they care more about the stock holders than anyone else
1281365 now how can i help you with that dryer installation sir
1281366 oh im sorry maam what was it you wanted again
1281367 i need someone who can help me with an incorrect charge on my account
1281368 forget about the customer and the customer soon forgets about you
1281369 i dont want to team up he she is some religion other than mine or is male female or in a different political party etccc
1281370 well help from retail clerks are useless i know more
1281371 lets ask for so much information that the customer will give up
1281372 my employer didnt spend the time to teach me this and that
1281373 says tom from merritt island at 7 18 9 06 07
1281374 i dont believe in administrative fees and i dont think any buyer should pay them
1281375 a sophisticated buyer may say im not going to pay that fee
1281376 you might get angry but are you going to lose a deal because of 250
1281377 the services of a real estate broker are those of a professional and they agree to be compensated for providing a bundle of services and that bundle is reflected in commissions
1281378 i think administrative fees are inappropriate but thats my opinion i come from the school of thought that if you are a professional you deal with consumers as a professional and you dont nickel and dime them
1281379 administrative fees tack on i have also seen courier fees too ahum yes the realitors are getting their gas for travel too and still recieving a big commission
1281380 it amazes me that the other side of the coin is never mentioned like the fact that we can take customers out spend our time gas etc for nothing if there is no deal
1281381 well since you did not include it in the hud statement than you title company must pay for it
1281382 well you need to call my buyer and tell him so it is disclosed in the buyers sales agreement
1281383 i think the real estate industry is a scam i do not understand why you should pay more for selling a more expensive house lets see does it take the real estate agent more work to sell a 200 000 house rather than a house for 100 000 why do we need them anyway
1281384 negotiate the lowest lawyer fee or doctor fee or any other fee associated with high level competant service
1281385 id walk away from the deal over a 200 fee
1281386 we received a 2500 credit at closing seller paid the same commission sellers agent made more money than if there was a buyer agent
1281387 cant come up w the money needed to pass the title on
1281388 how about eliminating the buyers agent commission completely and save thousands
1281389 in the current system the seller and the sellers agent pay the buyers agent not only is this illogical but the buyer loses all control over thousands of dollars in commissions
1281390 in the case of an unrepresented buyer the seller and the sellers agent typically keep the buyers agent commission
1281391 most of this commission if not all of it usually goes to the agent even though no additional service was provided in effect the agent is collecting a bonus while the buyer does all the work
1281392 1 the commission a sellers agent receives can not change because a buyer does not have an agent
1281393 2 the buyers agent compensation must be paid solely by the buyer
1281394 3 the buyer can add the buyers agent compensation to the mortgage
1281395 1 gives home buyers control over which real estate services they want if any
1281396 2 lowers the cost of homes for buyers by reducing real estate commissions this will help more people afford homes
1281397 3 increases competition in the real estate industry which will help lower commissions overall
1281398 4 prevents sellers real estate agents from collecting a double commission while providing no additional services the current system artificially inflates housing prices making homes harder to buy and sell
1281399 oh i love my client they get the best possible rate no closing cost loan
1281400 theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you
1281401 do you charge an admin fee and if so for what
1281402 it is ridiculous how the media is beating up on we realtors
1281403 if you can get more than that you can have it
1281404 junk fees currier email and so forth its the whole trick of i will send your eyes this way so you dont really see what i am doing do yourself a favor do not follow this advice
1281405 it really is a great time to buy a home
1281406 i worked in the mortgage industry for like 2 years
1281407 why in gods green earth does a realtor charge 5 6 to basically open and close a door and say oh what a beautiful view out this window mr and mrs smith i mean if you want the best for yuor client why charge them 5 6
1281408 i guess the only thing they love is the paycheck which surprises me as a bartender now in a nice establishment i over heard two realtors from prudential talk how they were able to sell this house and make 7 000 off it
1281409 and they went over what bs lines and sales tatics they had to use and how their mortgage guy wrote the loan and will most likely be in forcloseure in no time but hey they were able to get their vacation cruise off that guys commission bottom line real estate agents are fancy upgraded car salesman that will lie cheat and steal their way and mislead anyone to get their 1 3 commission stop blaming the mortgage industry for the hosuing crisis which i admit is partly at fault but blame the realtors who put people in homes through shady mtg guys that cant afford that home
1281410 franklyrealty should be visited by an attorney hired by the realtors do some investigation on your own before printing this kind of an article
1281411 i have a better solution for the commision structure a professional licensed and educated realtor charges 6 to 7 commision no matter what the sell price may it be 75 000 or 350 000 the realtor works the same amount time on all potental closings to get there paycheck i propose a flat fee of 3 000 per transaction and no administrative fee
1281412 i am not buying any extras or protection you can waste our time or not but the answer is no
1281413 just another misunderstanding come in well complete the deal as stated
1281414 lana robbins why are you bashing journalists when you should be bashing the creep real estate agents 90 of whom make the remaining 10 look bad perhaps you are one of the 90 like lawyers used car salesmen and journalists there are some good and ethical agents out there the subject article simply points out a way to tell them apart from the creeps sorrow
1281415 bob you have done a great job this week but i think we are only going to pay you for 30 hours you dont mind do you
1281416 how about eliminating the buyers agent commission completely and save thousands
1281417 in the current system the seller and the sellers agent pay the buyers agent not only is this illogical but the buyer loses all control over thousands of dollars in commissions
1281418 in the case of an unrepresented buyer the seller and the sellers agent typically keep the buyers agent commission
1281419 most of this commission if not all of it usually goes to the agent even though no additional service was provided in effect the agent is collecting a bonus while the buyer does all the work
1281420 1 the commission a sellers agent receives can not change because a buyer does not have an agent
1281421 2 the buyers agent compensation must be paid solely by the buyer
1281422 3 the buyer can add the buyers agent compensation to the mortgage

1281426 4 prevents sellers real estate agents from collecting a double commission while providing no additional services the current system artificially inflates housing prices making homes harder to buy and sell
1281427 why would you need an agent to represent you as the buyer
1281428 the lawyer that represents himself well you know the rest same premise in real estate
1281429 hey im saving x thousand with no agent so the home is
1281430 our route for today is to start at the widest part of the lake and swim to a nearby island before getting out and having a little hike then swimming back to the start
1281431 with swimhiking you are freed from the constraints of hiking on foot rivers and lakes become a barrier but if you swimhike you can go much further or at least in more directions
1281432 ive only made a few prototypes but it means im not tied to the spot where i would have left my clothes dogs would do their business on my clothes and kids would steal them though the worst was when a public spirited citizen saw my bundle of clothes and told the police i had committed suicide
1281433 you build up a sweat on land then cool off in the water but i also think its fun in the rain when youre walking and the raindrops hit your clothes its frustrating but if youre in the lake theres water all around anyway so it feels natural
1281434 is that you are mixing land and water so you feel a bit like james bond and tarzan
1281435 it makes people really happy theres something about bobbing around free from gravity in wide open spaces it doesnt cost a thing and it gives you the chance to see the country in a fresh new way
1281436 most people find that they can only stay in a pool for 20 minutes before getting bored but up to an hour or more if they are swimming outdoors if you then combine that with hiking youre getting a real cardiovascular workout
1281437 i have episode one of season three here were going to watch it right now
1281438 we underscore that our buy stance is far from sanguine given past management mis steps multiple pressures in its operating segments and aig stocks heightened sensitivity to highly volatile credit markets

1281492 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests
1281493 when we first started there werent any bands that sounded like us because we were a bit different
1281494 theres millions of bands that can get into the top 10 now and at the time it was impossible to get into the top 10
1281495 so we wanted to lead the way again and not follow
1281496 it sounds like the suns shining its the afternoon and youre getting ready to go out disco dancing
1281497 we recorded it in london it was sunny and we wrote stuff extremely quickly hopefully it sounds like how it was made and it was supposed to sound quick and off the cuff and happy and upbeat and wide
1281498 and weve travelled everywhere in the world as well you cant help but want to expand your sound
1281499 a lot more vocals more stacks of vocals and not just one direct voice
1281500 we wanted to be happy with what we were doing and not sound like theres a lot of radio 1 indie and it all sounds pretty similar
1281501 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests
1281502 and we wanted to make something weird and fresh and radical that people would go yes i remember what its like to live again
1281503 were not going to point fingers or name names but weve noticed that other bands didnt seem to be enjoying themselves on their new records
1281504 he brought a lot of vibe and spirit and happiness and joviality

1281517 we need to see what various people through the ulster scots community have to say regarding that implementation group and how the academy would work
1281518 i think there will be support for it given the considerable public sector support for the irish language over recent years i dont think there will be people who will now quibble if ulster scots is getting similar funding
1281519 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs

1281524 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces

1281538 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one in principle and one in practicality
1281539 the principle of providing certainty and stability certainly if you take our energy companies when i want them to be investing in new power stations is very important

1281680 advertisers are realising that if they create their own content they dont need to pay for ad space they have greater control over how their brand is portrayed and ideally they create a more in depth and involving interaction between consumer and brand

1281746 fifi is incredibly talented and has a broad audience appeal we knew she would ultimately appear across many mediums nationally
1281747 but her role with seven means she cant continue to do breakfast radio and we just cant see the shebang without her bright personality

1281764 property is a cyclical business and contraction will be inevitable as firms look to be more streamlined
1281765 markets like eastern europe russia ukraine turkey are still growing so it would be ludicrous to downsize european businesses anywhere near that figure
1281766 when i step on the line in beijing ill be ready to go
1281767 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1281768 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1281769 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1281770 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen
1281771 i dont know her reasons for saying what she did but it doesnt matter i try to ignore anything negative that would take my attention away from diving
1281772 shes a phenomenal diver whos dominated the 3 metre springboard for many years and shes definitely popular with fans really it will be great to watch her compete in beijing
1281773 i never received an apology but i wasnt waiting for one either
1281774 there are pros and cons to putting all your eggs in one basket but ive been really happy just concentrating on springboard
1281775 last year was the most difficult year of my life
1281776 the hardest thing me and my family have ever been through last summer all of us just felt broken i had no motivation to do anything i couldnt even get out of bed in the morning it didnt seem plausible physically mentally emotionally that i would ever be able to devote myself to the training and preparation that is necessary for the olympics i thought maybe i should throw in the towel
1281777 strachan only did good in this world he was the last person that this should have happened to
1281778 even through the roller coaster of his treatment i always believed that he would beat cancer because he always beat everything
1281779 he lived with such intensity he wanted to make a difference theres no textbook on how to recover from losing a loved one but my whole family drew strength and inspiration from the courage strachan displayed
1281780 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1281781 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1281782 every games seems to have that one moment that just grabs the canadian publics imagination that moment when everyone is tuned in
1281783 it can even be the reaction of the athlete sometimes when i went over the bar my arms went up in the air for years people would come up to me stick their arms in the air and say i know you
1281784 no one knew our names we werent supposed to contend
1281785 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1281786 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1281787 he might be able to dh or even play sometime soon
1281788 you walk in the video room hes watching tapes you could stand there for a half hour and he wont know youre there
1281789 its really my pleasure to manage a guy like doc
1281790 if you watch baseball long enough youre going to see something happen thats never happened before
1281791 guys get used to you pitching the same way you mix things up but striking players out is definitely not something im trying to do
1281792 i think the key thing is to not try and get giddy with it you get two strikes and then you try and make three or four perfect pitches and fall behind kind of like what i did early on i think thats when it causes more trouble
1281793 i was pretty damn close to achieving what i wanted to achieve which was a medal
1281794 i think theres hunger and a bit of revenge in mind for beijing
1281795 im always motivated to race for canada because i dont get the opportunity to do it too much
1281796 i think its a lot different from when i was a kid
1281797 when i was a kid i had a dream but i think it has changed and a lot of that has become reality
1281798 im still very passionate about the sport some of the greatest days i have in the year are out riding with my friends in the mountains
1281799 people struggle to find things they really love to do
1281800 if you have an opportunity to make a living doing something you love its unique
1281801 theres no doubt its frustrating but you just train hard eat well and try to get your sleep
1281802 its nice to come back to a family as well because it definitely puts everything in life into perspective
1281803 i think when youre just living your life as an athlete its easy to become singularly focused and not see 10 years down the road 15 years down the road 20 years down the road
1281804 definitely when you have a family it changes things quite a bit
1281805 its like you changing from a newspaper to another newspaper
1281806 this is for me a living and a job and a business and at times you change employers nine years is a long time so this team means more to me in my life than most teams ive coached
1281807 we have been in residency camp for two years its almost like a club so of course i will miss that part no doubt about it
1281808 i think some people are thinking about it but the main focus right now is the olympics
1281809 ive been here pretty much since pellerud joined and i really enjoyed working with him and its a pleasure but the same with a lot of the players theyll be done after the olympics too for a lot of us its kind of our last go so it makes it even more important for us to do well
1281810 its one thing to play before the whole hype starts its easier to be level minded youre focused and were away from the venue too so that helps
1281811 i just cant wait for china in china that games going to be crazy

1281953 the word just shuts people down this is not an academic exercise theres no point in giving parents a letter than doesnt have an impact
1281954 i find this particular line from the government tiptoeing through the daffodils
1281955 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds

1281960 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened we take such allegations seriously i havent spoken to anyone to find out what was allegedly said
1281961 prostituting herself during the entire proceedings by being nothing more than an employee of mr lee kuan yew and his son and carrying out their orders
1281962 the voices coming from australia and new zealand have been positive in the last day or two
1281963 i am very pleased that simon the worlds no 1 umpire who is also an australian is very keen to come here
1281964 its fine to listen to the advice of security advisers and government officials however this information needs to be balanced by the fact that former australian player geoff lawson coaches and lives in the country and imran khan a man of high standing in the game among others has vouched for how sportsmen have never been targeted in pakistan
1281965 from what i see in newspapers it is a good sign
1281966 and i still say that when teams and players talk about security they have to look at the big picture not a small one it is about cricket in asia and cricket in pakistan
1281967 umar gul will be playing in the games to prove his fitness and shoaib akhtar will also be back
1281968 it was a green metal box with a few paint marks on it with quite a few wires coming out of it into my daughter it didnt look like a normal nhs one
1281969 but it was the only hope for her even when she got hooked up to the dialysis machine they said that every hour was a bonus
1281970 shes fine now a normal two year old i just cant thank him enough for saving my babys life
1281971 this machine is only being used on the tiniest earliest babies where there is nothing else that can be done
1281972 this does not mean we are not prepared to be as strong as it takes to get a successful resolution he wrote in an email to members
1281973 the spl are not taking us seriously and are in for a real shock which im sure setanta with their big bucks will not be happy about one told the daily record be prepared unless the spl have a major rethink of fees saturdays fixtures are in doubt
1281974 a series of discussions have taken place and we expect the matter to be resolved soon
1281975 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1281976 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1281977 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1281978 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1281979 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1281980 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1281981 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1281982 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1281983 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1281984 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1281985 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1281986 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1281987 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1281988 being furloughed twice in such a short period of time especially when its so easily avoidable would be a tremendous hardship for these pilots and their families
1281989 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel
1281990 an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened
1281991 we take such allegations seriously i havent spoken to anyone to find out what was allegedly said
1281992 miley is hosting i am rooting for her but she is battling my dance crew
1281993 he certainly didnt get rich doing it his wife was buried in a paupers grave
1281994 we have been advised that six foot is not large for a boa constrictor however people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite
1281995 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers
1281996 i want to find out as well when they think i can play again my hope is that it will be before christmas
1281997 the worst part is over and i have had a lot of difficulties to overcome since the beginning but right now i am very happy with the progress i am making
1281998 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again
1281999 yes it can be difficult at times because i have never been through something like this before
1282000 i am still trying to get my focus back but the worst part is done with that was the initial injury and the early rehabilitation i will try to come back as fast as i can and make sure i can play well when i do
1282001 i hope that i will know exactly how long it will take me to be back in training with my team mates
1282002 i want to find out as well when they think i can play again my hope is that it will be before christmas
1282003 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from tenth
1282004 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012 we are confident we will move forward from tenth but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1282005 at athens the combined margin of five british golds being silver medals was only 0 545sec that shows how close it can be
1282006 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100 million a year taken from motorists how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1282007 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1282008 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1282009 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1282010 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1282011 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1282012 without building him up bopara too much there is definitely something there and he has got the potential to be extremely good
1282013 ravi has earned the right to play he didnt perform as well as he would have liked in sri lanka maybe it was a wake up call for him
1282014 i think it was a bit of a reality check regarding just how tough cricket can be but he has gone back to essex this summer and you cant argue with anything he has done
1282015 he is one of the leading first class run scorers this season so he demands to be picked
1282016 he also got a double hundred in a one day game with leicestershire not many people have done that not even the great graham gooch
1282017 when i saw ravi as a youngster at 18 he was the most talented youngster ive ever seen now he is learning how to develop that talent into scoring runs
1282018 without building him up too much there is definitely something there and he has got the potential to be extremely good
1282019 every time you see a funeral procession so goes another am listener
1282020 at this point the humane thing to do would be to pull the plug and put beck and innocent tv viewers out of their misery

1282056 vast array of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics anti convulsants mood stabilizers and sex hormones have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million americans
1282057 over the past five years the number of u s prescriptions rose 12 to a record 3 7 billion while non prescription drug purchases held steady around 3 3 billion according to ims health and the nielsen co
1282058 evidence that adding chlorine a common process in conventional drinking water treatment plants makes some pharmaceuticals more toxic
1282059 he doesnt get a lot of headlines but he is one of the key players at qualcomm
1282060 hes a great operations guy and qualcomm is a great training ground
1282061 but im surprised they did not pick someone with more imagination in devices im not sure whether a semiconductor guy does the trick can he green light the next five great devices consumers want
1282062 but i would not have taken this job if i did not believe in the organization
1282063 he sees things for what they are and changes things that need to be changed
1282064 i am optimistic that we will be good partners so collectively we make better decisions
1282065 you get in line you tow the line or youre just out of it bud
1282066 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it if we could create nato to face down the soviet union we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman in london and bali in washington and new york
1282067 america cannot do this alone the afghan people need our troops and your troops our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaida
1282068 the poverty and violence in somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow
1282069 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common
1282070 america is part of what has gone wrong in our world
1282071 the genocide in darfur shames the conscience of us all
1282072 europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world
1282073 that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
1282074 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
1282075 this is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons this is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons
1282076 there is no doubt that general muhammad suleiman is the closest person to bashar al assad and is his right hand in the armed forces and he knows everything
1282077 he has all the files security financial and army reform
1282078 its better to wait three or four days until the indications appear in this or that direction particularly because the assassination took place in a very precise way
1282079 as with everybody else it seems i cannot help but connect suleimans assassination to an ongoing attempt at eliminating people who have sensitive information on the lebanese file and syrias involvement there perhaps even the assassination of hariri et al
1282080 it seems that the indictment issued against president omar bashir of sudan by the international criminal court for genocide crimes against humanity and murder might have had a psychological impact here after all the tribunal is still the main threat against the regime
1282081 its really all wild speculation there is a big propaganda machine that would use something like this to imply that the regime is falling apart i think there will be a lot of speculation about this and all of it will be uninformed or misleading
1282082 a sea of tranquility in the middle east fraught with extremism factionalism and al qaida type elements
1282083 this is a police state and security is above everything in this sense its not going good for the regime
1282084 was at the heart of the regime and israel is in negotiations with syria and this is not the time to do it
1282085 normally israel would exhaust all possibilities to damage the regime but not now

1282107 it was definitely a hard decision to make and hell have a hard task to follow thats for sure
1282108 the first thing that he will have to do is earn the respect of the players we know he is a very good player and his batting prowess has already brought him repsect hes just got to get that as captain now
1282109 it affects different people in different ways i found it quite helpful being captain but graham gooch and ian botham didnt find it easy juggling the two roles
1282110 lets hope he can do it because we need to start winning again
1282111 i am sure that the selectors sat down long and hard to make this decision its not something that they will have taken lightly
1282112 if he starts to bat well for yorkshire then we wont have seen the last of michael vaughan we hope he comes back
1282113 hes done a great job for england and i think theres a few runs left in him
1282114 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1282115 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1282116 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1282117 stephen roche and i have just been watching this day not dissimilar to other days when they go fast fall off and come in to the finish

1282119 la 17e conf rence mondiale sur le sida qui sest ouverte dimanche 3 ao t mexico et durera jusquau 8 ao t d but des jeux olympiques de p kin

1282121 a la fois cest un succ s et en m me temps un chec
1282122 onze ou douze pays nous ont suivis les autres nous ont tous dit oui mais les ministres de finances des pays ensuite ont bloqu parce quils ne voulaient pas dun imp t de plus
1282123 jai fait plusieurs fois le tour du monde plusieurs fois on ma dit bravo mais plusieurs fois aussi on ma dit cest pas possible cest trop t t
1282124 aux sommets du g8 de juillet 2007 et juillet 2008 nicolas sarkozy sest engag en faveur de lacc s universel au traitement du sida dici 2010 2 dapr s lonusida cela implique le triplement du nombre de malades sous traitement dans les pays pauvres 10 millions de personnes
1282125 la pr sence du ministre des affaires trang res bernard kouchner simposait
1282126 kouchner on ne la jamais entendu sur le sida je lui ai crit il ma r pondu quil n tait pas comp tent sur ce sujet et ma renvoy vers rama yade cest pourtant son r le d tre mexico son absence est tonnante vu ses combats il se devrait d tre pr sent quand il tait dans lopposition il donnait des le ons aux autres sur ce sujet et depuis quil est ministre on ne lentend plus

1282129 there was no fuselage at the pentagone there was none that could check out they said it vaporized and yet they produced bodies saying that they didnt vaporize you can vaporize a two ton engine i dont think so you can see the pictures of the pentagone destruction its a solid hole no plane does damage like that it was a bomb
1282130 and a lot of people say they closed the twin towers for weekends on end directly before 9 11 and wouldnt let the security people in there because they were setting it up for demolition
1282131 it was even admitted that the motivation for the gulf war in kuwait was a total lie that got us to establish our army base in saudi arabia its all about the oil companies
1282132 they need to question the news they need to question authority
1282133 they know where osama bin laden is hes in pakistan the pakistani government knows where he is we know where he is the pakistani government says he can exist as long he doesnt cause trouble come on hes an agent for us
1282134 we are saving time money and resources when we train together and follow the same procedures
1282135 and we have complete integration of our emergency operations center incident command structure and command and control were one of the first command posts in the air force to fully integrate
1282136 this means we can quickly respond to incidents affecting the active duty and reserve wings
1282137 we are almost identical in structure and this allows members to swap out with other shift controllers
1282138 we run 24 7 with a high ops tempo so its critical we have seamless integration
1282139 its easier to coordinate joint operations with aircrews brief them on any plan and ensure airborne operations run smoothly
1282140 we have one of the best flightline video systems in the air force
1282141 our multiple cameras cover the entire airfield which is more than four square miles
1282142 and were a test base for the guardian program a security program designed specifically for the modern terrorist environment
1282143 weve got years of talent and corporate knowledge to glean from
1282144 the key to our total force integration success story is attitude
1282145 the pope command post is one unified team and were in it to win it our active duty airmen have put in long hours and our reservists have stepped up in order to make our mission successful by concentrating on our similarities and common guideposts weve been able to focus on the meat of the mission and achieve success together forging the road to the future

1282151 im concerned that if he returns he will continue in the actions that bring us here today
1282152 he is not a threat and he is not a flight risk
1282153 what were trying to do is put more teeth into our ordinance
1282154 what were trying to do is put more teeth into our ordinance
1282155 well have to talk to the father some more to try to get to the bottom of this
1282156 when i looked around i saw families enjoying the exhibits
1282157 were in the process of trying to figure it out this is a big loss for the community
1282158 i still wake every hour i see fire and his face behind it
1282159 he left austins three children in the burning house when he fled
1282160 i tried to get up and he pushed me back down and then i tried to get up again and then he started swinging and punching me i started blocking my face then i fell down again
1282161 i burned my hands trying to put the fire out then he went to tamika he put a lot on her
1282162 i didnt even know i was stabbed thats why my lung collapsed
1282163 i didnt find out she was dead until the next day we have no idea no clue why he did it maybe it was something personal between them
1282164 were still trying to sort out what happened obviously there was a disagreement of some kind
1282165 what the motive was that prompted the stabbing is unclear but the detectives are still following up leads and interviewing witnesses
1282166 once youre involved youre committed its a discipline i enjoy the cross training and the wanderlust going to other places and learning about them

1282184 our pc 12 customers have provided us with some very specific and helpful feedback with regard to their training needs
1282185 for example many of our customers asked us to minimize the amount of time they spend away from their home and or office for training to accommodate that request we have developed a pre study course for the initial training program whereby we will send courseware to customers that will familiarize them with the apex system prior to getting into the simulator in addition to decreasing the amount of time they spend away for training the pre study course will better prepare them for and will also enhance their simulator experience

1282189 is to some extent a real plan and to some extent its a pentagon wish list
1282190 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
1282191 being furloughed twice in such a short period of time especially when its so easily avoidable would be a tremendous hardship for these pilots and their families
1282192 this is just a clever way of telling their members they think they can forgo voluntary overtime without telling them directly which might be illegal
1282193 we can take credit for the shoe leather police work that was involved
1282194 like i said at the sentencing if he put his ingenuity to good use mr nhin would be a successful person
1282195 keeping track of who did what with what car all the different vietnamese names and similar kinds of cars it was very difficult to sort out
1282196 were still trying to sort out what happened obviously there was a disagreement of some kind
1282197 what the motive was that prompted the stabbing is unclear but the detectives are still following up leads and interviewing witnesses

1282218 i cant do this now ill have to suck it up and deal with this emotion later
1282219 it was the israeli bombing of a civilian target at qana which prompted the occupation of the raytheon plant
1282220 this was the basis of the defence which the dawc members put before the crown court in belfast the court accepted this defence and found that the action of the raytheon 9 was not a crime but an attempt to prevent crime
1282221 it has been a source of frustration to us that no media outlet has provided its readers listeners or viewers with a straightforward account of why the nine were acquitted questions should be asked about this
1282222 it was crucial to the defence case that the derry plant not just the raytheon company internationally was involved in aiding and abetting crimes under international humanitarian law
1282223 we say that the time has now come to end this shameful silence raytheon should be told to get out of derry
1282224 we call on rank and file members and supporters of the sdlp sinn fein the dup and the ulster unionists to tell their leaders to tell this company that it is not welcome here
1282225 this is not a local issue but a national and international issue the arms trade fuels war for profit opponents of the arms trade everywhere in the world will be boosted if derry tells raytheon to get out
1282226 as we said outside the court at the close of the raytheon 9 trial the people of lebanon are our neighbours
1282227 we in derry should remember the names of those who died at qana on july 30th 2006

1282236 what i thought was a bit of fluff turned out to be a rabbits bottom stuck up in the air
1282237 every time i loosened the gravel by hand i found something else moving and found another rabbit they were alive but groggy and cold
1282238 one of the lads got a sweat shirt from his van and wrapped them up and we rubbed them a bit to keep them warm and bring them round

1282244 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1282245 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1282246 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1282247 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do

1282263 interest in derivatives is certainly gaining ground in the region growth has also been supported by the recent introduction of crude oil futures which has attracted substantial interest from the region and beyond
1282264 the addition of crude oil to our already strong markets in precious metals and currencies has highlighted our commitment to providing our customers with a broad portfolio of products with which to manage their price risk

1282268 we have been asking for it and are pleased research has finally begun
1282269 i have seen morgellons disease kill not just my friend but in the hospital where i work
1282270 i hate waking up and pulling the covers off me and checking my skin every day to see what new horror is possibly there
1282271 my father wont talk to me because he feels that my mother could have lived the last days of her life without having to worry about me and this crazy disease
1282272 i can almost predict the outcome especially if this is an older show
1282273 they will look at all of the previously published research in a very logical and methodical way and perhaps mention the cdc study and say we will just have to wait and see what their conclusions are before we decide
1282274 this is a story you will hear again and again for those with this disease
1282275 we have to bring awareness that this is real and it is spreading we have a huge problem and it is being ignored
1282276 a doctor told me that if it is not in the medical books or journals then it does not exist and that he could not treat what does not exist

1282282 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen

1282289 dont let nov 4 find you on the open road
1282290 as a career military man it sickens me that our boys are dying in iraq

1282300 it is a fantastic boost for our newspapers to bring in someone of hannahs calibre
1282301 she has a proven track record as a journalist and is clearly highly passionate about our titles
1282302 the hard part is the 46 games it is more mental for everyone keeping 100 per cent focused throughout the season and getting yourself up for games as you are not going to man united and liverpool
1282303 the opposition got progressively harder for everybody its about getting fit for this weekend we know how long the season is
1282304 it is going to be a test for everybody mentally physically we need to peak at the right time
1282305 its a different position for hunty so it is always more difficult
1282306 but when we had the ball him and bobby partnered up really well bobby got a ton of crosses in and i thought we were super solid
1282307 we made a lot of changes in the second half but still played well we should have won
1282308 it was about time this maximum has been a long time in coming
1282309 i admit i havent been pulling my weight in recent weeks so i am well pleased tonight we have been working hard on my bikes and this was a different engine i used tonight
1282310 i also feel fitter in myself i had an injury early in the season and it took quite a bit out of me
1282311 the boys have been a bit down after two bad away scores
1282312 we have had some tough times but the boys showed some real determination tonight and that will boost the confidence levels as we prepare to challenge somerset here on sunday
1282313 i hope this is the ticket to get the ball rolling
1282314 it is always nice to get a maximum or paid maximum
1282315 i had a good weekend as i scored a paid maximum in the conference league yesterday
1282316 it is all about confidence and it showed on the track today i have some great equipment at the moment which helps
1282317 i am absolutely disgusted they have treated us like this
1282318 we have all bought clothes and hats and were looking forward to a nice day out
1282319 they have been ignorant and brazen and dont deserve to call themselves a company imagine the disappointment if it had been a wedding party
1282320 i spoke to them and they were just not interested and did not care
1282321 my job is stressful at work but this has been more stressful i am very cut up and upset about the whole thing

1282323 firstly we at no point have we been rude to the clients
1282324 they were obviously very upset with the problems experienced and we apologised from the outset
1282325 the driver didnt arrive for work with no phone call to us whatsoever leaving us no time to sort out a replacement driver
1282326 we tried all morning to find another local company to supply another coach with no success being peak season
1282327 we will be issuing the driver in question with a written warning as this is completely unacceptable and puts our company in a bad light

1282330 tomorrow will represent another big day in the history of berkshire county cricket club when the side takes on devon in the final of the minor counties knock out trophy at lords 11am start it will be the countys second appearance in a lords final following their victory in the same competition in 2004 and there is every possibility of the present team repeating that success playing in a cup final anywhere is a big enough occasion but to do so at the home of cricket is the stuff of dreams for an amateur cricketer because of the aura and history of the place nerves will play a part on this massive stage and this is where the berkshire team will have an advantage over their opponents so many of this team have been there before skipper bjorn mordt steve naylor carl crowe and tom lambert are still in the side that defeated northumberland by seven wickets four years ago while james morris was 12th man of the others mitchell stokes and jonno mclean have been at the home of cricket in their time as professionals and of course berkshire professional richard johnson the former middlesex star will need no introduction to the place as he spent most of his working life there interestingly two players who have not appeared at hq before could be the barometers of this final david barnes and paul carter carter will play his cricket the same way wherever he is totally unflappable he will appreciate the enormity of the occasion but he will approach the game wherever he is called into it in his own way barnes all northern grit and determination will not allow such a game to go by without a massive attempt to leave his mark on it opening at lords will have been on the reading skippers mind since his courageous semi final effort at banbury last month tomorrow so what of tomorrows tie first of all berkshire have already put devon through the mill in a group game earlier this season mclean 147 and barnes 86 put on 170 for the second wicket as berks raced to 308 4 in 50 overs before going on to win comfortably by 82 runs that match in may will be on the minds of both teams but for quite different reasons it is good for berkshire to have recent success against their final opponents and to be able to recall that experience however they should be wary of how it will be used as a motivational factor by devon a talented team quite capable of putting a game out of sight themselves devon have an excellent record in the one day competition winning the trophy in 1992 1994 and 1998 berkshires strength lies in the all round ability and flexibility of the team just as it did in 2004 a reliable opening pair is followed by a talented middle order with depth to the batting the seam attack is capable of doing a job on its own but there is variety in the spin department as well

1282364 we simply dont have to choose between hayek and former soviet president leonid brezhnev
1282365 we explicitly reject hayeks view that society has no obligation to others who are unknown to us and hayeks preparedness to allow fundamental social institutions like the family to fend entirely for themselves against unrestrained market forces that is why for example we have a different approach to industrial relations because we believe families need certain fundamental protections in the workplace

1282400 im very disappointed about the latest statement made by mr khamenei about their intention to continue in any case with the nuclear program of enrichment of uranium
1282401 the iranian nation by depending on its useful experience and advantages of 30 years of resistance does not pay any attention to such talk and will continue with its path
1282402 we have not found any legal technical justification for stopping or suspension of any of our nuclear activity
1282403 britain france germany and italy wanted to be robust and go beyond u n security council resolution 1803 and implement what they had to sacrifice to russia and china to get it through the security council
1282404 one should not spoil negotiations by raising unreasonable conditions since iranians are not ready to deviate from their rights by one iota
1282405 any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear facilities
1282406 todays bulldozer attack is a reminder of what israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long
1282407 i strongly condemn this attack and will always support israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security
1282408 the israeli government is unsettled the palestinians are divided between fatah and hamas and so its difficult for either side to make the bold move that would bring about peace
1282409 he goes to work in the morning and comes back in the evening he has no other activities
1282410 we are surprised by what happened we do not know what went wrong
1282411 this was another attempt to murder innocent people in a senseless act of terrorism
1282412 a natural reaction to the crimes of the israeli occupation
1282413 i realized dave had the glint in his eye and the hunger to run for the job so i stepped away from running
1282414 mr osborne as general election coordinator has made a large share of the biggest strategic decisions over the last year shaking up campaign boris hiring andy coulson making the inheritance tax promise
1282415 but osborne is supposed to be the shadow chancellor trying to map our way out of this economic mess not some political bag man for cameron
1282416 hes not going anywhere do whatever you are going to do
1282417 i need the police im at the harbor steps apartments on the 1st avenue side im not sure what the address is but im standing on 1st av and im north of seneca im being assaulted by a transient looking male who just said he was going to beat me and my girlfriend hes already shoved me and punched me three times he has not displayed any weapons he is a white male 40s 5 8 medium build with sunglasses and hes wearing a yellow windbreaker and dirty blue jeans

1282446 from what i understood at that time that was the worst accident that wasnt fatal in u s diving
1282447 i dont know if that was true but it was a horrific accident
1282448 it was a part of my life that happened but there are many experiences that have influenced the person i am today
1282449 there were a lot of coaches who werent sure how good she was going to be because of the accident
1282450 kenny said i guaranteed shes one of the best divers ive ever coached in my life
1282451 you just knew she was going to be an olympian some day there was no doubt in my mind
1282452 you could watch her develop over a substantial period of time months and even years as she re learned the courage that it took for her to get back on the board
1282453 in many ways i wanted to show everyone that people can go through adverse times and come through successful at the end of it
1282454 i can remember so many times saying nancilea lets go do so and so and shed say no i need to exercise i need to focus
1282455 she said every practice i miss is a practice ill never make up
1282456 my belief is that she has a really good chance to get on the podium
1282457 the big moment for me though will be when she steps on that board the first time representing her country
1282458 im very pleased when you consider all the natural disasters the floods the tornados and certainly the general state of the economy
1282459 were doing well but not as well as we were doing at this time last year
1282460 certainly the combination of the way last year ended i think we all felt sickened by that and then the economy
1282461 were not ahead of where we were a year ago
1282462 we have incredible fans and weve had 30 straight sellouts
1282463 it gets to me when people try to think this is the magic thing
1282464 youve still got to remember that the game of football is about people its not about systems
1282465 until that quarterback takes the ball and they have plays designed for him to run it its not a spread offense its just a one back offense
1282466 peyton manning is that a spread offense hes got three wideouts but they dont have pre designed runs for him so thats not a spread offense
1282467 its those quarterbacks that take off and run with the ball now youve got a spread offense now youve got another problem but theres not as many of those as everybody likes to believe they see three wideouts and they think ooh spread offense its not a spread its a one back offense
1282468 i dont know how many really true spread offenses there are
1282469 offensive coaches to be fancy someone says what kind of offense do your run oh we run a spread
1282470 its a one back offense its been there for 20 years
1282471 i dont know how to do anything else and my wife hates me so i cant retire
1282472 i have great faith in the leadership of the conference that it will get done it just cant get done soon enough
1282473 if he can get them resolved well welcome him back to the team
1282474 it wont be in camp were moving on right now were only allowed 105 spots he has not trained with our guys he hasnt been in the summer program like the other guys so there are way too many variables so whenever he gets them resolved i know hes working real hard and wed love to have him back but realistically we need to focus on moving forward with the group thats been here
1282475 were trying to move forward with our season with our off the field behavior with our conduct with all that
1282476 all we have to do is give our fans and our community a winning season and theyll forgive us i promise you that
1282477 every player has had enough of the negative attention and everybody is dying to have a winning season theyre so hungry for a bowl game
1282478 whether theyre driven by the bowl gifts the ring the attention the media we want to get back there but for me i want the fans of iowa to have something to walk around and hold their heads up about i want to see them out and theyre so astonished and theyre in love with the fact that were giving the state of iowa attention in a positive way so they can be proud fans again
1282479 at the time last year when guys were getting injured and getting banged up it looked like a curse almost we couldnt catch a break
1282480 but now looking back at it a lot of guys got experience a lot of guys who wouldve been really young arent quite as young with some of the time they played last year weve got a lot coming back on offense weve got a good core coming back on defense and weve got every reason to think weve got a chance to be pretty competitive this year and play well
1282481 certainly we have more depth and experience than weve probably had any of the nine years ive been here at that position
1282482 i dont know if we have a robert gallery or eric steinbach those guys are elite players they turned out to be elite players they certainly werent as younger players but i think weve got a group that can be pretty good but now weve got to get that work done
1282483 its been pretty well documented that i didnt play as well as i should have last year
1282484 it was a learning experience and its going to make me that much better
1282485 well thanks to the fans you only have to type three letters
1282486 when youre inexperienced at talking you say things that arent necessarily the right things to say everything you say reflects on your whole entire program
1282487 when youre focused those kinds of things can never break your mental state
1282488 i put it behind me the day after it happened
1282489 my whole reasoning for coming nine and a half hours away from home is to be a hawkeye and be the best hawkeye i can be so im definitely not going to waste my time getting into trouble off the field and doing things that are going to reflect on our coaches and our community in a negative way
1282490 an internet legend i dont know if im excited about that
1282491 id rather be an on the field legend but youve got to start somewhere i guess
1282492 we dont ask for it but i know one thing when there is hype it motivates you it sets a spark under you like youve got to go everybody wants to be the guy the big play guy the star of the team
1282493 but right now i just want to put myself in the best position possible to succeed so if there is going to be hype which obviously there was hype its my responsibility to live up to it
1282494 and im ok with that because im on this football team for a reason and thats to be productive and if youre not going to be productive youre not going to be on the field
1282495 i came here and i was just so intrigued by how much the fans were just so invested in the football team
1282496 you could see it in their eyes any chance you had to interact with them
1282497 and for me that motivates the hell out of me when i see them and how much they put forth and how much they want to see victories that makes me work harder because they deserve wins they deserve bowl games and they deserve to take trips to warmer parts of the country
1282498 i want to be the guy who wins the game for us who makes the big plays for us and whos accountable in a crucial situation
1282499 so im going to give myself the best chance to be that guy
1282500 and thats what im doing now and thats what im going to do for these next three weeks youve got to put the cell phone down put down the magazines im big on tabloids i love tabloids its just got to be football around the clock for three weeks
1282501 i dont know when its going to happen but when it does youll say that was the moment right there
1282502 its crazy and its been like that since i was a little boy
1282503 for some reason people think i need a nickname my first name is just not enough
1282504 it was just time because i was going to college legal reasons and that
1282505 it was just time for me to do it before being sent off to college
1282506 because of the media the name is out there theres been contact from my biological family
1282507 you cant explain decisions that are made but i dont have any beef
1282508 ive never seen a guy work so hard off the field behind closed doors to make this program be prestigious
1282509 and i dont think he gets enough credit as far as character goes his picture should be in the dictionary next to the word because if he doesnt have anything else he has that
1282510 theres only so much guidance a coach can give you
1282511 it comes down to every guy knows right from wrong if youre 18 19 20 plus years old and you dont know right from wrong by now then you certainly shouldnt be playing for this program every incident thats happened you make a decision and its either a good decision or a bad decision
1282512 guys have been getting caught and they continue to take chances and they continue to reflect on our program in a negative way its got to stop and its going to stop right now were at a point where the realization is setting in that were being looked at in a very negative way throughout the country
1282513 i think the biggest thing for him is just realizing hes a sophomore
1282514 hes got a lot of talent hes got some experience and hes had some success
1282515 but thats where it ends and this year is a completely different year i had a great year my sophomore year there at the end but like that it can end and you can have an injury so as long as he keeps his head on his shoulders hell be fine
1282516 io e te non ci siamo gi visti da qualche parte
1282517 oh maybe ill use this oh wait now i have to spend all this time trying to use this

1282559 every day the habitat of provincially listed endangered butterflies is disappearing
1282560 i didnt find a single butterfly in the last 10 years its been getting worse and worse this year seems to be the worst ever

1282567 that they should repent and turn to god and do works becoming or befitting for repentance
1282568 in other words works are the evidence of saving faith not a means to salvation the
1282569 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
1282570 shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
1282571 in acts 26 20 are not two separate events but one and the same proponents of the
1282572 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty
1282573 i e a turning from the guilt and realized condemnation which sin brings
1282574 to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
1282575 is not even found in the gospel book of john
1282576 to repent literally means to have a change of mind or spirit toward god and toward sin it means to turn from your sins earnestly with all your heart and trust in jesus christ to save you you can see then how the man who believes in christ repents and the man who repents believes in christ the jailer repented when he turned from sin to believe in the lord jesus christ
1282577 which brother rice speaks of is only in the sense of a realization of ones guilt not actually ceasing from committing sin

1282769 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1282770 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
1282771 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1282772 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1282773 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

1282783 it is true we are one of the most important teams in the race but germany and italy are also strong
1282784 i think here we are all mentally well prepared and everyone is going to try their best
1282785 for many of us it is the last time we will compete in the olympic games so we will approach it with more intensity and more emotion
1282786 any one of the five of us could win a medal but the most important thing is that one of us wins for our country
1282787 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1282788 iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia
1282789 while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1282802 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1282803 this is a tragedy for the athlete this kind of suspicion not just in cycling but any sport its bad and it can distract from a desired result
1282804 we believe him we have faith but who knows maybe in the technical data something will show up
1282805 he spent a lot of time at altitude and his body was attuned to elevation where there is less oxygen that alone has the effect of changing blood indicators but all we can do now is wait and follow procedures

1282821 paranoja po moje isto mogo a darja2 razen da slabo
1282822 odgovor na zadnje prebrano vpra anje je obi ajno v
1282823 this time we will fight decisively to achieve our ends
1282824 the nwfp government has deceived us by launching the military operation and we will avenge it for this it is following washingtons policies but we will continue to fight against united states both in pakistan and afghanistan
1282825 they are in the mountains and they are in the villages among the civilian population
1282826 the military is using gunship helicopters to flush them away but sometimes it kills more civilians than the taliban
1282827 it creates resentment among the local population and the government should consider this issue seriously
1282828 i fail to understand how you can sign peace with a group that is adamant on bringing destruction to the region and its people
1282829 we are virtually at the brink of a civil war
1282830 it the military fails to curb militancy then i fear people themselves will fight for their survival they have no other choice
1282831 now increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuel efficient and transition to other renewable american made sources of energy
1282832 but it is not the solution it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades
1282833 i also believe that in the short term as we transition to renewable energy we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas
1282834 but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but havent touched and if they dont we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will
1282835 all parts of the west and central gulf of mexico
1282836 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production
1282837 and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1282838 its a comprehensive effort that was realistic about the ability to move the united states away from the dangerous reliance on imported oil toward cleaner technologies and cleaner energy in the future
1282839 its an aggressive plan and his goal is to leave our dependence by 2025
1282840 assertion that he can take off the table new natural gas take off the table new oil supplies take off the table nuclear power take off the table building coal powered power plants and somehow in 10 years will relieve the united states of its reliance of imported oil is utterly unrealistic
1282841 so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1282842 once we have a new president and more forward thinking members in the house and senate we dont believe we will need a compromise on off shore drilling which will be yet another give away to big oil and will provide no relief for hard hit consumers
1282843 we will resist any effort to pay this ransom that george bush john mccain and big oil are demanding in exchange for the release of real investments in clean renewable energy
1282844 alternative and renewable energy sources have received many billions of dollars
1282845 this looks a lot like those policies that continuously havent worked the only short term answer is to produce more oil
1282846 leftwing forces here have persistently tried to associate anti american sentiment with each conflict arising from short term issues involving south korea and the u s
1282847 these incidents ended up escalating to a scale tens or even hundreds of times larger than their original size shaking the entire country
1282848 rallies in south korea are a sign of a mature democracy
1282849 we have no problem at all with the fact that the south korean people want to provide their opinion
1282850 while there may be some people who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the south korean supermarket shelves
1282851 it would certainly result in a great deal of polarization in the community
1282852 i think the community cares very very much about it and ive heard reports about radio broadcasters and others wanting to chain themselves to the cross that people want to lay in front of the bulldozers
1282853 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily non religious messages of military service death and sacrifice
1282854 the primary effect of the mount soledad memorial is patriotic and nationalistic
1282855 the first phase was directed against the city of san diego because it had a park on mt soledad on which the cross was situated the plaintiffs were alleging violation of the california constitution because of the presence of a religious symbol in a public park
1282856 it will remain a federal monument no matter what happens to the cross so the issue now really centers on whether a federal monument can contain a cross as one of its elements honoring veterans
1282857 the mount soledad veterans memorial remains a proud fixture within the san diego community
1282858 it stands to represent the service and sacrifice of our nations veterans and the recent court ruling reaffirms this fact
1282859 sadly i fully expect the aclu attorneys to appeal this decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals so this fight is not over
1282860 it does not follow the cross has no other meaning or significance
1282861 it means different things to different people but it has certainly been a landmark for la jolla certainly my entire life i was born in 1951
1282862 it was simply wrong for congress to take a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil
1282863 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy
1282864 theres no question that these calls are privileged and we rely on that because the criminal justice system would come to a screeching halt if we had to drive to the jail every time we had to talk to our clients
1282865 anyone could call and ask that their numbers be added to the database but the problem was that we didnt do as much as we could have in publicizing this fact
1282866 the first thing you hear when you pick up the phone is that your call can be recorded
1282867 if you didnt register your phone number with the list then you didnt do your job the onus is on you
1282868 a substantial opportunity exists to provide data to both chinese and united states agencies and companies that seek to serve the chinese market
1282869 current information on where population growth is occurring in china is critical in predicting environmental impacts of increased urbanization and energy usage
1282870 a better understanding of the current age sex distribution and other characteristics of the population will facilitate planning and resource allocation for services such as health care education housing and humanitarian aid
1282871 current data on the spatial distribution of population in a gis geodemographic information system format is critical in planning and evaluating needs for health social and commercial services
1282872 party members hold almost all top government police and military positions
1282873 the chinese government continued its coercive birth limitation policy in some cases resulting in forced abortion and sterilization
1282874 this project is not involved with the collection of any data only the use of existing publicly available information like census figures and satellite photos
1282875 this existing data will be used to chart overall population change from certain rural to urban areas of jiangxi province from 2000 to 2006
1282876 certainly retailers or restaurants who are expanding into china would be able to use the information
1282877 we also realize information can be used by government agencies and relief agencies
1282878 please dont take this the wrong way but thats a little silly
1282879 the chinese government has much more detailed figures available than anything they would release publicly i doubt our project would interest them our work is of interest to organizations like the international red cross
1282880 over 50 000 townships with approximately 1 500 unique data items will be delivered in a geodemographic information system producing estimates at the township and 1km grid levels
1282881 public health research consists of assessing and monitoring the health of communities and populations to identify health problems and priorities
1282882 information from this project will be useful for tracking and responding to disease planning for community medical needs and responding to natural disasters
1282883 the data would be available to the general public including international relief organizations businesses and international public health groups
1282884 the datas utility to the chinese and u s governments presumably would be very limited as both governments already have more refined data at their disposal
1282885 its almost a stronger control in urban areas than in rural areas
1282886 these things are shown in the data that ive been analyzing you can really see the effect of certain policies throughout the last 40 or 50 years
1282887 if you know the counts of populations of certain ages you can sort of back track and say there is a lack of certain people here because of this policy coming in at a certain time period its pretty interesting that dry data can show so much history
1282888 we require that the media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games
1282889 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and have remained unchanged since the ioc entered into the host city contract with beijing in 2001 that is the extent of our remit in this area
1282890 if the entire world had been pressuring china since 2001 even before these games were assigned to beijing the situation might have been different today and perhaps imprisoned journalists would have been freed before the opening ceremony
1282891 just like other countries china regulates the internet according to law
1282892 the chinese laws forbid anyone to spread illegal information such as preaching an evil cult like the falun gong or do anything that harms national interests through the internet
1282893 although it may be possible for a new u s administration to repudiate the disastrous bush policy
1282894 a tremendous amount of damage will already have been done

1282908 if you leave trees there for a long period of time you only get the carbon thats stored in them once
1282909 nowhere near the destruction that nafi including timber giant gunns is wreaking day by day in the forests of australia these great living natural carbon banks
1282910 the destruction of these carbon banks and the wildlife the rare flora and water catchments has got to stop
1282911 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1282912 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1282913 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1282914 her recovery will be a long process and she is getting all the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step of the way
1282915 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1282916 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues
1282917 weve got to be quite concerned about the compulsory nature of unit pricing on small independent retailers and grocers throughout the country
1282918 we know that coles and woolworths and franklins are able to and some of them have already started to move in the direction of unit pricing but youve got to be very concerned about the impact on small retailers and small grocers throughout australia
1282919 unit pricing will help consumers make significant savings if they use it to pursue the best value between brands and supermarkets
1282920 australian consumers would significantly benefit if coles and woolworths faced more competitive threats that encouraged more aggressive pricing strategies
1282921 i saw a picture of myself it looked like it was taken at blacktown station and then i didnt know what to do after that
1282922 i told my parents its not me please believe me
1282923 i told them that it wasnt me i told them to get more hard evidence but they said theyve got all the evidence that they needed thats it
1282924 i was about to break down i didnt know what to do
1282925 police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1282926 i had never been to a court before i was just so confused and shocked

1282929 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
1282930 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
1282931 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
1282932 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
1282933 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1282934 we think economic factors and our customers shopping preferences should determine the location of our supermarkets not additional regulation that creates more red tape
1282935 his courageous contribution to world literature has left an indelible mark on our times and his legacy will endure far into the future
1282936 to seek clearance for anything they say that draws on the experience they had in their entire careers
1282937 would among other things prevent any live tv or radio commentary from former diplomats for the rest of their lives they would thus substantially diminish informed discussion of major world events
1282938 this box set is carltons biggest publishing venture as its official and were in association with the imperial war museum we have access to rare documents and memorabilia never been printed before
1282939 as internet devices continue to evolve screens get larger and connectivity gets faster the ability to access
1282940 we believe small portable devices ranging from mobile phones to subnotebooks will be increasingly used as advanced productivity devices and by enabling those devices to reach host computers they become even more useful these mobile devices lack the computing resources of a powerful desktop pc but via remote access the user of a mobile device does not need to be limited by a slow cpu and the lack of storage
1282941 the uk does not offer support to committees and organisations that are against bahrain and its leadership
1282942 nor does it support violent groups that cause public disruption by terrorist acts
1282943 the uk does not tolerate incitement of violence and will act according to the law against those who do so
1282944 there is a long history of mutual co operation and friendship from which both our countries have benefited
1282945 such a meeting would reflect this and the growing relationships between the bahraini and uk parliaments which are strongly supported by the british embassy
1282946 the strength of our relationship with bahrain is also seen in areas of commerce travel and tourism study and co operation in facing the challenges of the 21st century
1282947 the uk government will continue working to ensure that this relationship remains a success
1282948 is in a good position to take advantage of opportunities to continue building market share and hire top talent

1282953 there seems to be a little respite for the service sector with the overall business activity index bouncing back unexpectedly
1282954 but it remains in weak territory and certainly in our view does not mark a turning point in the sectors fortunes
1282955 while services activity fell at a slower rate during july the risks to future trends in the sector remained clearly skewed to the downside
1282956 the record contraction in new business severe cost pressures and deteriorating sentiment all point to the continuation of difficult times ahead

1282959 it makes sense that adecco would look to buy michael page as they are mainly in specialist staffing and this is an area that adecco is wanting to move into
1282960 but michael page could be too big for adecco and could cause problems in terms of the integration
1282961 the board of michael page continues to believe that the company has a very strong future as an independent group
1282962 there can be no certainty that an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made even if the pre conditions are satisfied or waived
1282963 the growing momentum behind this company after two years of repositioning our brand and reinventing the guest experience
1282964 declined in appeal to research providers and not attracted firms in sufficient numbers to generate innovation on a whole of industry basis
1282965 we can develop more breakthroughs for industry if we focus on problems rather than look at a domain in a grand sense
1282966 it is time to move crcs back to being end user focused research joint ventures in which the collaborating parties work together to a purpose which is mutually beneficial with resources they contribute themselves with some help from the commonwealth rather than as independent research organisations focusing on research commercialisation and adoption and funded by public and private sector partners and the commonwealth
1282967 nothing pleases me more than adding hardworking innovative professionals to our growing team

1282993 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
1282994 this new program has really helped our middle eastern gaming policy company
1282995 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly
1282996 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
1282997 with the recent boom in the middle eastern gaming policy market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
1282998 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
1282999 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
1283000 its important for all our top hires to know individuals within the industry and individuals within our company this makes marketing and sales work much easier and more efficient so if your uncle bob at a major middle eastern gaming policy firm offers you a job youre advised to take it
1283001 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in middle eastern gaming policy marketing on the internet
1283002 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium

1283140 i honestly dont think anyone could have done a better job than what hes done i have no doubt thats a main reason why were having success
1283141 hes an extraordinary athlete and my only way of trying to defeat him was to try to belt him but i couldnt catch him all that often
1283142 there were so many within the playing group that looked up to him and he needed to assure the rest of his teammates that the direction of the decision making that the team had undertaken was the right one for the club

1283191 in the 1930s and 1940 prisons were about rehabilitation yes there was a lot of racism yes there was a lot of brutality and yes a lot of people were killed by the guards but rehabilitation was also possible later in the century the idea evolved that prisoners were incorrigible that rehabilitation didnt work and that the best way to deal with prisoners was to lock them up and throw away the key as that evolved as the reigning ideology in the california prisons and the prisons around the country various self interested people joined the bandwagon along came the guards union along came politicians giving inflamed rhetorical speeches about how whats wrong with our society is not that weve messed up our education system its not that weve dismantled welfare its not that there are no jobs for poor people its that theres a bunch of criminals on the street and we should focus public attention on locking up criminals forever then there were the people who build prisons there was a huge prison building boom in the 1980s all of these people started making more money and gaining more power by causing prisoners to fail the longer a prisoner stays in prison or if he gets out the sooner he gets put back in the more money and more power these interested groups get this is the idea of the prison industrial complex that the prison isnt really there to rehabilitate the prisoner prison is there to make the reputation of a politician or increase the power or the money of these various interests
1283192 in my encounters with the work spread by justseeds i realized that arts role in political struggle could be bigger it has offered valuable commentary but by politicizing its production the costs the collaboration it could also show how to put the ideals we voice into creative practice i saw this in lots of small but important ways how it was made where it appeared how it got into peoples hands
1283193 networks and organization are not simply tools to be more efficient or successful but the building blocks of creating a new world our current society is structured to make us feel like atomized individuals alienated from others and ourselves this makes us more vulnerable to the massive amount of corporate and state propaganda we are bombarded with daily by building organizations and communities where we try to really connect understand and support each other we can build the collective tools necessary to both live our lives for personal self fulfillment as well as change the larger society so that all will be free to do the same
1283194 its been amazing to have so many people offer help and enlightening to realize how few places there are to get interesting intelligent and political art

1283196 all these contacts expand the reach of justseeds of course being a decentralized co op also allows each artist to focus more on the city region that they operate out of which has been great for developing new projects and for tabling local events we have also divided the tasks of running the co op so that the workload is shared

1283208 as banks and financial institutions seek to differentiate their online banking offerings we are seeing that web 2 0 technologies making a real impact on how these typically traditional organizations can do business said david lavenda the firms vice president of marketing and product strategy there is a greater pressure on banks to explore new business models that meet evolving customer demands and requirements and being able to use diverse tools such as personalized homepages social networks rss and gives financial services firms a significant advantage as long as they meet strict corporate security and governance requirements lavenda comments following the release of a new report from celent that concludes that a handful early movers are showing signs of moving customers to a web 2 0 centric environment and that this trend will accelerate considerably over the next 12 18 months banks and financial institutions are currently trying to prune the cost of customer support as well as enhance the level of promotion of new services to small business and corporate customers and web 2 0 technology is able to satisfy both these needs with much higher degrees of business interaction which increases the likelihood customers will do more business with their existing institution
1283209 celents report concludes quite rightly that whilst business banking online services provide a raft of services they look and feel out of date and are not what todays customers are really after in the web 2 0 driven e business world
1283210 banks have been holding back from embracing web 2 0 technology and its attendant advantages because of uncertainty on how to implement these solutions with enterprise grade security

1283250 the rudd government needs to get on their bike and get on with unit pricing
1283251 theyve had already seven months and if theyre going to deliver on lower grocery prices unit pricing has to come first
1283252 he mr rudd said he would do something about the price of petrol he hasnt
1283253 he said hed do something about the price of groceries the report doesnt do anything about it at all
1283254 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1283255 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1283256 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1283257 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1283258 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1283259 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices
1283260 woolworths is already working towards this with a trial in its baulkham hills store leading to a national rollout soon

1283275 wir m ssen mit demut entschlossenheit und starkem willen arbeiten um diese phase zu berwinden und unsere ziel zu erreichen
1283276 wir freuen uns sehr dass wir im wichtigsten event des s damerikanischen motorsports wieder unterst tzung von den wtcc piloten bekommen
1283277 2006 hat die zusammenarbeit zwischen den tc2000 und den wtcc piloten sehr gut funktioniert wir haben das rennen gewonnen im vergangenen jahr konnten die wtcc piloten wegen einer berschneidung im kalender nicht kommen deshalb freuen wir uns umso mehr dass es in diesem jahr wieder klappt der vorteil ist dass sowohl alain als auch rob die strecke das rennen und die tc2000 autos schon kennen
1283278 unn tig zu sagen dass ich in diesem jahr wieder ein so gutes ergebnis holen m chte

1283298 martin du hast bei mclaren schon fter erlebt wie junge fahrer ihren ersten grand prix gewonnen haben was bedeutet der sieg am sonntag f r heikki kovalainen
1283299 wir haben eine gro e finnische tradition im team und ich habe schon erlebt wie mika h kkinen und kimi r ikk nen bei mclaren ihren ersten grand prix gewonnen haben auch bei lewis hamilton anm d red
1283300 der erste sieg ist eine best tigung f r ihr k nnen und steht f r das woran mclaren mercedes bei seinen fahrern glaubt wir stellen sie an weil wir denken dass sie sieger sind sobald wir ihnen das material geben das daf r gut genug ist ist es nur eine frage der zeit bis sie zu gewinnen anfangen und das auch regelm ig heikkis sieg war voll gerechtfertigt und sehr verdient er hatte im ersten teil der saison eine menge pech aber der sieg in ungarn hat bewiesen dass er daran nicht zerbrochen ist er ist so entschlossen wie eh und je und er ist voll darauf fokussiert f r das team zu gewinnen
1283301 bei all unseren anderen fahrern haben wir erlebt dass sie nach dem ersten sieg mehr davon wollen niemand bei uns zweifelt daran dass heikki ein gro artiger rennfahrer ist dieses resultat wird seine ambitionen in der zweiten saisonh lfte nur st rken ich bin zuversichtlich dass heikki vor saisonende noch einen zweiten grand prix gewinnen wird wir wollen ihm jedenfalls das n tige material daf r zur verf gung stellen wir nehmen ferrari in der konstrukteurs wm ins visier und es kann nur gut f r uns sein dass unsere beiden fahrer pushen um den punkter ckstand zu verringern
1283302 felipe war in budapest eindeutig sehr stark speziell im ersten teil des rennens
1283303 warst du berrascht ber die starke pace von ferrari am sonntag und abgesehen vom reifenschaden welche probleme hatte lewis sonst noch
1283304 felipe massa anm d red war in budapest eindeutig sehr stark speziell im ersten teil des rennens wir wollen unbedingt herausfinden wo dieser pl tzliche leistungsanstieg herkam in wahrheit war lewis performance im ersten stint hinter felipe massa anm d red aber sehr respektabel bis zum ersten boxenstopp war er stets bis auf drei sekunden an ihm dran und wir machten uns wegen ferraris pace keine sorgen
1283305 im zweiten stint schien sich das blatt zu wenden wir stoppten sp ter als felipe betankten lewis entscheidend l nger als den ferrari und hatten einen performancevorteil trotz der schwereren benzinladung wir waren zuversichtlich dass lewis f r den letzten stint einen entscheidenden vorteil gehabt h tte aber leider zwang ihn ein reifenschaden dazu fast eine ganze runde dahinzurollen der reifenschaden trat in der ersten kurve auf und in der zweiten kurve war die luft raus
1283306 au erdem musste lewis dadurch fr her als geplant zum stopp kommen das hat nicht nur den benzinvorteil zunichte gemacht sondern er musste mit den superweichen reifen auch sorgf ltiger haushalten als urspr nglich geplant weil der letzte stint l nger war dass er das so m helos hinbekommen hat spricht f r seinen scharfen verstand platz f nf war unter diesen umst nden ein beeindruckendes resultat
1283307 welchen vorteil bringen eigentlich die dumbo fl gel auf der nase
1283308 man kann den vorteil denn ein einzelnes aerodynamisches teil f r die performance bringt nicht isolieren diese nasenwinglets zogen beim test in jerez und beim ungarn grand prix viel aufmerksamkeit auf sich aber die wahrheit ist dass sie mit dem ganzen auto harmonieren und so die performance verbessern es spricht nicht nur f r unsere design und windkanalteams dass wir in letzter zeit so viele neue komponenten einf hren konnten sondern auch f r unsere modellbau und produktionsabteilungen und unsere aggressive entwicklungsstrategie wird nicht verlangsamt so gewinnt oder verliert man die weltmeisterschaft wie wir auch fr her schon erlebt haben
1283309 man wird im freitagstraining beim n chsten rennen einiges sehen
1283310 welche weiterentwicklungen sind f r die sommerpause geplant und was werden wir in valencia am auto sehen
1283311 vor valencia f hren wir zwei 50 kilometer shakedowns durch wir entwickeln au erdem laufend neue teile f r das auto w hrend unsere simulations und entwicklungsabteilungen fortlaufend neue teile produzieren werden wir uns berlegen ob diese auch eingesetzt werden wir verraten nicht welche teile das sind aber man wird im freitagstraining beim n chsten rennen einiges sehen
1283312 einige teams haben in letzter zeit haifischflossen eingef hrt wie ist der stand der dinge bei euch
1283313 wir haben die haifischflosse vor dem deutschland grand prix beim test in hockenheim ausprobiert das ziel ist damit die sensibilit t des autos bei seitlich abweichender fahrt zu verbessern aber wir haben herausgefunden dass dadurch in einem anderen bereich nachteile entstehen wie man mit freiem auge sehen kann ist es eine gro e struktur sehr anf llig auf seitenwind wir hatten das gef hl dass unser auto bei schr ger fahrt bereits sehr gut ist und dass uns die haifischflosse keinen ausreichenden nutzen bringen w rde um einen einsatz zu rechtfertigen insofern hat das projekt im moment nicht priorit t
1283314 wie bereitet sich das team auf den europa grand prix in valencia vor
1283315 wir haben die konstruktion der neuen hafenstrecke in valencia genau verfolgt und sind berzeugt davon dass sie eine bereicherung f r den kalender ist eine absolut erstklassige anlage es gibt einige dinge die wir als team tun k nnen wenn wir an eine neue strecke kommen zum beispiel haben wir regelm ig leute nach valencia geschickt um daten hinsichtlich der streckenbeschaffenheit zu sammeln ebenso wie hinsichtlich der h he der randsteine und der auslaufzonen sodass wir uns ein klares bild von den anforderungen machen k nnen wir haben keinen stein auf dem anderen gelassen haben sogar onboardaufnahmen von der strecke studiert um berholm glichkeiten auszumachen
1283316 while we are trying to extinguish the fire here with our troops we dont understand very well that they chose that moment to put more oil on the fire by taking the decision
1283317 the first option is to leave that oil in the ground but the international community would have to compensate us for immense sacrifice that a poor country like ecuador would have to make
1283318 will the industrialized powers put their abundant money where their mouth is on climate change and biodiversity protection and actually buy back the environment they helped degrade
1283319 its better for our countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high
1283320 daniel did you miss me when you were in school today
1283321 huh i miss you so much daniel did you miss me
1283322 yea but just a little bit i have so many things to do in school
1283323 im a simple cheerful and friendly woman with great passion in writing
1283324 la cifra de paro es mala pero seguimos con el objetivo del pleno empleo
1283325 this is the premier organization for advancing excellence in cosmetic dentistry and i am excited to help lead the profession into the future
1283326 we are honored and thrilled to have a physician like dr gremillion who understands the role that masticatory health plays in overall health join the dawson academy
1283327 dentistry is the only medical specialty with full responsibility of the head and neck and thus the associated conditions that can develop in this region
1283328 dr gremillions extensive background in dentistry will allow us the opportunity to provide our students with a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of head neck orofacial pain and sleep disorders in patients
1283329 the true powers of the technologies that continue to impact dentistry can only be realized when integrated with a thorough foundation of sound clinical principles
1283330 the basis of our academys teachings is diagnosis today we have the most advanced methods for diagnosis and treatment in the history of dentistry and i believe it is more important than ever for dentists to be physicians of the entire masticatory system for this reason we are thrilled about the alliance with henry schein and their commitment to dental education
1283331 the new emerging dental technologies will change the way we diagnose communicate and deliver contemporary treatment to our patients together the dawson academy and henry schein have the abilities and resources needed to disseminate the necessary education to dental professionals worldwide
1283332 at henry schein we are committed to supporting our dental customers in every aspect of their practice
1283333 we strive to offer innovative new solutions to dentists and believe that the dawson schein educational initiative certainly meets those criteria the technology tools that are revolutionizing the practice of dentistry will only realize their full potential when dental team members have knowledge based on a solid clinical foundation by striking the right balance between state of the art technology and clinical application we are helping to ensure the health of dentistry for years to come
1283334 it was great to get a victory against my old side during the week
1283335 however what counts for us is if we can continue like that when the season begins
1283336 we are certainly raising the bar in our performances that is what we have got to do i have told the players that it is okay to raise the bar in these games but it is no good if we get off to a bad start in the ryman premier league
1283337 it is going to be different once the season begins sometimes we are going to have to go away from home and play a little less direct but at home we can get it down and play we had to do that last season and i am sure we will this campaign
1283338 margate was only our third game and its shown especially against them and faversham that other teams are much fitter than us much sharper faversham had played four games to our one
1283339 most of our players had only played a couple of 45 minutes but now a six or seven have got 90 minutes under their belt and you can see the improvement
1283340 well have to talk to the father some more to try to get to the bottom of this
1283341 he left austins three children in the burning house when he fled
1283342 hmm ive heard of this one place that serves possum testicles and nachos
1283343 but if i go to such a place it will add to my already noxious air of superiority because i eat adventurous foods while watching english premier soccer games im so european
1283344 it would be nice if we could put a performance in and get three points on the board its alright winning friendlies but its different when there are points at stake
1283345 its very important we get a good start at the end of the day we dont have a pre season like we have had to get off to a bad start we want to hit the ground running
1283346 i think the biggest difference this year is we have goals coming from all over the place which is what i want to see we have got some strong players for our level who could easily be playing higher up
1283347 we want a safety net because we do not want to take too many chances with crop biodiversity
1283348 can you imagine an effective efficient sustainable response to climate change water shortages food security issues without what is going to go in the vault it is the raw material of agriculture
1283349 we looked very far into the future we looked at radiation levels inside the mountain and we looked at the areas geological structure
1283350 we also modelled climate change in a drastic form 200 years into future which included the melting of ice sheets at the north and south poles and greenland to make sure that this site was above the resulting water level
1283351 one example happened in september when a typhoon ripped through the philippines and destroyed its seed bank
1283352 the storm brought two feet of water and mud into the bank and that is the last thing you want in a seed bank
1283353 somebody will go up there once every year to physically check inside to see that everything is ok but there will be no full time staff

1283360 a wonderful ambassador for her species it is significant that she has survived to 2008 the international year of the polar bear so designated by polar bears international which promotes the conservation of the species under threat by global warming
1283361 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1283362 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1283363 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1283364 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1283365 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1283366 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1283367 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1283368 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1283369 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1283370 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1283371 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1283372 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1283373 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1283374 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1283375 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1283376 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1283377 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1283378 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1283379 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1283380 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1283381 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1283382 who are open to doing something on the production side
1283383 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1283384 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1283385 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1283386 i have no idea what to do tonight in sl
1283387 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1283388 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1283389 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1283390 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1283391 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1283392 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1283393 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1283394 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1283429 are you attending to your vision are you stripping yourself in prayer before the terrible and searching word of god are you being refined in that fire and am i is my vision doing that to me breaking and remaking my thoughts and words my heart and mind i have no right to destroy your vision nor you mine i have no business to devalue your understanding or make light of your struggles nor you mine but we have the right and perhaps the duty to put the questions to each other and hear them from each other when all the formulae all the slogans all the impassioned sincere and no doubt inevitable theological disputation is over then we have to get back on our knees and ask about our own fidelity to gods questioning our own readiness to go into the desert when the security of pictures and ideas fade away where all theologies finally give way to god

1283431 sats have become little more than vanity testing proof for the government of rising standards in primary schools which the consumers of these results secondary schools arent buying
1283432 the underlying problem is that testing has become the end rather than the means in driving up school standards
1283433 the testing process has led to a scenario in which the outcome is much more important than how it is achieved as a result higher test scores have particularly over the last decade in synch with ambitious targets often represented less learning and worse educated pupils
1283434 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1283435 results have improved significantly since 1997 for both 11 and 14 year olds and those results are in turn reflected in higher gcse results evidence from inspections has shown that the quality of teaching has improved alongside improvements in test and examination results
1283436 a well rounded understanding of the subject is the best preparation to do well in any test teaching to the test is a term which is bandied about very freely to cover a broad range of possible practice in schools from recapitulating on core english and maths skills to repeated practice of test questions

1283440 ive seen a few xxx rated movies that should be x rated xx at most
1283441 they have these statistics that they bring up where its like well 78 of parents find the ratings very useful and i always feel its like because theyre the only game in town compared to nothing at all they probably are useful look parents there could be a real real ratings board where if you were unhappy with it there could be real transparency real accountability if people wouldnt like that more

1283448 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1283449 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1283450 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1283451 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1283452 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1283453 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1283454 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1283455 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1283456 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1283457 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1283458 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1283459 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1283460 wow thats incredibly shitty and stupid and i want my ink back
1283461 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1283462 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1283463 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1283464 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1283465 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1283466 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1283467 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1283468 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1283469 i am magnidine warrior of a hundred battles who single handedly defeated the dwarves on thier island and you dare say that your family is more important than me
1283470 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1283471 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1283472 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1283473 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1283474 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1283475 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1283476 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1283477 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1283478 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1283479 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1283480 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1283481 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1283482 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1283483 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1283484 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1283485 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1283486 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1283487 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1283488 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1283489 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1283490 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1283491 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1283492 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1283493 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1283494 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1283495 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1283496 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1283497 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

1283537 rafael da silva played the full 90 minutes and was pleasing and his brother fabio played 45 minutes as well
1283538 i was really pleased with their contributions and it will be interesting to see how they get on this season
1283539 the squad we had tonight will play juventus on wednesday with ryan giggs paul scholes and gary neville to come in

1283542 the size and quality in depth in the squad is the difference

1283545 certo ma noi siamo divisi eternamente come pu un amore che tra due sboccia vedere i propri destini separatamente lui di giorno e io di notte sempre da lontano ci ammiriamo bramando un abbraccio anche fugace come ogni innamorato desideriamo di stare assieme nullaltro e nel cuore non ho pace
1283546 c solo un modo in cui io e il mio sole possiamo baciarci e amarci ma sono volte pi uniche che rare sono le eclissi che ci fanno ritrovare e ricongiungere nella morsa dellamore

1283554 well it seems to me that the best relationships the ones that last are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship you know one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before like a switch has been flicked somewhere and the person who was just a friend is suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with
1283555 in your life you meet people some you never think about again some you wonder what happened to them there are some that you wonder if they ever think about you and then there are some you wish you never had to think about again but you do
1283556 throughout life people will make you mad disrespect you and treat you bad let god deal with the things they do cause hate in your heart will consume you too
1283557 a loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself to laugh with me but never at me to cry with me but never because of me to love life to love himself to love being loved such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart
1283558 even though weve changed and were all finding our own place in the world we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face well come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us nothing will ever change so much to the point where were not all still friends
1283559 the most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart
1283560 so many of our dreams at first seem impossible then they seem improbable and then when we summon the will they soon become inevitable

1283564 its magic its wonderful the bunnies are back the legend is re born ive had a lot of adventures in my life but this truly is the cherry on top of the cake this is as good as it gets
1283565 it is a dream come true the feeling is euphoric as we recreate the classic cachet in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation
1283566 pull the 2 strategically placed gold ribbons and she becomes nude
1283567 the rabbit logo has to be the most recognizable of any in the world this is our 1 million salute 30ft high and just over 2 stories on the 24th and 25th floors so it can be seen from the strip the i 15 and up to a mile away its an electronic led so we can have any color and any image we want on it we selected video from the early days of playboy for the inside screen to make it very special and unique we have resurrected the brand for the 21st century and i believe everybody will accept it and embrace it because the tv show has helped tremendously and a whole new generationhas become fascinated with the playboy image that christy has reborn in a new direction plus we have the most gorgeous girls in the world in their new roberto cavalli uniforms complete with trademark fluffy rabbit tails and ears as our playboy dealers and cocktail servers and when i gave him the tour of his very own sky villa he stopped took a moment and said this is a very special time for me he was in tears absolutely blown away by what he saw
1283568 to recreate the classic cache of the playboy clubs in the perfect town with the perfect partners for the next generation is a dream come true when people see these venues they will be blown away this is the coolest party in town i was the person who had the sad task of closing the very last club 20 years ago and now im the happiest person re opening a brand new one its a euphoric feeling today though we are very different from the past its very important to remember we are not a standalone nightclub here but an integrated entertainment experience with dancing in moon drinking and dining in nove and entertainment and gaming in the playboy club so people will experience the brand in 3 different kinds of ways its the next generation of what a nightclub should be no nightclubs were ever more successful than playboy clubs for the number of years they were open they had the best entertainment the coolest guests and the greatest food all those years ago today though its impossible to book entertainment in such small clubs so thats why gaming became the important element what weve all done here in vegas will now be duplicated in london macau where the brand can come back to life in the same multi dimensional way this is the perfect town with the perfect partners and a family tradition continues
1283569 it is everything we wanted we kept asking hef if he was happy with what hesaw he said it was even more than we had promised he had tears in his eyes saying he was blown away and he just kept on hugging us we wanted to deliver more than beyond his wildest imagination we wanted his validation and he said we did it this is the first time ever that gaming and lounging have been integrated we wanted luxury and exclusivity without snobbery and this just smells of money
1283570 we are very happy with the girls we found as dealers and servers to represent playboy vegas
1283571 i agree that las vegas has always been considered los angeless playground and in reality the playboy mansion has always been considered a playground for the well to do and the important people in la so i think this will be the same just a little further east
1283572 this is a very exciting and memorable weekend for all of us

1283598 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1283599 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1283600 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1283601 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1283602 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september

1283604 we have great confidence in iain and believe he will be a successful steward of our investment by leveraging neomedias expertise and technology to bring barcode scanning technology into the mainstream iain understands the importance of interoperability and standardization in enabling a global ecosystem more importantly he understands the path to revenue realization is predicated on disciplined product strategy and operational precision
1283605 obviously we are pleased by yorkvilles continued investment in our business they have been supportive partners in neomedias efforts to establish a business system the world can embrace the time is now for neomedia to leverage our strong intellectual property technology solutions and industry expertise to mobilize this mobile barcode ecosystem

1283656 dont make your bin an easy target for a malicious fire
1283657 too many times we have seen incidents where fires started in bins and rubbish have spread to homes threatening property and even lives
1283658 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1283659 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1283660 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1283661 its because we didnt over feast in the good times that we now have no famine in tougher times
1283662 you can see a definite pickup of impairments more of that will come through in the second half but it is difficult to know what impact that will have
1283663 at that time the market for this type of product was controlled by two companies letraset australia with their ademco brand and swift later kayell with seal brand
1283664 we felt there was an opportunity to provide better service and continuity of supply so we invested in a few pallets of csl products and the market responded by supporting us because we re invested in stock and could keep up with the demand
1283665 by 1982 we were converting and re packaging our own rolls of dry mounting and laminating materials usually on the floor of our lounge with a little help from our three year old son ben
1283666 i began traveling to victoria and nsw and establishing supply deals with the big professional laboratories such as townsend and nu lab
1283667 by then we could offer mounting and laminating solutions from a4 up to big posters maps and plan drawings
1283668 and business was booming in the eastern states so we set up our first warehouse in brookvale in 1989 the move in took less than half a day when we moved last year still in brookvale it took 3 weeks and over 50 tonnes of stock was shifted
1283669 we also purchased the brand and distribution for ademco from letraset and bedded down our national distribution with photoline and framerpix in qld framing amp graphic supplies in nsw perth pro sales in wa jayco in sa celmac in vic and stallards in tas later in 1991 csl ademco and seal all came together via merger and acquisition and ademco seal was born
1283670 in 1998 our son ben officially joined the company nearly twenty years after helping out as a three year old on the floor of our loungeroom in perth
1283671 by then ademco seal was just seal and had swallowed another competitor sallmetal ben oversaw the installation of a new converting machine in 2000 adding to our ability to meet customer orders quickly and from local stocks starleatons philosophy of re investing in stock and carrying what we sell was paying off handsomely so we were able to attract kodak encad to offer us distributorship of their wide format inkjet products in 2000 we started starleaton digital solutions this year and gary smith who i had first met at budde joined as a partner and the colourgate rip was added
1283672 ian burns who helped the company through its incorporation retired in 2002 so once again it was lea and me ben moved into a sales role and our daughter mel joined in a sales and administration role
1283673 in 2006 we moved into larger premises yet again and began warehouse upgrades in all branches again ensuring stock that we sell is available on hand
1283674 we added the neschen brand to take us into the solvent and uv digital printer markets up to 5 metres in width
1283675 so far this year we have added alcan composite materials to expand into rigid substrates for mounting and printing numerous new staff and we have begun the move to eco friendlier inks and substrates ready for the inevitable measuring of carbon footprints which our customers will be compelled to offer
1283676 30 years is a long time but it seems like a whirlwind ride of constant growth good people coming going and some staying for a long time customers old and new digital progress highs and occasional lows and always a focus on what comes next however the one constant is that there will always be a growing need for business to display and advertise its products in both interior and exterior venues and these images and signs need to be professionally produced and protected starleaton has been there all the way with the right products delivered on time at the right price you might say from start to not quite finished yet
1283677 our sales in south korea have stagnated recently personally i think it may serve as a factor to push the current ceo to step down by taking full responsibility for the disappointing performance
1283678 we might change pricing strategies on some of our key money pots servers and pcs
1283679 we are having difficulty to widen the gap with samsung and other local pc manufacturers our brand image was also hit by the recent irregular troubles in supplying electronic systems to state funded projects

1283686 he trained yesterday monday but that was only a light session so i stayed out afterward with matthew knights and we put him through a few drills and he came through that well and pulled up ok
1283687 he will train tomorrow and if he gets through and feels good about his body i cant see why he wont be right to return on the weekend for bendigo
1283688 hes had about 13 weeks out but his work off field has been brilliant to get himself right for this week
1283689 he was just about to come back about a month ago and re strained his calf but he has gotten on with it and his work ethic and work with the young guys has been excellent
1283690 we will play him in the midfield for about half the game playing in seven minute spurts because he will need plenty of rests
1283691 he will get 60 minutes this week and if gets through well we will take it up to 80 minutes next week predominantly in the midfield but also up forward so he can have a few shots on goal
1283692 if he gets through that and trains well you never know what can happen
1283693 he is a natural leader on the ground and his communication helps lift the side
1283694 i know jason is excited about playing and i suppose to have his body right is a relief

1283700 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
1283701 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1283702 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience

1283815 we are supporting local communities in maesteg providing reassurance to those who are understandably shocked by what has happened
1283816 she said it is kicking off there theyre all going over to batter someone the taxi dropped me off
1283817 the next thing i know i heard a woman saying hes not going to survive not going to survive
1283818 i looked through the window but couldnt see anything it was too dark
1283819 i heard a row with dogs and people fighting at about a quarter past two i didnt go out to look
1283820 they were friendly going down the street then they were arguing among themselves when they came back up it sounded like the same voices they were right under the window
1283821 i didnt hear any fighting but there were loud voices
1283822 i didnt know anybody had been killed until i stepped out of the door in the morning and saw the police tent
1283823 its normally a quiet area weve had nothing like this before its a nice little spot really
1283824 i havent heard of any fighting or anything up here usually this is a very quiet area
1283825 a t tu par une balle qui sest fich e dans son cou
1283826 le tueur a fait usage dune arme munie dun silencieux la r gion a t aussit t boucl e plusieurs personnes ont t interpell es parmi les occupants des chalets voisins de celui de m souleimane

1283829 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1283830 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1283831 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1283832 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1283833 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1283834 have a list of pet friendly hotels veterinary clinics and boarding facilities in or around the town your are evacuating to
1283835 a lot of animals that died during rita were cases of overheating because of power outages not because of the storm
1283836 cats are more attached to their territory than to their owner
1283837 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1283838 im delighted to be a part of the otago set up and am really looking forward to playing some good cricket for them next season
1283839 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1283840 ill stand out there in the rain storm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard
1283841 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1283842 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1283843 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1283844 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1283845 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1283846 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1283847 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1283848 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
1283849 my whole goal for him was hes got to show me golf is the most important thing in his life
1283850 and the most important thing in his life is getting drunk
1283851 i had rib surgery two months ago i just had a cyst in my right hand and they finally got that out now ive got tendinitis in my left elbow
1283852 the great players that play this game they make their breaks thats the little challenge for me to make a break it feels like when i do make a pitch its right out of reach of somebody
1283853 the only time youve got to prove something to somebody is when youre in the minor leagues trying to make it up there
1283854 probably should have maybe squeaked that one out of there
1283855 i hit an 0 and 2 curveball i really thought i got it in the corner i dont know if he had it shaded over there i thought i got it in the corner but he was there
1283856 were close friends off the field so im sure ill be hearing about that when we get together tonight
1283857 hes always got the best of me tonight i got him
1283858 he was pitching with such confidence his body language he was working quicker he was coming off the mound with some aggression
1283859 but we got into that bind in that one inning there were a lot of baserunners and he was trying to be perfect just need to limit the damage hes growing
1283860 we talked about when he came back that its still a work in progress and we acknowledged that but i do like the way he went back out and handled himself and stayed out and pitched because thats the kid we think can really compete in this league
1283861 need to make a pitch get a ground ball and just the ground ball tonight was hit 150 miles an hour at jed
1283862 cant fault anybody for that it feels like its an inch away
1283863 i decided to leave several months ago largely because i had my own startup idea which didnt really fit with shiny
1283864 i had also been involved with the company in its various guises for five years four of which at the helm so that seemed long enough i have other things on the go i am working on a startup in the online video arena am doing some consultancy mainly for sister pr agency shiny red and have spare time to work with some other startups i am still a significant shareholder in the company and on the board
1283865 lack of a content friendly vc ecosystem fierce opposition from existing media and the huge online presence of the bbc
1283866 paul inces big time experience and galvanising qualities are what rovers will seek to harness as they look to push on this season
1283867 ince isnt the type to be cowed by a challenge
1283868 you must tell them what you saw you must tell them how we were executed
1283869 we dont want people hanging out in the first row intoxicated they put ourselves in danger and that puts our guys in danger
1283870 ms mbeki will be joining a number of heads of state and government who will be representing their countries and thus leading their respective national teams to the worlds most beautiful spectacle the olympic games
1283871 since the womens marathon race at the games will be run on august 17 she will only fly back to harare on august 12 before leaving for beijing the following day
1283872 given the successful launch of this tournament last friday i believe that we are heading for an exciting period and we want to leave a mark in which people will forever remember the inaugural edition of this tournament
1283873 we have big plans for the competition and we want the clubs the players and the fans to feel that it was all worth it by the time that we celebrate with the winning team
1283874 we have huge incentives for the players to try and provide the boost that will inspire them to scale the heights and provide quality entertaining football for the fans
1283875 we want to leave great memories in which at the end of the season the fans the players and the media will remember a superb tournament
1283876 what we are saying is that the less fortunate members of our society who cannot come to watch the games because of one reason or another cannot be forgotten while we party at the stadiums
1283877 thereforre we have decided that 10 percent of net gate takings from all matches in the abc sup8r showdown will be channeled to charity
1283878 each club shall be paired to a charitable organisation from its hometown
1283879 i think our approach and attitude in the early stages of the game was a bit casual when we started the game some of our players were still at the hotel
1283880 at this level you have to start playing from the first minute of the game and that is why we conceded that stupid early goal from a corner
1283881 after that we started to play well but we still had problems in midfield especially in attack our two strikers benjamin marere and edward sadomba fought a lone battle
1283882 the two teams played the same formation 3 5 2 and i think we need to quickly learn to man mark our opponents in such kind of situations
1283883 we also gave away possession early in the first half which i think was due to some stage fright because the egyptians were very vociferous and we need to get used to that
1283884 but each time we played a simple passing game we did well and caused problems for them
1283885 i think wonder is not yet fully fit from what i know of him he is very mobile and very creative on the edge of the box but i think we saw 50 percent of him and we were also unlucky to see murape injured because he had been supporting the attack well
1283886 there is no point in playing the long ball with a team that has three tall central defenders so our midfield needs to learn to look for the ball
1283887 yesterday we needed to use our wingbacks as we normally do if we played wide it would have been easier to get to the final third faster
1283888 sometimes you learn through the hard way and last night sunday night we learnt the hard way that at this level you do not get clear chances so we must use the half chances that we get but i thought we improved a lot in the second half especially when danisa phiri and phillip marufu came on
1283889 we have two weeks to work on the next assignment and we really needed to step up on our preparations as the competition is getting tougher i think there are things that we can work on easily
1283890 defensively we were not bad but the area of concern is midfield i think with the experience that desmond has we really missed him and i just hope he would be ready by the time we go for the next game
1283891 they came out fighting they were full of running from the defence through to their attack and their players are good at running off the ball
1283892 i was impressed with that but i cannot complain much about this defeat
1283893 we have not played in this tournament for nearly 10 years and most of the youngsters we have save for murape and desmond are only playing at this level of the competition for the first time so we will keep trying our best
1283894 every team still has a chance even asec we started off very slowly we lacked in concentration but we gradually improved
1283895 zamalek are also a very good side and it is always difficult to play against such an experienced team but we were also unlucky not to get at least an equaliser
1283896 femme lunettes femme lunettes femme lunettes femme lunettes toujours coquettes lalallaaalalaaaa
1283897 bryan aldave is definitely not a bad player sundowns would not have signed him if he was a bad player he did very well when given a chance last season unfortunately he had to make space for another foreign player
1283898 we have signed two new local strikers sibusiso zuma and katlego mphela and we are also looking at bringing in another foreigner to the club
1283899 this is a decision that was made by the coach and i just have to respect it it is time to start looking forward because i still have to continue with my career elsewhere i did my part in contributing towards the teams promotion
1283900 as a professional player you have to be strong under these circumstances this will only build me as a player and make me stronger for the future i really wanted to stay and compete for a place in the psl but this is not a train smash
1283901 everyone who is part of the team is obviously excited for the good start the morale is high and we hope the good start will see us through a successful season
1283902 youfra is a very strong team with a good number of experienced players they gave us a lot of hard time despite winning against them
1283903 after that disappointment in tanzania the only way to erase those memories was to win and indeed it happened
1283904 one game cannot determine what the future holds for us in the league but we just have to maintain the standards we set in order to achieve it all
1283905 kakira knows our style of play because we are from the same region
1283906 it is not the team we wanted to play in our first game because they have always given us a good challenge but good enough we beat them
1283907 it took zimbabwean boxer livingstone kachigwada just two rounds and it took him just two minutes in round two to wrap up his much anticipated fight against namibias shileka
1283908 the namibian appeared totally unprepared for the cat footed and unbeaten zimbabwean boxer who had an easy pay day without having to shed a drop of sweat after sending his clearly out of sorts opponent down with a dangerous combination of punches
1283909 shileka went into the fight with much hype slightly supported by his record of 11 wins and three losses in the paid ranks before saturdays humiliating defeat at the hands of kachigwada
1283910 the odds were heavily against kachigwada from the moment he was invited to fight in namibia but we are happy that he has come out with a crucial win
1283911 its quite an achievement and a very historic feat for him to beat such a calibre of boxer like the namibian champion he faced
1283912 it took him three days to travel to namibia and this is something that is totally unacceptable in professional boxing
1283913 that was a very poor arrangement by the promoters in namibia and it meant all the effort done at training was going to go down the drain overnight because of the hectic travelling
1283914 this fight also came at short notice and the boxer was ring rusty having last fought more than 12 months ago
1283915 is he aware that he is taking products that have been developed by the stables who invested a lot in the boxers all he does now is reap by acting as the match maker manager promoter and taking the 10 percent levies
1283916 i do no want to say a lot at this point because we are still to meet the boxing board and talk over the matter
1283917 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1283918 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1283919 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1283920 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1283921 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1283922 we are not performing well at all and our current position on the league table is very far from pleasing but i still want to believe that we can re launch our campaign and survive
1283923 unfortunately we did not do much to reinforce our squad during the mid season transfer window apart from bringing back lloyd hlahla
1283924 we are feeling the void created by ovidy karurus departure and for instance in our last match against lengthens we failed to create any scoring chance something ovidy would do
1283925 that has left us depleted and if you look at where we are in the league it is very worrying considering that we have been fighting for the league over the past three seasons
1283926 our home form has not been good also because we have already lost three games at mucheke while last season we lost just one game against hwange the whole season
1283927 that is very discouraging but like ive said i believe we will turn the tables and survive relegation
1283928 here mutare it doesnt matter whether you are a big team or small team we are beating them all because our policy now is that
1283929 we have seven more matches at home and that should give us 41 points and i think that will be good enough to keep us in the league
1283930 we will not be settling for draws in the remaining home matches and we also hope to get at least a point from away matches against highlanders and dynamos
1283931 im the boss im overall in charge and im the one answerable for the eastern lions results in my position as technical director
1283932 i am actually in the position to hire and fire coaches if im not happy with the results i know there has been some confusion but people must remember that i started with this team when they were facing relegation to division two three years ago
1283933 due to my commitments with the national team i felt i needed someone to be in charge when im away with the warriors like recently when we had matches for a good one month
1283934 it would have been unfair for me to spend a month away from eastern lions and then expecting them to fulfill matches and that is why we made the changes but otherwise everyone here knows who is in charge of what
1283935 i felt we needed a couple of seasoned players to help the youngsters
1283936 i wouldnt say the wheels are coming off despite failing to win in the last four games
1283937 the only problem is that we havent been scoring that many goals and that is why weve brought in more moyo i think that with him around things will improve
1283938 we have been using elliot matsika as a striker when he is not really a striker and now he will be playing his familiar role more
1283939 elliot was having a brilliant game but after that penalty miss his confidence dropped and i thought we needed to bring in someone fresh with pace also to try and stretch the monos defence
1283940 yeah and we are and we will be to create great experiences takes time and e3 is a point in time
1283941 youve seen some of the things we have in development but not all of them
1283942 we have not spoken to williamson at any level we have interviewed two coaches but williamson is not one of them
1283943 this time we have to be sure and get the right coach for the team we shall take our time but certainly this week there is no announcement regarding the appointment of the coach
1283944 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1283945 everyone will tell them how deficient it is and then something else will happen
1283946 the americans have produced material which they say they have had no chance to give though they gave it to the acc and they gave it to the primates all the time different things are being presented to different groups and so not everyone is in the loop
1283947 the assumption is that polity is made by bishops some of us live in churches that believe in synodical government we can influence but not control
1283948 when people stood up and said well my brother americans i disagree fundamentally and theologically with you but i will not leave the anglican communion that for me kept up the spirit of indaba
1283949 in indaba we do not write each other off we say i may disagree with you but lets keep on defining what our position is and through that we will finally come to an agreement
1283950 my sense is that even if we are not articulating it as such even if sometimes we are clumsy at that the fact that we have stayed right through and engaged one another is a positive thing
1283951 well be looking for the lambeth conference to work out these proposals in more detail we need to have the windsor continuation group give a bit of a steer so they can show the way the communion should be moving
1283952 my sense is it would bring people together face to face to talk about these things i think that will be a tremendous step forward so were not sending communiqu s across the ocean so we dont really talk about things in person
1283953 we need restraint patience and forbearance forbearance is one of my favourite biblical words
1283954 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1283955 traditionally wool was the major income for russian sheep farmers using the fine wool short tailed breeds however now wool is no longer profitable and the nation needs feeding we need to develop a meat breed of sheep
1283956 we want to improve our breeding and get the right carcass by introducing some suffolk texel and charollais into the flock however at the moment we need a certificate from the russian agricultural vet service to use these breeds
1283957 since we introduced the stabiliser as a dam line to our suckler herd we are finding that it is ticking all the right boxes in terms of improved performance and reducing input costs in particular feed and labour
1283958 for example last season we put f1 heifers to the stabiliser bull and they averaged two years at calving at which stage they hadnt received any form of concentrate there was no real issue at calving and the calves weighed less than 40kg
1283959 we cant believe it ourselves thats a tonne an acre more than i ever could have hoped
1283960 rape has always been a disappointment this year it was completely the opposite
1283961 the crops looked superb all the way through and we were hoping to achieve 5t ha 2t acre

1283967 if you look at the month on month change this would be a more modest increase in the annual inflation rate compared with the big jumps in previous months
1283968 the expectation of further weakness in oil prices is keeping buying interest alive in spite of a 12 2 percent inflation rate in july
1283969 already we are seeing parts of our cash operating expenses rising and third quarter demand softening slightly albeit the third quarter being a seasonally low period
1283970 we remain cautious and vigilant yet confident still that we will achieve our targets for 2008
1283971 in any event there is no more debate on constitutionality because the japanese foreign minister has authorized the japan ambassador here to enter into an exchange of notes presumably with secretary alberto romulo of dfa department of foreign affairs so that all constitutional provisions in our philippine constitution that conflict with jpepa will be deemed to be dominant or superior to any jpepa provision
1283972 and since the constitutional provisions over which i was very adamant for the past year have already been accepted by japan i have no more problem with it as a constitutional law scholar
1283973 in any event now we will no longer have to debate it so my hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote two thirds of 23 should be about 15 or 16
1283974 well it is edging toward ratification and i hope i will be able to convince them tomorrow because we lose a lot in terms of economic benefits if we do not concur
1283975 monetary policy will continue to be appropriately tight until we see a more benign outlook and manageable inflation expectations
1283976 as expected inflation in july recorded another increase following the additional shock of typhoon frank on food commodities this was most pronounced in areas outside metro manila
1283977 with regards to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved
1283978 however there has been considerable damage done to us and in my part of the world what was somebody elses problem has become ours this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing was elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary this turned into our problem when it shouldnt have been
1283979 however the other day i was asked would i apologize and i said i would not apologize as the ioc does run the internet in china
1283980 there will be though a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over
1283981 the uncertainties have been resolved but there has been a lack of clarity from our point of view and i take responsibility for that
1283982 obviously some sites would not have been suitable such as pornographic subversive or those acting against the national interests
1283983 but there were some valid ones who were also barred but that has been cleared up and all is calm now for the moment
1283984 with the program for extending free legal assistance to our policemen with the support of the aida sy foundation and the aquila legis fraternity our cops will have the guarantee that they can continue enforcing the laws without fear and favor
1283985 they will be entitled to legal advice as well as representation in court as long as the policemen are facing charges as a result of the performance of their duties
1283986 the bad ones in the police force we will not help instead we will dismiss them
1283987 initial resolution presented by camarines sur representative luis villafuerte on tuesday during the hearing of the committee on energy which pampanga representative juan miguel arroyo heads
1283988 now therefore for and in consideration of the foregoing premises as an initial resolution of the aforesaid hearings the committee on energy has agreed that the practice of electric power companies of passing on to these consumers the electricity which said companies consumed for their own use as systems losses is illegal and therefore should be stopped
1283989 number 2 that the practice of electric power companies of charging more than 9 5 percent as systems losses to residential and commercial consumers is likewise contrary to law and should therefore also be discontinued
1283990 this resolution is not addressed to meralco only this is addressed to all public utilities so that if the principle is applied to meralco it should apply equally to all the others
1283991 we have stopped selling grand theft auto gta and inform all legal vendors to withdraw the game from their shelves
1283992 the company will not import gta 4 the next in the series to distribute in thailand
1283993 mayor has all the money blood money of the people
1283994 referred to the unexplained wealth which romualdez accumulated during the martial law years for which reason cases were filed against him by pcgg presidential commission on good government
1283995 we had great training in thailand with some quality partners and we are ready to go
1283996 there is great spirit in the team and we are all right behind each other
1283997 the olympics is 28 of the best boxers in the world so it is a massive step up our preparation has been great and i am giving myself a really good chance
1283998 i came here because in the 1970s i read this one little book that completely changed everything for me when i heard the news yesterday it was a terrible blow for me
1283999 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1284000 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1284001 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1284002 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1284003 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1284004 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1284005 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1284006 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1284007 it came out in our initial investigation that cuesta has been asked by one of the parties involved in the case to stop his harsh commentaries we are focusing on this angle kasi ito lang yong pinakamalaking issue na meron siyang nakabangga na malaking tao this is the biggest issue in which he came up against a prominent person
1284008 but maybe the issuance of mr and mo was still under process as cuesta was not carrying a firearm when shot at by two unidentified suspects
1284009 we could not be intimidated by such cowardly act of trying to eliminate our colleagues in the media profession we remain firm in pursuing our quest for justice and fairness even if this would cost our lives
1284010 as cuesta fights for his life this attack is a chilling reminder of the culture of impunity for those who would attack the philippines media
1284011 the philippines authorities must fulfill their responsibility to protect each and every person from such violence the fact that journalists continue to be targeted is a clear indication that the authorities actions or lack of actions are not delivering the message of zero tolerance
1284012 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services
1284013 people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1284014 nothing speaks louder of the governments poor faith than the fact that there are more long standing political prisoners in myanmar now than at any other time since those protests
1284015 the un should no longer accept the governments hollow assurances but hold myanmar firmly to its word
1284016 evaluate the skills and attitudes of everyone in the organization who is a candidate for a leadership position everyone yes because the ceo isnt the only position that requires succession planning
1284017 it has become more rather than less important over recent decades to be in london or new york if you want to participate
1284018 alliance boots is committed to working with suppliers for mutual long term benefit and believes that the groups procurement strategies are in line with other groups of similar size and scale
1284019 but if i met someone who used an iphone for business purposes who didnt have a really good excuse or wasnt a complete tech geek im not sure how seriously i could take them
1284020 with regards to pensions people should save up during their life time for their own pension not rely on the younger generation to pay for their pension
1284021 and mandates the use of its guidelines and domain name as part of the entry criterion
1284022 when hosting industry awards one of the most important aspects is to ensure they are open inclusive transparent fair and above all independent
1284023 by independent i mean free from influence by outside contributors such as sponsors and media partners naturally headline sponsors should have a say in a number of areas but its important to restrict their influence
1284024 i need to play with the team they are all expecting that i get back to my old role and they are helping me by passing me the ball

1284071 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the us helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1284072 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1284073 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the us economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1284074 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1284075 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1284076 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1gb of dram has declined by 43 during the past year while the price of 2gb of nand flash has declined by 61 in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150

1284086 opponents of relationship recognition for same sex couples often say that we have to protect children or that same sex relationships are against god
1284087 but this study suggests that lesbians and gay men who seek relationship recognition may be acting to protect their children and enact their own religious beliefs
1284088 faith communities may be important sources of legal education and advocacy for same sex couples
1284089 couples may be using commitment rituals to build cohesion within stepfamilies as the role of gay and lesbian stepparents is often vague such ceremonies may help couples validate their sense of belonging and obligation to each other while also demonstrating to friends and relatives that they are a family unit
1284090 its interesting that couples were motivated to have a commitment ceremony when their children were at this developmental stage just starting their own romantic explorations there may be an element of parenting going on here with couples wanting to give their children an example of commitment by formalising their own its an interesting question for future research
1284091 this study is an important contribution because it separates the legal and ritualistic aspects of solidifying a relationship not all same sex couples want legal protection or ritual recognition however those who do appear to take these steps for the same reasons straight people often do parenthood and religious commitment

1284122 he said when the tiger started biting me i kept punching it in the head
1284123 the law may allow them to operate but at some point we have to take initiative to regulate them beyond what the state of missouri does
1284124 now the thought has to be any time a cat wants to hop the fence and get to you he can
1284125 if theyre going to operate that kind of facility they have a moral and ethical responsibility to the citizens to be honest
1284126 we had received a number of complaints about this facility
1284127 i would have to agree that some of the fun out of going to the pool is gone
1284128 but it all comes down to safety society as a whole isnt as tolerant when it comes to the injury of a child and so we have to take any possibility of a mishap out of the equation
1284129 we clean those slides and wax them like crazy i cant see how you could damage them
1284130 and jumping well as far as im concerned you can jump until the cows come home we want people to come here and have fun all of those rules seem a bit stuffy to me

1284158 weve had a few emails back and forth since the book came out i think robert blames me for reigniting the media hunt for him
1284159 the book was never about finding him though i just dont think he realises even now what a profound effect his career and achievements had on people especially of our sort of age and generation he was a hero and it was as much about celebrating that as it was about understanding what made him tick
1284160 david millar reviewed the book in a newspaper and hit the nail on the head robert millar professed not to care what people thought of him but i think he actually cared immensely one of the criticisms i got from him after the book came out was the story about him being tight with his money he didnt like that there was the story about him dodging paying the road tolls that came from three or four independent sources so i felt like it merited inclusion
1284161 hed been lying about his whereabouts they sent him to manchester velodrome
1284162 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

1284171 i played the best summer hard season in my life so im very happy for that
1284172 in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him finally he beat me i just congratulate him because hes playing well
1284173 day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
1284174 rafa always gives 100 percent in every match and on any surface it was a challenge and i accepted it

1284178 io non sono il vincitore della maratona invece come dicono gli inglesi io sono colui che ha vinto ed ha perso la vittoria
1284179 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1284180 yeah mine is doing that too would you post the other emails so i can see them
1284181 that is what truly made my new york experience so amazing
1284182 i love the water and yet find it so interesting that in a city like new york surrounded by water we often forget that it is here
1284183 the hyperpresident is putting the public sector under his direct control
1284184 those who say the promotion of laurence ferrari is proof of the influence of nicolas sarkozy on tf1 were saying not very long ago that patrick poivre darvor was a sell out to the elysee palace
1284185 when youre a guest the least you can expect is for people to say hello
1284186 i think there may be a sense that peoples opinions have been heard
1284187 as to the reaction i think it depends on what the minister decides
1284188 i think its important that a certain process has been undertaken but well really only know if the process was valuable once we have the decision
1284189 there was little opportunity for debate and a decision was made in about two weeks one week of which was the march break school vacation
1284190 our objective should be to stop this virus and the best way to do so is with a vaccine
1284191 we need to get away from this home run mentality to research science is incremental
1284192 vaccine research is no longer a mom and pop shop it requires international consortia and a global strategic plan
1284193 microbicide development is a series of barriers no pun intended
1284194 we need a microbicide that is not coitally dependent we need to get protection away from the sex act like weve done with oral contraception for women
1284195 women are disproportionately infected with hiv thats because women still have to ask permission to protect themselves against hiv
1284196 i want to feel you cum deep inside of me
1284197 i cannot confirm the person who lives here is the suspect
1284198 shes just a sweetheart a kind hearted frail little old lady
1284199 she knew all along he was a registered sex offender but she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt that people could change and gave him a second chance
1284200 as a result of the altercation the suspect had to be transported to the local hospital
1284201 im going to get as many people together and as many government agencies as i can because this is blatantly unconstitutional
1284202 they stepped in the la brea tar pits and theyre not going to get out
1284203 if true the diocese of belleville was a willing participant in the culture of shielding a predator priest and ignoring victims complaints
1284204 this resulted in more innocent children being victimized and experiencing the pain anger and confusion of being sexually molested by a person of trust who was thought to represent christ
1284205 the way it will impact illinois is you wont see additional trains taking you to the baseball game for example
1284206 one of the things the referendum will do is make that problem go away
1284207 there will be money to operate the system as it exists now
1284208 it has a potential of affecting us because theres a fairly significant commute between folks who live in illinois and work in missouri
1284209 those are all big questions at this point with no answers
1284210 at a time when we need transportation options almost more than any other
1284211 it makes very little public policy sense to reduce transit service
1284212 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1284213 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1284214 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1284215 both occupants had some injuries to what extent i do not know
1284216 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1284217 so gramps did i tell you bout the movie i made of sis last week
1284218 i had her all naked and this old dude kept trying to get her to suck his cock but the little tramp was being all uptight finally got her to suck his cock but fuck me gramps the little slut started liking it
1284219 took all of his cock huge cock clean up in her wet little pussy she did kept bawling like a heffer birthin her first calf kept begging for more fuckin slut
1284220 im the guy whos almost impossible to piss off unless you mess with my friends or family
1284221 im the guy when everything goes wrong i make it right
1284222 im the guy that when i feel like it ill paint myself up like a clown even if its not halloween and go out in public in broad daylight just cause i wanna freak people out
1284223 im 22 but dont let my age fool you ive lived quite the life so far and still going strong
1284224 ive already travelled most of canada by myself just got the east coast left
1284225 i dont stress out too easily i like to listen to music whenever i can and would like to learn how to play the bass
1284226 if there are kids around im the guy who spends all day playing and spoiling them rotten
1284227 im the guy who brings everyone together to spend a day at the park
1284228 i keep in good shape cause i work my ass off and honestly i just hate fat
1284229 i also plan on starting my own business in the next year or so mainly because i wanna be my own boss
1284230 and hey it beats taking the bus cause its small and i save a lot on gas
1284231 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1284232 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it any more
1284233 the plan was okay but finally some climbers did not take their responsibility and then accidents like this happen very easy
1284234 right there at the top right at the top if not the top
1284235 weve tried pitching guys a little bit differently and obviously thats a credit to rod i think that makes difference guys get used to you pitching the same way and you mix things up and do some different things it sometimes goes that way
1284236 but its not something ive ever focused on i think you just try and get ahead and you have a couple of pitches try to put em away and try to do that but its definitely not something im trying to do you try not to get too giddy with it
1284237 i want to pitch to win and give our team a chance to win thats the most important thing after that theres not a whole lot thats high on my priority list
1284238 i am not responsible for my photographs photography is not documentary but intuition a poetic experience you cant go looking for it you cant want it or you wont get it first you must lose yourself then it happens
1284239 obviously as it is a concern to countries in the region as well as a concern to us
1284240 terrorism is a threat to the people of the region to the people of nations like pakistan but also a threat to the wider world
1284241 we all need to understand that situation we all need to do all that we can to correct whoever was involved in that bombing but the only way we are ever going to get a hold of this problem is through cooperation of the nations of the region and through cooperation with the nations of the region
1284242 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1284243 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1284244 considering the current hardships of the forest industry the fund is assessing different ways to compensate the impacts of this situation
1284245 been a fairly important issue over the last year or so
1284246 there is a potential for doubts that the contract will be extended
1284247 is there really any truth to the rumors that where you place those google adsense ads can actually improve response
1284248 i have no regrets and gave it all i could
1284249 the final decision was out of my hands im disappointed i would have liked the opportunity to have proven myself but felt i played well enough its a big business and theres lots of transactions going on
1284250 but my heads not in the nfl anymore im excited to play and im dying to get on the field and tackle maybe this week
1284251 they have great guys at free safety if i want to start i have to learn the system and playbook along with earning the coaches trust im not assuming anything
1284252 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1284253 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1284254 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1284255 as it turns out big oils most successful speculating wasnt in the oil fields it was in washington where they invested millions in john mccain and got their moneys worth
1284256 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1284257 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1284258 huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama
1284259 loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1284300 well i discovered that i could talk when i was pretty young
1284301 i wanted to help the government so i told the cia about my gift and in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping
1284302 i was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running
1284303 but the jetting around really tired me out and i knew i wasnt getting any younger so i decided to settle down i signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security wandering near suspicious characters and listening in
1284304 i uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals i got married had a mess of puppies and now im just retired
1284305 ten dollars this dog is amazing why on earth are you selling him so cheap

1284308 can you help me understand why you keep asking me if i am pregnant
1284309 i am sure that you dont intend to make me feel this uncomfortable

1284322 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1284323 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1284324 location information collected by cell phone companies can provide an extraordinarily invasive glimpse into the private lives of cell phone users courts have the right under statute and the duty under the fourth amendment to demand that the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before seizing such sensitive information
1284325 this is only the latest of many cases where eff has been invited to brief judges considering secret surveillance requests that arent supported by probable cause we hope this court recognizes the serious fourth amendment questions that are raised by warrantless access to cell phone location information and affirms the magistrates denial of the governments surveillance request

1284407 but i must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and i will give you a complete account of the system and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth the master builder of human happiness no one rejects dislikes or avoids pleasure itself because it is pleasure but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself because it is pain but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure to take a trivial example which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it but who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure

1284460 its quite likely that this effect is going to hit sweden then lending will slow down
1284461 weve had extremely high consumption for awhile and it might be hard to adjust to new times
1284462 in 1883 the iowa agricultural report stated that the us had 6 million miles of wood fence at a most conservative cost of 325 per mile
1284463 the rail fence not only lavished from 4 to 6 rails per section but was also insatiable in its demand for good wood as second growth soft wood lasts only 4 years or so the farmer who chose to build for the future used only virgin timber for his fences a complete acre of old growth forest went into the fences for each 10 acres of farmland a modest 200 acre farm would thereby require 20 acres of top grade locust or cedar to enclose it it has actually been shown in many cases that the westward migration of southern farmers was not entirely due to the reported exhaustion of the soil as most history books claim but also because of an exhaustion of fence material in an age of wire fencing such a statement seems absurd but if you depended on rail fence to surround your property at todays cost of 60 per hundred feet your 50 acre farm fence would cost close to 9 000 in 1875 it would have cost 1 000 or more than the worth of the farm

1284504 black brutes are depicted as hideous terrifying predators who target helpless victims especially white women
1284505 the terrible crime most often mentioned in connection with the black brute was rape more specifically the rape of a white woman at the beginning of the twentieth century much of the virulent anti black propaganda that found its way into scientific journals local newspapers and best selling novels focused on the stereotype of the black rapist the claim that black brutes were in epidemic numbers raping white women became the public rationalization for the lynching of blacks
1284506 in 1900 charles carrolls the negro a beast claimed that blacks were more akin to apes than to human beings and said that mulatto brutes were the rapists and murderers of his time

1284508 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
1284509 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1284510 now from the hapless but increasingly venomous mccain campaign comes the slimy britney spears and paris hilton ad the two highly sexualized women both notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear are shown briefly and incongruously at the beginning of a commercial critical of mr obama

1284538 the suleyman assasination is related to the attack on the syrian nuclear plant which was part of a joint syrian iran program to strengthen their military capabilities and strategic relationship
1284539 however a syrian source speaking by phone to asharq from london rules this out saying
1284540 to the best of my knowledge we didnt do it
1284541 look its outside the rules of course assassinations take place but to hit a general in his own country is close to an act of war and we just dont want a war with syria we are busy talking to them
1284542 an iranian spy might be killed in lebanon a hezbollah guy in syria but not a syrian in syria with a sniper the sniper might miss he might get caught there would have to be retaliation and neither side wants to get caught up in that game

1284545 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1284546 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us

1284548 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless

1284556 i was deeply disappointed to hear that the hunger strike memorial was damaged by vandals who removed the lark and who also stole the irish tricolour
1284557 this vandalism is the latest in a line of vandalism in the greater bogside area and people need to get respect for this area and stop this anti community activity
1284558 people have respected the memorial to the point that photographs of individuals hunger strikers set beside it are never removed or damaged
1284559 the hunger strikers gained the respect not only of the republican community but other communities world wide for their brave stance
1284560 indeed i have met unionists and loyalists who although didnt support them admired their courage
1284561 whatever the motive of the people involved in this destruction i would appeal to them to respect this memorial as much as i would appeal to everyone to show respect to other memorials no matter what political differences exist
1284562 i would appeal to people to refrain in this wanton damage and also appeal on the local community to be vigilant so that any further damage is avoided
1284563 belfast has become more cost effective for students relative to other major uk student cities compared with exeter for example students who choose belfast could theoretically be 2 016 better off over the course of one academic year
1284564 our concern is that if the current situation is left unchecked in 25 years time we could be talking about european and irish hares rather than grey and red squirrels
1284565 its the tallest building in belfast so its going to have to be the tallest crane
1284566 once you start looking at it your neck goes a bit stiff
1284567 the guys on the site said they had a sore neck looking up at it you have to stand away to see it
1284568 we would really be getting started this week after the holidays are over
1284569 were starting the superstructure from the ground up and the erection of the crane was the commencement of that
1284570 we should see more operatives on the site from this week on to make progress on the tower
1284571 ulster scots has a key role to play in the promotion of cultural diversity in northern ireland
1284572 londonderry has a wealth of history and strong connections with the ulster scots heritage and i believe that developing the citys culture will help maintain its position as one of the most popular visitor destinations in northern ireland
1284573 the colour and vibrancy of the foyle ulster scots festival is a great attraction for visitors and local people and helps their appreciation and understanding of the language literature music and dance of the ulster scots tradition
1284574 its always sad when something like this happens but when you go out to make these climbs its always in the back of your head
1284575 but once you do start climbing and going towards the goal it becomes all encompassing and thats what you think about
1284576 its a tragedy for the family and i feel for them because gerard was a lovely fella and a brilliant climber he was a very loyal friend and somebody that taught me a lot about climbing as well
1284577 he loved life adored life ill always remember his zest for life and joy of climbing
1284578 theres a bit of a bottleneck when you come off the summit
1284579 there had been a number of climbers congregated together there was a big slab at the side of the mountain that collapsed and swept them all away
1284580 when he was up a couple of years ago unfortunately he got hit by a rock about 600 metres from the summit and had a fractured skull and was airlifted out
1284581 he was prepared for that and worked really hard he wouldnt have undertaken it knowing it wasnt a possibility because he was a superb climber
1284582 it is interesting to note we all think that other people sleep better than we do the truth is we are all experiencing problems sleeping at night whether it is a problem on our mind or a problem with the bed we are lying on
1284583 although money problems seem to score lower than other issues that render us sleepless money worries could still be the real root of family problems work stress and health issues whatever the reason not getting enough sleep has far reaching effects on our personal and family lives our working performance our social contacts and even on our appearance
1284584 i can only hope and pray he will make a full recovery and can pick up the pieces of an active useful life but hes determined and competitive and we are optimistic he can make a 100 recovery
1284585 when he was approaching the landing mark he made an adjustment the parachute spun out of control the canopy hit the ground first and paul crashed to the ground we dont know how he survived it
1284586 indications are that his spine and head were not seriously injured and as a christian he is asking everyone at home to pray for him
1284587 it will be very difficult as he fights back to full fitness he has been involved in sports like amateur boxing karate track and field events and he will find this very tough
1284588 as a result of having various tubes down his throat during his time on a life support machine he cant actually talk but im told thats coming back although hes had to write to communicate with the doctors and nurses
1284589 id rather be in this position than going to beijing early after losing in the first round of course ideally id like to have more time to relax and get used to the venue and the whole olympic atmosphere but ill just have to deal with it
1284590 ive been playing a lot of matches but right now i feel fine both physically and mentally
1284591 the humidity this week was unbelievable it was well over 100 degrees out on court yesterday
1284592 ive played well in these conditions this week but theyre not conditions that you would want to play in all the time its tough after matches to make sure youre properly hydrated and eating the right sort of food you can lose quite a lot of weight playing in those conditions
1284593 the humidity gets to your breathing a little bit and gets you out of breath a lot obviously you sweat more which makes you feel more tired
1284594 it comes from training and the gym work that you do off the court because that eliminates all your possible excuses
1284595 you go on the court in great shape doing the right things because youve been doing the right things off the court you get on the court thinking about tennis not worrying whether youve practised enough or done enough work in the gym i feel much better physically
1284596 once youve beaten someone for the first time you have the feeling you can do it again
1284597 it also gets into the head of the other player when theyve beaten you a few times and then youve broken that run
1284598 i really want to buy a new snowmobile this year
1284599 it was reported that stones were thrown at a bus carrying football supporters on the glenshane road one of the windows was broken
1284600 the vast majority of people from the area who have contacted me do not want this type of violence we are very lucky there has not been a fatality from any of these incidents to date
1284601 it is staggering that 50m could have been spent on agency staff and now these have been brought into the public forum the minister should look at this issue carefully
1284602 he needs to ascertain why the trusts rely so heavily on agency staff as opposed to permanent staff so that it can be addressed
1284603 i would think that patients receive better care from people in permanent positions rather than from those who are coming and going all the time and when it comes down to it we should be making sure patients receive the best care possible
1284604 the rcn would support the view that as far as possible health care trusts should employ permanent staff
1284605 however it is also clear that these additional agency nurses were required to deliver safe patient care
1284606 we would be very concerned if trusts were using agency staff instead of committing to the recruitment of permanent nursing staff especially as the implications of the governments comprehensive spending review on nursing posts is unclear
1284607 the trust has an ongoing campaign of recruitment to minimise the need for agency staff however the appointment of agency staff can provide a vital temporary solution to urgent staffing requirements
1284608 we are working towards a reduction in reliance on agency nurses by appointing additional nurses to the trust
1284609 wexford have got where they are on merit no one will argue with that with winning comes confidence and although they lost the leinster final to dublin quite heavily wexford have got their season back on track again and they will certainly be up for meeting us

1284611 tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
1284612 an easier win than today or yesterday lets hope we bowl as well as we have been doing because the bowling has been excellent and the fielding today was just brilliant so we just need to put the batting together
1284613 its brilliant to be part of a world cup and im sure itll be something really exciting
1284614 you just have to see the guys faces in the dressing room realising theyre through to another world cup and the guys who werent there know what happened in the last one and to be part of it now its great for them
1284615 its about time we beat ireland we have a better side than ireland and we want to show some guys

1284644 champion the provision of high quality nutritious food in the capital
1284645 rosie is bursting with great ideas on how we can boost the level of top notch food grown locally and support londons local independent food industries and smaller shops
1284646 there are many aspects of our current food system which are damaging our environment through wasteful practices and producing poor quality food
1284647 it simply does not need to be the case that londoners cannot have access to locally produced top quality food but we have to have a radical rethink to find ways of making this happen

1284651 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1284652 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

1284823 these are conversations weve been having since we wrote the movie in 2002 they continue on through the release date with this one there were many discussions about the exact lesson we were imparting some people come up to me and say i cant believe theres no anti weed message and some people come up to me and and say i cant believe how strong an anti weed message there is its really whatever you take from it you take from it thats the way we balanced it out you dont have me saying im never smoking weed again but you dont have me saying hey everybody smoke weed all the time its somewhere in the middle i dont think you get the sense that these guys are going to stop smoking weed after this movie ends but i dont think you get the sense that thats necessarily the smartest thing either but i have no doubt that when you watch this movie you will want to smoke weed thats what i know i nailed judd on whether it has a message or not people will want to get high when they watch the movie theyll want to roll a cross joint
1284824 we were inspired by good and bad stoner movies certain things to stay away from and certain things we like the cheech amp chong movies were very cool when i first watched them but they didnt really have great stories per se they dont really hold up all that well i think if you didnt smoke weed you would not like those movies at all potentially movies like friday transcend a little bit they have a plot that is more than just two guys smokin weed the whole movie movies like the big lebowski are just about stoners they show that just because your main character is a stoner it doesnt mean the movie is primarily for stoners movies like half baked have some interesting cautionary tales i love that movie then the end is i never smoked weed again what the fuck what do you think im doing you make me wanna smoke weed for two hours then you make me feel guilty about it so we didnt wanna do that also we watched them all and took both good and bad lessons from them
1284825 anything that throws it in peoples faces is probably helpful
1284826 it gets people talking about it the fact that you asked me that question right now is a step in the right direction i would say but probably not laughs i wonder if pfizer has anything to say about it
1284827 we invented it for the purpose of the movie but im sure there will be now
1284828 if any weed dealers are smart theyll start naming some weed pineapple express
1284829 i smoked my fair share when i was younger but its not a part of my life any more
1284830 since im doing this movie a lot of these questions arise people ask do you really smoke weed and i dont know what to say if i say no its lame and if i say yes i can potentially get arrested and spend a lot of time in prison so im gonna say no but the answer is yes

1284859 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small

1284865 this study shows that a strategically designed video game can be a powerful new tool to enhance the impact of medical treatment by motivating healthy behavior in the patient
1284866 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
1284867 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient
1284868 weve discussed this a bit already but i think it makes sense to nail down a date for the beta 1 freeze date beta 1 is a feature freeze so if you have a feature you are working on its time to start wrapping it up after discussing dates with quite a few people and hearing people ask for more time august 19th seems appropriate thats a tuesday and we can take a look in that days firefox 3 1 meeting to see where things stand
1284869 theres still about 20 blockers for 3 1 1 9 1 we need to hit that list pretty hard over the next two weeks since blocking really means blocking those items need to be cleared before final for the 3 0 betas we had blockers that lasted past and into betas so i think it still makes sense to continue doing the same not all blockers will be resolved before beta theres about 89 or so blocking noms for 1 9 1 we have to hammer through those

1284894 estamos muy preocupados por esta noticia que tom estado p blico en estos ltimos d as donde se pretender a quitar el 10 por ciento de ingresos brutos que recibe la provincia para con los municipios lo que arrojar a que nosotros como municipio deber amos aportar una cifra de ocho millones de pesos que ser an volcados a un fondo para infraestructura
1284895 viene reclamando que el gobierno pague a la ciudad la deuda de treinta millones de pesos para volcarla a infraestructura porque con la recaudaci n propia no alcanza para esto frente a los compromisos de urbanizaci n
1284896 volvemos a pedir a la provincia que nos pague lo que nos debe y a la naci n le hemos presentado m s de veinte proyectos para financiamiento de infraestructura y nos encontramos con la sorpresa de que los legisladores van a sacarle a los municipios ocho millones de pesos para ser destinados a infraestructura donde van a un fondo que lo administrar una comisi n que lo tiene que decidir o sea creo que ac falta informaci n nosotros tenemos ya m s de cinco mil inscriptos en tierras fiscales porque toda la gente se volc masivamente al municipio para que le resuelva el problema dado que el gobierno no los puede resolver
1284897 me parece que los se ores legisladores o les ha faltado informaci n o les ha faltado di logo con nosotros porque no hemos sido convocados para dialogar en la legislatura y de pronto va a salir una sesi n especial para esto la pregunta es si el gobierno tiene los diecis is millones para aportar a este fondo por qu no nos paga la deuda a los municipios que hemos dado muestras claras de que podemos queremos y sabemos como urbanizar una tierra y no como el ipv que lleva cinco a os para ver si aunque sea puede conseguir un colector costero o cloacal y no lo ha conseguido todav a esto es lo que no entendemos
1284898 hubiera sido interesante que llamen sino quieren hablar con los intendentes hubieran hablado con los presidentes de los concejos deliberantes de las ciudades para decirles se ores les vamos a sacar la plata
1284899 hemos tenido problemas muy complicados con gobiernos anteriores y jam s nadie se anim a tocar la coparticipaci n de los municipios y de pronto nos encontramos que le van a quitar diecis is millones de pesos a r o grande y a ushuaia para crear un fondo es como que da la sensaci n de que este gobierno crea comisiones para no hacer nada
1284900 justamente el municipio de r o grande no necesit crear comisiones solo necesit de las ordenanzas que avalaron presupuestariamente la posibilidad de infraestructura como fue chacra xi en donde en menos de un a o urbanizamos 800 lotes
1284901 nos parece que hemos dado muestras claras de que queremos resolver la crisis habitacional
1284902 para ver c mo planteamos este tema a la naci n y buscar fondos para resolver los problemas de infraestructura pero con sorpresa vemos que se quiere sacar los recursos de lo que ellos creen supuestamente que somos ricos los municipios
1284903 le hemos planteado a la gobernadora para que lo resuelva pero plata no hay y de pronto nos sacan dinero de lo que ya no alcanza para ser distribuido en d nde
1284904 hoy escuchaba al legislador manuel raimbault decir con una alegr a b rbara que a los municipios les entra mucha plata y que por eso se lo iban a quitar no lo escuch nunca antes decir cosa semejante es como que se improvisa para ver de d nde se puede sacar un pesito
1284905 donde se avanz con el megapase nosotros advertimos sobre las consecuencias que pod a traer este masivo pase a planta al estado entonces hoy no pueden desconocer la realidad de la crisis habitacional ning n legislador nos llam a los intendentes ni a los concejales para plantearle a naci n sobre chacra xiii y haber podido resolver el problema
1284906 le expliqu a crocianelli que si nos quer an sacar ocho millones de pesos necesariamente y lo hab amos acordado hace unos d as de ir pagando la deuda en cuota de acuerdo a las posibilidades del gobierno provincial caer a en saco roto y nosotros tendremos que accionar judicialmente para recuperar la deuda para dar respuestas a los cinco mil inscriptos nosotros sabemos del problema no lo vamos a evadir ni vamos a buscar excusas para no resolver el problema habitacional
1284907 preg ntenos a nosotros que nosotros junto a los concejales le vamos a resolver el problema
1284908 le dijimos que hubi ramos visto con mucho agrado que los legisladores se hubiesen preocupado para que los municipios cobren parte de esta deuda y de esta manera s poner una afectaci n espec fica para tierras y esto lo hab amos planteado p blicamente a trav s de una solicitada ambos intendentes
1284909 como esto no lo han visto no lo han le do o no nos han cre do le dijimos a los legisladores del mpf que presenten un proyecto superador que le digan al gobierno de la provincia que las intendencias est n dispuestas a ceder los fondos previa autorizaci n de los concejos deliberantes para que la deuda que tiene la provincia que son m s de treinta millones si tomamos los intereses lo vuelquen a infraestructura en los pr ximos tres a os pero con el visto bueno de nosotros porque si tomamos en cuenta los 30 millones de r o grande m s los veinticinco millones de ushuaia sumado al cincuenta por ciento que debe poner el gobierno estar amos hablando de unos 120 millones de pesos ahora la provincia puede resolver esto con esta semejante suma de dinero no puede porque se est endeudando a raz n de 30 a 35 millones de pesos mensuales
1284910 tuvimos que ir a la justicia para que se reconozca la deuda que fue finalmente reconocida asumi el nuevo gobierno con esta deuda consolidada entendemos la delicada situaci n que este gobierno en gran parte hereda pero la actual gesti n tiene la responsabilidad de revertir la situaci n y hasta el momento no se ha revertido
1284911 nosotros entendemos que se pague en cuotas pero esta ciudad tiene muchas necesidades porque est creciendo en forma vertiginosa y permanentemente necesita de fondos frescos
1284912 pero debe parar ese proyecto en la legislatura que ni siquiera ser tratado en comisi n sino sobre tablas y pasar a formar parte de una ley que el ejecutivo no va a vetarla porque la gobernadora ya les manifest a los legisladores radicales que esta retenci n de fondos era un hecho y por eso el gobierno es part cipe de esta ley y por eso lamentablemente para toda la ciudadan a de tierra del fuego la clase pol tica deber volver a discutir lo que corresponde en los estrados judiciales
1284913 ser a una irresponsabilidad tomar una posici n sin consultar a todo el cuerpo pero s a t tulo personal considero que ning n concejal va a estar en contra de defender los intereses de la ciudad y la autonom a municipal por lo menos deber a ser as
1284914 creo que tenemos que analizar que la crisis habitacional no es un problema de ayer sino que es una situaci n que viene de larga data esto se incrementa y se transforma en una crisis mucho m s conflictiva para tierra del fuego a partir del 2005 en octubre con un primer asentamiento justamente por el barrio 15 de octubre en la margen sur y a partir de all se hicieron innumerables gestiones tanto desde el concejo deliberante como del propio ejecutivo municipal de r o grande
1284915 se lo quiere hacer ver como si fuera la soluci n a la crisis habitacional y a m me parece que no es la soluci n seguramente debe ser una buena y sana intenci n de los legisladores para encontrarle la vuelta al asunto
1284916 diez doce o quince millones de pesos de los municipios volcados a la crisis habitacional no resuelve la cuesti n de la crisis porque sta es mucho m s profunda
1284917 me parece que en el marco de lo que se estaba planteando hace un par de semanas de apertura al di logo del trabajo en conjunto con todas las instituciones esto viene ni m s ni menos a sembrar m s diferencias que concordancias donde hay un punto que se va a debatir mucho porque sienta un precedente importante ya que a nuestro parecer se est invadiendo las autonom as municipales para quitarles dinero que ser n volcados a resolver planteamientos que son municipales
1284918 no hay proyectos para solucionar la problem tica y seguramente esto va a generar una comisi n m s con mucho debate y mucho tiempo para brindar soluciones que ya se est n brindando por lo menos desde r o grande
1284919 nosotros vamos a salir a defender lo que son las autonom as municipales y los recursos que son de los municipios tambi n vamos a llevar proyectos para brindar soluci n a la crisis habitacional pero en el marco del di logo
1284920 aprovechando que tengo que estar en la reuni n del consejo econ mico y social para reunirnos con los legisladores y avanzar porque creo que los legisladores han partido desde una sana intenci n de buscar una soluci n a la crisis habitacional que ya lleva tres a os y en la cual todos estamos haciendo esfuerzos aislados y debemos reunirnos consensuar y acordar para encarar el problema desde todos los ngulos posibles y buscar cu l ser la mejor ley para resolver esta problem tica
1284921 asisto a este consejo en representaci n de una instituci n y obviamente no puedo sustentar una postura que debe ser consultada con el resto de los ediles con la informaci n de lo que se plantee en el seno de este consejo econ mico y social para llevar la postura mayoritaria de los concejales en cada uno de los temas que se planteen en el mismo
1284922 se ores legisladores tengo el agrado de dirigirme a ustedes a los efectos de transmitir la preocupaci n reinante en el municipio de r o grande en atenci n al dictamen favorable arribado respecto del proyecto de ley sobre la creaci n de un fondo de afectaci n espec fica el cual ser a conformado por el diez por ciento de los ingresos que percibe la provincia en concepto de impuestos sobre los ingresos brutos deducci n previa a la coparticipaci n que por ley la provincia realiza a los municipios y por ende existir a una disminuci n sensible de los ingresos de este municipio en aproximadamente 8 000 000 pesos ocho millones la mentada deducci n afectar a directamente sobre el plan de ejecuci n de obras p blicas previsto para el a o en curso como as tambi n el venidero ello sin ingresar en la presente a analizar la inconstitucionalidad que brota del proyecto en cuesti n toda vez que se afectan derechos consagrados en la constituci n nacional constituci n provincial y nuestra carta org nica municipal m s a n a fin de acercarlos a la realidad objetiva cabe informar a los se ores legisladores que el municipio de r o grande ha ejecutado la suma de 17 000 000 diecisiete millones en la urbanizaci n de la chacra xi aproximadamente 800 lotes al que sum ndole el valor de la tierra la inversi n total asciende a 35 000 000 aproximadamente y que debido a la ineficiencia del gobierno de la provincia respecto de la ausencia de soluci n en lo relativo al tendido de redes de cloacas en chacra xiii este municipio deber desembolsar la suma de 2 000 000 dos millones de pesos a fin de brindar respuesta a la necesidad que surge en la posesi n de los inmuebles sito en la chacra xi importa se alar que existe en registro de este municipio una inscripci n de m s de cinco mil personas con expectativas ciertas y reales de obtener terrenos en m rito al compromiso p blico asumido por esta gesti n de urbanizar cuatrocientos terrenos por a o debiendo postergarse dicha herramienta por la millonaria deuda generada por el gobierno de la provincia para con el municipio de r o grande que a la fecha asciende a 30 000 000 treinta millones de pesos la expectativa crece a diario debido en atenci n a la pronta respuesta del municipio como as tambi n a la ineficiencia del gobierno de la provincia en dar respuestas por las consideraciones expuestas es que se solicita a los se ores legisladores como propuesta superadora al proyecto en an lisis que dicten una herramienta legal que garantice el efectivo ingreso de los fondos adeudados por el gobierno de la provincia al municipio como as tambi n que dichas sumas tengan una afectaci n espec fica y por ende el destino de stas sea paliar la reinante crisis habitacional como p blicamente se comprometieran los intendentes municipales en la solicitada publicadas en los medios provinciales de mayor difusi n

1284967 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1284968 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1284969 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1284970 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1284971 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1284972 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1284973 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
1284974 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
1284975 there are too many unknowns in this study to make conclusions about the relationship between cough and cold medicine and altes
1284976 they raised a lot of possibilities but the question is what do you do in follow up
1284977 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1284978 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1284979 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1284980 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1284981 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1284982 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1284983 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1284984 and in any case the american movie industry rates itself
1284985 so how and why some movies get an r rating while others dont isnt always rational because its like the fox watching the chicken coop and the industry is not going to do anything that limits it from getting as wide an audience as possible
1284986 theres quite a lot of validity to what these researchers are saying
1284987 children are definitely far more able to access this kind of violent material and its potentially worrying but the evidence isnt really there yet that theres a negative consequence
1284988 but there just arent any studies that have shown a direct connection to problem behavior and what the connection is independent of a host of other factors for example children who are more violent in the first place tend to be the ones drawn more to material that is more violent so even the direction of any relationship is not clear
1284989 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1284990 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed
1284991 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
1284992 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1284993 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1284994 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of
1284995 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1284996 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to re educate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually

1285040 the focus is on reducing crime and the fear of crime and to do that we need to be in contact with communities
1285041 this hasnt just come out of thin air it has come from lots of people working together and playing their part
1285042 its about people retaking ownership of their communities people can come to us and voice their concerns over crime and behaviour in their communities

1285047 i wish on a selfish note that hed not done what he has done but im phenomenally proud of him
1285048 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1285049 this important move is not about pointing the finger it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1285050 im not sure all parents will understand what the measurements mean and what action they should take we are very good at pinpointing problems but not so good at deciding what needs to be done the government and trusts must make it clear what parents should do and who to turn to for advice
1285051 using video in this way gives the public a chance to see the type of work our fire crews are doing day in and day out and the challenging conditions they face

1285069 i would love them to start some bush fires up in the background

1285071 i am proud to have my us citizenship compared to georgia where i am from the training environment in the us is excellent
1285072 we are here to compete and we will focus on what we do best that is to swim fast whatever else other countries are doing is not of interest to us
1285073 i do not think this meet is just about us and the americans the french are strong the british finished fourth in the points at last years world championships and i think there will be several other countries that will win medals

1285075 athletes stand around for hours during the opening ceremony and if i have a swim the next day it is not the ideal preparation whatever needs to be done i will do even if it means missing the ceremony it is a sacrifice for my country

1285077 our performance in the first half of the year puts us firmly on track to achieve all of our financial targets for 2008
1285078 we have raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1285079 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1285080 to have a group of animals under such high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1285085 theyve worked hard theyve lived up to the other seniors expectations that they left for them theyll be fine
1285086 the rest of them are really going to have to learn quick
1285087 the first day is basically to focus on fundamentals as coaches were trying to find the best personnel to put in certain positions were putting in a little bit of offense and defense but mainly were trying to match personnel with where we need them
1285088 i think were looking much better weve been working hard since last season ended
1285089 the defense is always fun just to blast through the line and get to the ball carrier
1285090 shows that we have pride here and that we have committed players and coaches it means a lot to us i think it means a lot to everybody our community our football program period we take a lot of pride in what we do here
1285091 i just hope it continues to live up to the tradition and the expectations
1285092 im a senior so ive got to be a leader just show them how its done and help them out as much as i can
1285093 this year i think the guys we have have stepped up over the summer and through workouts and a lot of them played last year i think theyre just as capable to make plays too
1285094 right now honestly were not thinking about making it to the state championship i mean thatd be nice but right now were just focused on graham as our first game and on practice right now going out here and trying to get better every day
1285095 the whole team has worked really hard since january 2nd and now were really eager to get out onto the field and show how the hard work in the weight room has really paid off
1285096 a lot of people are coming back that were on the team last year people know how it feels to win and people want to win again
1285097 we have a lot of people that i know can do the job
1285098 a whole lot better than in the past weve got close to 70 kids here and that includes a large freshman class we were looking forward to getting them up here
1285099 these kids have worked hard since december and they were looking forward to the season were real happy with their attendance and their work habits
1285100 they were wanting to come at 12 oclock midnight and i did that once here last year it makes it tough the next two days getting them back to where they belong and get their rhythm back down we didnt do that this year
1285101 makes me feel like were going to have a good season everybody was happy
1285102 this first day was a whole lot easier because i was used to it all that training in the off season really helps out
1285103 just this last week i made a few mechanical adjustments kept my head down and just listened for it to drop

1285108 therefore to maintain and expand support until 2012 when three of the participating companies will have been funding the dstt for 14 years is unprecedented we must be doing something right
1285109 i am delighted that the agreement has been renewed as this will enable us to translate our recent research findings and ideas into potential new drug therapies for the treatment of cancer hypertension and parkinsons disease

1285121 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1285122 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1285123 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1285124 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1285125 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1285126 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1285127 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1285128 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention

1285146 its also great to welcome back northampton saints full houses at franklins gardens always provide a brilliant atmosphere last years guinness premiership was by far and away the greatest we have had and the world record crowd at twickenham for the guinness premiership final showed just how far professional club rugby in england has come
1285147 the east versus west midlands televised clash between northampton saints and worcester warriors sums up why i think this will be the best guinness premiership season so far the established traditional team northampton are on the rise with the new age worcester outfit looking to ensure that the old and new power struggle is turned on their head as chris latham joins them to add class grit and character in abundance

1285155 3i infotech is focused banking solution provider and they are focused on the bfsi spce they are into products and services they have got a vast geographical mix and therefore in a sense that their exposure to currency fluctuations in not very high there have been lot of focused acquisitions which have been plugging in a lot of the gaps they have had in their service offerings without compromising too much on profitability we are positive on that stock as well and we have a target of about rs 184
1285156 we have maintained our earnings estimates of rs 9 1 and rs 10 7 for fy09e and fy10e respectively at cmp of rs 89 the stock is trading at 9 9x fy09e and 8 4x fy10e earnings we maintain an accumulate rating for the stock target rs 128
1285157 while we remain positive on itcs strong consumer demand profile better pricing power strong cash flows and its ability to channel these flows into new growth opportunities a weak earnings growth in fy2009 coupled with uncertainty regarding cigarette volumes has led us to maintain our neutral view on the stock
1285158 bartronics india is the largest provider in rfid solutions in india and this business is pretty much at a nascent stage so going forward the organized retail market is expected to grow at about 38 cagr at about 2010 so that should help this particular segment as well also they are obviously taking a lot of global expansion in countries like the us and singapore so that should help for the growth in the segment
1285159 they are also the smart card manufacturers in india and going forward this particular segment is expected grow at a pretty strong space given the kind of growth expected to see in the telecom sector as well as in the government and in the banking verticals so these opportunities should open up post fy09 so going forward we think the company should hit about rs 30 in eps by fy10 so given that over about 25 to 30 cagr is what this company is capable of achieving so now the valuations are very much in single digits so we have a target of about a rs 249 on the stock right now

1285205 that fraction not so excreted about 31 was converted to body constituents through the one carbon metabolic pool
1285206 it was concluded that aspartame was digested to its three constituents that were then absorbed as natural constituents of the diet
1285207 exposure to methanol also results from the consumption of certain foodstuffs fruits fruit juices certain vegetables aspartame sweetener roasted coffee honey and alcoholic beverages health effects institute 1987 jacobsen et al 1988
1285208 experimental studies on the detailed time profiles following controlled repeated exposures to methanol are lacking
1285209 thus in monkeys and plausibly humans a much larger fraction of body formaldehyde is rapidly converted to unobserved forms rather than passed on to formate and eventually co
1285210 a major finding in this study was that the daily consumption of asp at the two doses considered leads to an increment in the concentration and activity of cyp2b1 2 cyp2e1 and cyp3a2 in rat cerebral and cerebellar microsomes the highest increment up to 25 fold over controls in a cyp associated activity induced by asp in brain was that of 4 nph corresponding to cyp2e1 the results mentioned above must be reproduced using a broad range of asp concentrations in order to define the existence of a dose related effect as far as we know this is the first report regarding modulation of brain cyps by the widely used sweetener asp specific induction of brain cyps could constitute a local regulatory mechanism of enzyme activity thus influencing drug response for tissues exhibiting low regenerative capacity such as the brain such modulation would probably be of major toxicological significance it has already been said that once asp enters the organism it is rapidly metabolized by intestinal esterases and dipeptidases to aspartic acid phenylalanine and methanol substances normally found in the diet and body 37 one hour after asp intake at a dose of 200 mg kg body weight by rats corresponding to the acceptable fda daily intake for the sweetener after species correction increased plasma and brain phenylalanine levels by 62 and 192 respectively 6 with regard to methanol it accounts for about 10 of the asp weight administered 38 we can hypothesize that the exposure to methanol at the two regimens used in this study about 7 5 and 12 5 mg kg from the doses of 75 and 125 mg kg could induce xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in a similar way to that of the chronic administration of ethanol 39 if methanol is the metabolite responsible for the induction of brain cyp2e1 seen in this work the question of why the hepatic cyp2e1 was not altered remains experiments with the three metabolites resulting from asp metabolism are currently being undertaken in our laboratory in order to address this question in conclusion data obtained demonstrated that a daily consumption of asp at doses of 75 and 125 mg kg body weight over 30 days provokes a substantial increment in cyp enzymes involved in endogenous and exogenous molecules metabolism in the cns of the rat biological consequences of this phenomenon should be investigated in view of the high number of humans exposed to this artificial sweetener and because of the recent data indicating the potential carcinogenic effects of this compound 41
1285211 the aim of this study was to explore the effect of orally ingested asp upon the expression and activity of cyp families involved in the cns of rats the chosen asp doses of 75 and 125 mg kg body weight used in this study are within the limits of human consumption after species factor correction because rats metabolize asp faster than humans 31 dose comparisons between them have usually been corrected by a factor of 5 after correction doses used here are below the fda 50 mg kg body weight and health and welfare canada 40 mg kg body weight acceptable daily intake for asp 32 33
1285212 recent studies have shown that neurodegeneration is closely related to misfolding and aggregation of neuronal tau
1285213 the significant protein tau aggregation induced by formaldehyde and the severe toxicity of the aggregated tau to neural cells may suggest that toxicity of methanol and formaldehyde ingestion is related to tau misfolding and aggregation
1285214 neuronal tau is an important protein in promoting and stabilizing the microtubule system involved in cellular transport and neuronal morphogenesis
1285215 both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde can go through the blood brain barrier and cause some lesions to cns especially our visual system 38
1285216 formaldehyde exposure leads to formation of dna protein crosslinks a major mechanism of dna damage

1285320 although socrates story of the afterlife appears to be a gratuitous addition to the dialogue it can be shown that socrates is implying that some sort of religious myth is essential to bringing into existence and to sustaining a regime that is ruled not by orators like polus or callicles but by philosopher statesmen like socrates

1285348 our study has increased medical knowledge and allowed us to help individual patients by sharing technological advancements
1285349 we are obtaining a better understanding of the prevalence of hematopoietic diseases in china while at the same time having an impact on peoples lives by providing the citizens of shanghai the same advanced diagnostics that patients at modern western medical centers receive
1285350 it serves as an example that high quality state of the art research is possible in china
1285351 this is our inspiration to see that those who suffer now and in the future get a chance at survival
1285352 we believe the phenomenal growth in the team sarcoma initiative in the last few years is indicative of the pent up need for individuals and families who have been affected by this disease to interact with each other and their doctors and nurses in a setting other than the traditional hospital setting
1285353 we hear stories of amazing resiliency in the face of adversity of incredible courage when faced with treatments that are not stopping the growth of tumors of people who truly inspire us with the way they carry on with their lives in spite of the aftermath of numerous surgeries and extensive treatments these stories tug at your heart when you hear them you know that you must do something to make more people aware of this rare cancer and to support research to find a cure for it
1285354 battles fought on the soccer field carried a special meaning that night
1285355 my initial hopes were a handful of ryans friends participating in the
1285356 i am so delighted with this amount as i never thought in my wildest dreams that this little letter writing campaign would generate such a tremendous response im receiving so many notes from people thanking me for helping to bring sarcoma awareness to the people of this state
1285357 this is a remarkable coming together of institutions focused on a common goal to contribute to global knowledge of the sarcoma problem with an ultimate mission to eradicate this disease the team sarcoma events provide an opportunity to collaborate more effectively with other institutions working on the same problem by highlighting the need for teamwork
1285358 especially important is the fact that this is the patients initiative and the number of participants is increasing it means that this problem is recognized by more people and it provides the chance for improvement of sarcoma treatment
1285359 the most moving aspect of the knit a thon was the response i got from total strangers we advertised our event in the local newspaper and had several participants whom wed never met before this event has the potential to grow so much in fact ive already started planning for next year
1285360 patients seek out breast reduction surgery for many reasons not the least of which is to ease pain and discomfort associated with having larger breasts
1285361 however there is also an emotional discomfort as well including low self esteem social and sexual embarrassment and frustration with difficulties in performing daily routines it was our goal to determine quantitatively whether these emotional issues improved as well as the physical
1285362 this study further demonstrates that the connection between the aesthetic results of plastic surgery and the emotional social and physical quality of life of our patients cannot be underestimated
1285363 these findings will go a long way towards helping us to evaluate and better understand the implications of the impact of plastic surgery on patients lives and serve as an example of our commitment to evidence based medicine and outcome studies in aesthetic surgery
1285364 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm

1285366 the privacy provisions included in this legislation provide an excellent foundation for addressing privacy and data security in an electronic medical record system
1285367 the privacy provisions were adopted because of the vital leadership of senate president therese murray speaker salvatore dimasi senators richard moore and harriette chandler as well as representatives byron rushing and patricia walrath
1285368 we look forward to continuing to work with these leaders and the legislature to make sure the commonwealth strengthens privacy protections to enhance public trust in an electronic medical record system
1285369 we need to engage them we need to take care of them we should not forget about them
1285370 world leaders are finally saying the right things but they need to follow their words with actions
1285371 the failure of the global fund pepfar the world bank and the worlds other global health bodies to devote significant resources toward reducing hiv rates among msm is indefensible these organizations have policies on women drug users migration but not one of them has a comprehensive policy on msm
1285372 unfortunately when it comes to human rights and hiv somewhere between the declarations and the practice many governments fall into a hole that is especially true when sexuality is introduced into policy debates
1285373 governments should be concerned about the corrosive effects on broader society both epidemiologically and otherwise that arise when they repress people on the basis of sexuality
1285374 the decision to exclude puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence analysis is perplexing the cdc made a positive step forward in its original decision to include hispanics but has subsequently taken two steps back by again excluding puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence rates we will never have accurate estimate of hiv incidence in the hispanic community if this discrimination continues
1285375 we call on everyone to mobilize demand respect and call for recognition from cdc of the health crisis that hiv aids represents in our latinohispanic communities in the united states puerto rico and the u s virgin islands
1285376 we will not allow our experience of the epidemic to be invisible our health crisis is real we want an accurate picture of the impact of hiv aids now
1285377 your doctor will be able to help you determine if you will be able to sufficiently tolerate conditions in beijing
1285378 your doctor will also be able to work with you to develop a disease management plan to ensure the healthiest trip possible that may include increasing the dosage levels of certain medications while in beijing
1285379 not only does smoking add to the pollution but will also make for an even greater strain on your lungs the american lung associations freedom from smoking online program is a valuable resource for those who want to break free from nicotine
1285380 to keep healthy while in beijing limit or avoid outdoor exercise
1285381 if you choose to exercise do so early in the day or in the evening if you feel any discomfort including coughing or wheezing you should stop immediately
1285382 if at any time you are outdoors and experience shortness of breath or excessive coughing or wheezing go inside immediately and take appropriate action
1285383 dont assume face masks are going to solve the problem
1285384 while n95 face masks may provide some benefit most commercially available air masks were not designed to protect against all forms of air pollution for example they dont protect against gases like ozone smog which will be one of the important components of the air in beijing
1285385 the beijing olympics calls the worlds attention to the seriousness of air pollution that focus needs to continue long after the games end
1285386 decades of hard work tackling air pollution in the united states mean that we no longer have beijing levels of air pollution but even our problem isnt solved we still have too many americans breathing dangerous sometimes fatal air pollution in their own backyards
1285387 approval by the fda of the study design this year allows us to move forward quickly to prove the efficacy of the assay approval by the agency of the results of this study that we expect early next year will provide us the ability to market our assay commercially
1285388 weve stated often our support for this deal and the belief that its important not only for the bilateral relationship but also for nuclear security in the rest of the world
1285389 but now that the iaea has voted were going to look to discuss this issue with the members of the nuclear suppliers group were hoping to get a positive result out of that some time in the next month
1285390 and then hopefully well be able to represent this to congress on september 8
1285391 were going to be working with our contacts on the hill to explain why we believe this is important and hopefully well be able to have a positive outcome of this
1285392 from the beginning he did not like her and at last he killed her
1285393 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1285394 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1285395 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1285396 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1285397 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1285398 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1285399 this revolutionary molecular testing technology allows the healthcare provider a cost effective diagnostic tool which can identify multiple infectious diseases faster and with far more accuracy than any other test available
1285400 our tem pcr test can differentiate between the sometimes fatal mrsa staph aureus and other forms of staph this is important because non mrsa patients can be treated with more effective and often less expensive drug therapies and without the need for patient isolation in less than four hours tem pcr can identify four types of staph and three types of antibiotic resistance our test delivers accurate diagnostic information that will provide physicians the exact information they need to administer specific and effective infectious disease treatment tem pcr technology is also an enormous benefit to hospitals from a business and financial perspective in addition to identifying the most efficient treatment protocols hospitals will now be able to determine whether a patient has an infection at the time of admission thereby determining whether treatment is reimbursable this will be vital information for hospitals if medicare decides to deny reimbursement for hospital acquired infections after october 1
1285401 infections are a challenge for all hospitals both clinically and in terms of financial reimbursement
1285402 however it is important to understand that mrsa represents less than 5 percent of total hospital infections massive attention is being paid to all infections whether hospital or community acquired because of the impending medicare regulations in addition to mrsa healthcare facilities across the country are inundated with other infections all of which can be more cost effectively and rapidly identified through this new and exciting technology early precise and cost effective treatment can now be achieved with genetic accuracy we can now provide tem pcr to medical facilities all across the country and patients can start to benefit from this advance in genetic science later this year we will release our hospital acquired infection panel which identifies 16 of the most common hospital acquired infections and our respiratory panel which will test for 21 respiratory pathogens both viral and bacterial all in a single molecular test
1285403 once registered for the park and ride you will receive a colour coded voucher at registration which will be the ticket for the bus
1285404 mobile pointsmen will be available to assist in directing traffic in and out of the venue
1285405 at each point there will be three bins to differentiate among the types of materials to be placed in them

1285407 the monsoon session has its own importance but it seems that there is no possibility of a monsoon session although it was announced by the government earlier
1285408 i would call upon the government to convene the monsoon session at the earliest so that important issues facing the country including the terror situation jammu and kashmir the amarnath agitation and price rise could be discussed
1285409 college attendance is commonly associated with self improvement and upward mobility yet this research suggests that college may actually encourage rather than deter social deviance and risk taking
1285410 juvenile delinquency college attendance and the paradoxical role of higher education in crime and substance use
1285411 we hope this trial will be viewed as timely and beneficial research in an area where there is clearly a demonstrated need for safe and effective products to treat cold and flu in children who suffer from these ailments much more than adults
1285412 these results are promising and support the development of a childrens formulation
1285413 current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use nhps
1285414 the study shows that eprotirome can be given safely with statins and has significant therapeutic efficacy on ldl cholesterol triglycerides and lipoprotein a over and above the effect of statin the unique clinical efficacy tolerability and safety make this combination a potentially attractive therapy for patients who cannot achieve their treatment goals with statin alone karo bio will proceed with its communicated strategy with the aim to develop eprotirome through phase iii with a partner
1285415 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1285416 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1285417 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed
1285418 president calderons repeal of the requirement that drug companies have manufacturing plants in mexico in order for any company to import use or sell generic copies of drugs is tremendous news for mexicans in desperate need of access to lifesaving medications for hiv aids and other diseases
1285419 i believe president calderons actions earlier today came in no small measure thanks to the ongoing advocacy efforts of a growing group of dedicated activists in mexico who have been pushing the government and industry on this issue we salute president calderon for his forward thinking action which should dramatically improve and save the lives of countless mexicans it was the right thing for president calderon to do with or without the pressure from activists he did it and we thank him for overturning this outdated requirement
1285420 breakfast is such an important part of the day and it is crucial we start with the right foods for us as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle we must understand the effects some foods can have as many of us suffer needlessly with uncomfortable symptoms this list shows that its not always the unhealthiest foods that can cause us problems and its always best to be tested to ensure you are making the right diet choices in my opinion a smoothie using fruits with rice milk goats milk or yoghurt or a grapefruit would be a great way to start the day
1285421 if you suffer from food intolerance some of the foods you consume particularly in the morning could really be affecting your lifestyle symptoms such as irritable bowels migraines asthma and fatigue are synonymous with other conditions they are often wrongly diagnosed and remain a real burden yorktest com offers foodscan 113 a clinical testing service provided directly to consumers it identifies problem foods and provides a solution that could change your life
1285422 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1285423 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1285424 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1285425 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1285426 this represents a significant milestone for the company in our quest to improve early melanoma detection
1285427 we would like to thank the dedicated physicians nurses and staff at our clinical trial sites and most notably the patients for their willingness to participate in this landmark study
1285428 we really dont know how the system works we need to get used to it we have to sort out glitches if there are any in the beginning
1285429 pills are very common but are not really the most effective types of drugs
1285430 they have to get through the intestinal tract and go across the body as a whole generally to get somewhere else
1285431 if you give the medication by inhaler it will go to precisely where its needed
1285432 were a package for a drug the drug company gets the package puts the drug inside it and the product is theirs its the same as when they sell a drug via pill or injection they can sell it as inhalable drug instead
1285433 small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1285434 the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1285435 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1285436 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1285437 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1285438 we are very excited about the breakthrough in image quality that this system offers
1285439 oct could revolutionise the surveillance of pre cancers in the mouth and eliminate the waiting time for biopsy results it should also minimise surgery through improved disease mapping this will provide cost effective treatments with improved cure rates
1285440 since our initial investment mdl has successfully built and trialled a prototype in vivo machine the companys ex vivo product has been clinically validated in gloucester royal hospital and university college hospital on cervical oesophageal and oral cancer tissues several sales have been made including to university college hospital sheffield university and the national physical laboratory tenders for machines are out with a number of hospitals and universities
1285441 this funding will enable the company to bring new oct products to market and to demonstrate their potential to solve significant unmet medical needs in multi billion pound markets worldwide we are tremendously excited by the confidence shown in michelson diagnostics by our investors catapult venture managers london seed capital lsc and london business angels
1285442 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
1285443 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death
1285444 maternal death in the 21st century causes prevention and relationship to cesarean delivery
1285445 we are pleased that tipranavir showed such a positive efficacy and safety profile in treatment experienced children who have fewer treatment options than adults and need more therapy choices including therapies that have been specially formulated to meet their needs
1285446 there are many children and adolescents with hiv who fail to maintain viral suppression of the disease which speaks to the urgent need for a new generation of therapies designed specifically for this group
1285447 for these treatment experienced children who have had limited options for maintaining an active and durable treatment regimen we now have evidence that tipranavir is effective and tolerable
1285448 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1285449 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1285450 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1285451 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1285452 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1285453 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1285454 there may be potential for synergy between topical arv microbicide use and vaccination as a two pronged strategy for preventing infection with hiv
1285455 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
1285456 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this programme and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
1285457 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1285458 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
1285459 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
1285460 our priority in the coming months is to drive usage among our subscribers and generate momentum to put us back on the growth track

1285473 from the agents perspective it is all about day to day desktop applications and the many different corporate systems that supply essential customer data many of which arent integrated so were regularly relying on agents to bring all these different components together said the report
1285474 over a third of agents are using five or more application passwords to carry out their daily role while 30 per cent of agents spend more than five minutes each logging into applications at the start of the day
1285475 it is time for the corporate it function to spend more time in the contact centre fixing these issues contact centres are an essential part of a successful customer experience and organisations need to ensure that their core it systems share the same best practice approach that theyre already applying to their often lower value e commerce operations
1285476 the new supercomputer is an important step in delivering our strategic targets
1285477 why do you think they were too scared to talk about the real problem stopping this project
1285478 i guess i really need to work on creating a more open environment but i think i have a personality problem its hard to talk about a personality conflict in the middle of a meeting thats why it was so weird we couldnt talk about the real problem so we couldnt talk about anything at all
1285479 so how do intend to create an environment where your team can deal with the real problem and get back to productive work
1285480 i guess i need to pull the two project leaders aside and talk to them in private
1285481 what if i told you in the long run that would make matters worse
1285482 by the same token the companys doing pretty well and were really happy with what were doing so well see i mean anything is possible
1285483 purity is natural we come into this world with all the right instincts we are innocent and therefore perceive things as they should be rather than how they are our conscience is clear our hands are clean and the world at large is truly beautiful it is at this time we feel most blessed to begin feeling young again we must begin with the most basic step of all the daily ritual of cleansing
1285484 at the end of each day or at the beginning of each morning take a small amount of purity made simple a little water and massage onto skin for 30 60 seconds rinse take a leisurely pace when washing yourself clean cleanliness is a new beginning when you feel clean you can begin being who you really are
1285485 the postponement calls are dead and buried the top concern now is peace and order i still discount it but you can never be sure we dont know what the moro islamic liberation front milf will do because of the tro
1285486 the milf will react very badly im sure theyll be angry hopefully no one will react violently
1285487 i was never bothered i knew that no bill will make it to law given the time

1285491 i am concerned about ageing odor and know there are anti ageing odor products but have not bought them myself
1285492 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odorless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1285493 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odor products is growing
1285494 people are paying more attention to the size tag than the price tag and feeling down when they cant fit their standard size
1285495 people should aim for the perfect fit not the perfect size and work with any outfit to ensure it enhances their individual body shape
1285496 however having an accurate sizing standard based on scientific data will allow designers to have consistent sizes and ensure the consumer feels good about their fashion experience
1285497 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1285498 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1285499 katie courics contract with cbs is legendary youd expect to see her there on the list
1285500 it is a great opportunity for fashion brands to get involved in something quite big and heroic

1285503 del montes answer is in response to sulpicios baseless and unjustified lawsuit that was meant to divert the publics attention from sulpicios gross negligence and recklessness and to avoid sulpicios liability for the cargo and expenses to retrieve it
1285504 considering these sulpicios plea of ignorance of the cargos dangerous nature runs afoul of its duty as common carrier to exercise extraordinary diligence
1285505 we cannot sacrifice the quality of the report so we are conducting two or three more hearings and we will submit our report friday next week

1285508 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
1285509 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
1285510 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil

1285552 my dear tupperware is the greatest thing since sliced bread its a revolution in food storage its the enemy of bacteria and spoilage its the ally of convenience its a product thats ready to take dubonet by storm
1285553 well maybe its the first time shes been able to afford it glenn
1285554 that still doesnt explain why she would wear this stuff under her dress
1285555 glenn dorothy is as good as youre gonna get and you know it and besides you fuck around on her all the time
1285556 i suppose the old boy that gave you this car expects something back for it
1285557 listen glenn reeves dont you say a word to me about anything
1285558 hell never play the piano maybe you ought to take piano lessons
1285559 upper class people have grand pianos in their homes and this house is perfect for it right where its at at the foot of the staircase
1285560 it seemed really long at the beginning but then it was august 2nd and it seemed so short
1285561 it was a great experience we made a lot of new friendships with guys we played against and we all really bonded well together
1285562 it was such a great feeling knowing we represented new hampshire well
1285563 it was by far the toughest camp and it definitely got us ready for the next step and it paid off the most at the end
1285564 you play against kids from exeter and bishop guertin and dont enjoy them but when you come here everyone gets along
1285565 i told him he couldnt go to iowa couldnt take the scholarship couldnt let his son get slammed into by 300 lb football players
1285566 i explained that the spondylolisthesis was likely to be unstable and that further impact could lead to severe back problems and possible partial paralysis
1285567 i saw a case in arkansas another young football player with a bilateral pars defect at l5 it was in perfect alignment with the sacrum there was no displacement only the stress fracture of the pars
1285568 he was clipped terribly while playing ball and unilaterally fractured the pars of l4 but l5 never moved a millimeter he had enough trauma for an acute unilateral break of the pars at l4 however l5 remained stable
1285569 these two dramatic cases within six months of each other said to me that maybe i didnt make the right decision
1285570 of course the boys back pain had responded to my treatment because most people who have inactive spondylolysis and or spondylolisthesis get better with chiropractic care after all the pain has nothing to do with the spondylolysis and or spondylolisthesis itself after five or six adjustments he was fine id see him on and off again in church and i always thought he had a funny look in his eye when he saw me the fact is i made a spondylo athletic invalid out of that boy and ill always regret it
1285571 look at the literature and youll be unable to find one case of a patient in a work industrial or sports related environment who has had trauma causing spondylolisthesis to slip further and produce neurological deficit or paralysis
1285572 so what weve been doing as clinicians is treating and managing patients based on an eventuality that has yet to occur its absurd its insanity and its not justified by the scientific literature
1285573 about 20 years ago dr james cox and i were lecturing and another doctor of chiropractic came up and talked to me about his son a great running back on his way to the university of indiana who had an l5 spondylolisthesis and lowback pain
1285574 i asked him hows he doing hes getting better the dc said that was no surprise to me i told him to put his son in some kind of brace to give support to his back rest him a little bit and then let him play the son made first string at indiana and had no major recurrence of lower back problems and no neurological damage of course i was placing myself at a huge risk to say that 20 years ago and i told thousands of chiropractors the same thing
1285575 sophisticated imaging modalities such as single photon emission computed tomography spect bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging mri scans of the spine have provided the clinician with the ability to evaluate the physiological changes that are associated with spondylolysis
1285576 prior to that plain film radiographs and ct scans only allowed us to evaluate the anatomy of the actual defect or the displacement associated with the defect
1285577 active or inactive spondylolysis and or spondylolisthesis whats the real cause of back pain
1285578 the real key is that if you do a spect or an mri an active spondylolysis would show uptake on the spect scan and an mri would show bone marrow edema adjacent to the pars defect that tells us that there is activity associated with the pars defect and that its likely to be symptom producing because we can image physiological changes in the bone that then drives the patient management
1285579 look past the inactive spondylolisthesis for a biomechanical cause of the lower back pain
1285580 clinically most cases are asymptomatic or discounted as growing pains resulting in failure to recognize their existence
1285581 because they are not identified immobilization and stabilization do not occur resulting in improper healing
1285582 anything that causes the patient to perform repetitive hyperextension of the lumbar spine
1285583 all i know is that this 2008 team we push each other
1285584 we all want that hardware all we think about is gold medals thats what we dream about the way i see it we should bring a pile home
1285585 i expect them to win at least three gold medals at these games
1285586 they are better now they are coming here as world champions these guys are motivated and they will do really well
1285587 one of the reasons i took them to colorado springs is because last time we had a great team some of the best boxers in the world but every time they went home they boxed in a style that had nothing to do with the olympics
1285588 their speed is a full team speed we got tired chasing them they got on a roll in the second half and didnt let up
1285589 we adjusted our blocking up front and went with fresh backs once ferriter got going there was no stopping that offense
1285590 weve been practicing two and three times a day thats what we wanted was a goose egg the offense stepped it up big in the second half
1285591 this is without doubt the most exciting digital photography announcement this year
1285592 throughout their history they have been unable and unwilling to participate in public life
1285593 i dont know any other land where a man breathes so freely

1285598 they put these videos on the ufc where i said the fight was going to be a
1285599 it was in no way a disrespect to kenny its just with all the shit ive been through as a kid fighting kenny is a cakewalk anyway when it comes down to it it really is just a fight its just a fight
1285600 i know dale earnhardt jr isnt doing appearances for free
1285601 the truth is i dont really care if i fight in the ufc or somewhere else
1285602 for a company that is as loyal to me as i am to them
1285603 me being very new nobody wants to follow a loser i dont want to say my back is against the wall but i put pressure on myself theres no added pressure in my mind but i want to win the fight
1285604 i had a dominant position and i stood up and made an amateur mistake
1285605 we worked on all aspects of wrestling a lot of jiu jitsu defense a lot of leg kick defense heath has a strong right hand and is well rounded with his kicks we havent left any rock unturned for this fight
1285606 nobody likes to lose i have to be a little more relaxed im a little more relaxed and a little more polished ive had a few more months to train the brock lesnar now against the brock lesnar then id beat him
1285607 i said from the beginning i didnt want any easy fights and heath is not an easy opponent
1285608 for me ive been able to get a lot of experience in the training room
1285609 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
1285610 in the first inning he got a good fastball up and away and he pounded it to right its not easy to play on the road thats pretty good
1285611 were close friends off the field ill talk to him tonight
1285612 he was able to foul off some pretty good pitches and i got him
1285613 the last one was up and off the plate a little and i swung through it
1285614 he started throwing his breaking ball and he had enough on his fastball he made some pretty good pitches
1285615 i kind of sat back on it and pena was aggressive it fell in that little spot where we both wanted to make that last out and we should have talked more but soria came up big at the end
1285616 they were swinging at a lot of pitches up in the zone and luckily thats kind of where my release point was today and i got away with it
1285617 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
1285618 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
1285619 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression

1285621 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1285622 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1285623 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1285624 always be ready to speak your mind and a base man will avoid you

1285630 in the busiest area in the town we did not find a single person carrying a weapon
1285631 there have been two serious incidents in the vicinity of the high street in waltham cross in the past month which have resulted in four young men being seriously injured
1285632 we are taking a proactive approach to preventing any further incidents from occurring
1285633 this operation has sent out a strong message that carrying a weapon is a criminal offence and will not be tolerated
1285634 at the same time the isps are making only slow progress in winning over the 9 6 million households which are still without internet access at all the fall in broadband adds was entirely predictable on the basis of these trends and in fact sales have been slightly better than historic performance suggested
1285635 it is understandable that an isp ceo should blame his shrinking broadband numbers on the economy rather than lack of foresight or declining market share its his job to put the best face on things but it gives a misleading impression of how well the broadband business is doing
1285636 the pattern of declining quarterly adds has been clear for several years it has been fairly consistent year on year with q2 usually being the worst quarter but expenditure on broadband is clearly a vulnerable part of the household budget the next test in 2008 will be how well q3 bounces back from the q2 trough

1285668 personally i think the idea of appealing to individual markets is an interesting idea i think the idea of putting rpgs into local languages is very cool as well but that part of my post was hitting on the idea of using just more than the language to get a game to appeal but rather the history and culture of the area as well as farcical as my game is i find it just a little strange to use a dungeon bashing game as the means of bridging this and yes i do realize d amp d has done this but im curious if rpgs emerged organically elsewhere what form and content it would take

1285673 to sum up it seems the message behind these posters is
1285674 men should help women carry things but must not help women carry their handbags
1285675 lastly there was one rule on a poster about proper behavior for commuters and pedestrians that seemed a bit odd
1285676 it sounds to me as if the people are being asked to mobilize into tactically advantageous walking formations so as to maximize protection for women and elderly against rough and rowdy foreign hordes which will soon be threatening the safety of beijings streets and sidewalks with unchecked groping and thieving
1285677 we will review that at the end of the year
1285678 during that time we had an individual focused on his footy living within those parameters and his life and his footy was at a peak
1285679 in a lot of ways we started to turn him around probably one of those regrets in hindsight is taking those boundaries away and maybe the freedom sent the wrong message
1285680 its acceptable that if this didnt happen we wouldnt have sat down to look at who were going to trade or not trade or look at that list
1285681 that will be done at the end of the year seriously i think thats appropriate at the moment we cant give an answer to that because we havent asked ourselves that question seriously

1285716 led technology has come a long way from semiconductor components to sustainable lighting solutions we continue to focus our attention into the research and development of led light source to create new products with long life energy savings and substantial light output
1285717 these colored led retrofit bulbs are simply a stop on the track to the upcoming white led lamps as true equivalents to incandescent and halogen lamps for general illumination
1285718 as new standards are implemented around the world for solid state lighting solutions understanding the behavior of the leds over time in a wide range of environments will be critical led datasheets generally only provide a single forward current or a single junction temperature data point when publishing lifetime information
1285719 the lrt gives designers the flexibility to select from a wide range of led currents junction temperatures and target lifetimes to instantly evaluate the impact of modifying these variables on the reliability of the lighting system

1285722 fox groups key patents are for silicon carbide with low defect density which is especially desirable for leds rf devices and high power semiconductors at this time non exclusive licenses are still available to companies in the silicon carbide industry worldwide since fox group is not making silicon carbide wafers or devices we are happy to have our patents being utilized by our licensees
1285723 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1285724 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1285725 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
1285726 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1285727 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1285728 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1285729 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1285730 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
1285731 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1285732 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
1285733 but this one will be more focused on showing tips amp tricks on how to use technology in our personal and professional life utilizing what we already have or can have for free

1285742 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues

1285747 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1285748 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1285749 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1285750 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1285751 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1285752 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
1285753 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success

1285775 two days later when we got back to some serious training he let us be known in no uncertain terms that the season is only two weeks away
1285776 he told us that we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves stop thinking about who were going to bring in stop thinking about everything else that is going on and to just get on with playing football
1285777 we cant do anything about whats happening with transfers and the other speculation all we can do is play football and apart from lee carsley its the same starting xi that was here last season so we have no excuses
1285778 a couple of new players now would give us all a big lift but if that doesnt happen then weve still got a big enough squad to go into the start of the season
1285779 if somebody comes in from abroad then itll take him more than a few weeks to settle in
1285780 even if they are from england who knows how long it will take for them to learn our system and the other players
1285781 it takes time for anybody to bed in the players who are playing at the moment are going to be the ones who start against blackburn
1285782 they say results dont matter in pre season but they do in a way
1285783 theres been a little bit of negativity surrounding the club this week
1285784 the team has realised in the last few days that the season is now just two weeks away and we need to hit the ground running
1285785 this was more like it we played against a very fit team and for large parts of the game we did well
1285786 these weaknesses entail risks to the funds legitimacy which in turn has a bearing on its effectiveness
1285787 the board should meet less frequently a refocused board could perhaps meet for one week a month allowing more time for board members to consult their authorities and to do the background work needed to have greater impact during meetings
1285788 there is evidence of a chilling effect that deters directors and their authorities especially those from low income countries from challenging management and staff views for fear of negative repercussions
1285789 the sine qua non for a legitimate and effective imf is accountability including evaluation transparency participation and an external complaint mechanism to date the boards non response to this ieo report is further evidence of the absence of accountability at the imf
1285790 is outdated and undermines efforts at transparency particularly with respect to external audiences
1285791 although the interpretation of code words has evolved over time there is currently in the interest of transparency and good governance no ambiguity in their usage
1285792 current criteria to classify documents as strictly confidential and secret should be reviewed and made public also criteria should be made public for the declassification of strictly confidential and secret documents
1285793 common positions on international issues so that we can speak with a strong single voice once accomplished the logical next step will be to consolidate our representation and obtain a single seat in international fora
1285794 the problem is not whether the europeans should have a single chair in the imf the world bank and other international institutions the question is whether or not they are able to have a single policy because having several chairs in different institutions is not a problem as long as they all say the same thing
1285795 this original commit is a work in progress there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1285796 the web has faced fragmented video standards for over a decade now imagine if image standards had been this poorly supported
1285797 everyones experienced broken video support whether it be a flash plug in that crashes an unsupported browser
1285798 if these things were to just work that would be a huge improvement in the browsing experience we will have the same user experience with videos and other multimedia that we currently have with images

1285800 you get this tipping point most people use it so i want to use it kind of thing
1285801 eventually the platform represents a significant point and then all of a sudden stuff thats proprietary looks kind of stranded and obsolete
1285802 its not like some magic is going to happen these kind of things tend to move over time kind of like the firefox browser itself
1285803 its not like microsoft hasnt used ogg in the past the halo games for pc used ogg vorbis for all of their music for instance
1285804 its apple and nokia who stand to lose the most they make money every time a proprietary codec is used

1285826 i tried to get up and he pushed me back down and then i tried to get up again and then he started swinging and punching me i started blocking my face then i fell down again
1285827 i burned my hands trying to put the fire out then he went to tamika he put a lot on her
1285828 i didnt even know i was stabbed thats why my lung collapsed
1285829 i didnt find out she was dead until the next day we have no idea no clue why he did it maybe it was something personal between them
1285830 what were trying to do is put more teeth into our ordinance

1285835 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1285836 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs

1285845 ever since amazon launched the kindle last november weve been wondering about just how successful its been the electronic book initially sold out and supplies have been tight the kindle is such a small part of amazons overall business that the company does not break out how many its sold but we found out anyway 240 000 kindles have been shipped since november according to a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers doing a little back of the envelope math that brings total sales of the device so far to between 86 million and 96 million the price of the device was reduced to 360 from 400 last may then add the amounts spent on digital books newspapers and blogs purchased to read on the device and you get a business that has easily brought in above 100 million so far each 25 worth of digital reading material purchased per kindle add 6 million in total revenues
1285846 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1285847 if you dont quit something bad will happen to you
1285848 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1285849 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1285850 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1285851 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1285852 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1285853 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1285854 the luck of participating in an olympics held in our motherland is a once in a century opportunity and a dream that our predecessors have fought to fulfill for 100 years
1285855 this is a historical chance for us we are burdened with a glorious mission
1285856 but only winning a gold medal means nothing if the peoples health is not so good
1285857 yao ming is a very important development in u s china relations because a vast majority of americans dont know much about chinese people
1285858 probably has done more to increase u s china understanding than either government could have done now americans can see someone of flesh and blood with viewpoints and feelings
1285859 the governor has been pushing republicans and democrats to come to a compromise
1285860 it is very difficult for the economy to recover with the heavy hand of the government treasury in its pocket
1285861 this is mr salesman the guy who could sell anything
1285862 if hes going to sell his party on a sales tax and the democrats who view it as regressive he ought to lay it out before the people
1285863 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1285864 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1285865 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1285866 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1285867 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1285868 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1285869 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

1285871 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1285872 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1285873 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1285874 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china

1285889 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1285890 recent studies in botswana swaziland malawi zambia and tanzania have shown associations between acute food insecurity and unprotected transactional sex among poor women
1285891 we really need to watch this very carefully we are in a situation of rising oil prices rising food prices and at the same time the cost of aids is going up along with new infections
1285892 even though its a double decker and it looks like a whale its only modestly bigger than whats already out there

1285894 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1285895 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1285896 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1285897 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1285898 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1285899 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1285900 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1285901 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1285902 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1285903 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1285904 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1285905 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1285906 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1285907 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1285908 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1285909 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1285910 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1285911 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1285912 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1285913 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1285914 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1285915 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1285916 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1285917 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1285918 no strings relationships have helped cure me of love addiction
1285919 all my life ive been in long term monogamous relationships
1285920 i had to break that pattern by not allowing myself to have a relationship for a year stopping myself from committing to men
1285921 he had that ncaa issue and he got cleared im happy for both parties
1285922 joe wanted to show the loyalty to florida state and thats where he wanted to go from day one you would think he would want to go back to utah or california or somewhere like that but it sounded like this was his dream school
1285923 i had calls from everywhere kansas cal who offered and utah offered but nobody pursued it like florida state did to help him get his years back
1285924 all the top division two schools offered as well but obviously it worked out for him to go division one he was going to snow college in utah right out of high school and i guess they enrolled him as a full time student in the tongan culture you are really close to your family and when his uncle got real ill he had to go run the family business for a couple years thats where they petitioned it and they looked through the doctors notes and everything else or his clock would have started earlier
1285925 he was our starting left tackle and we ended up playing for the state championship this year out in the mission conference
1285926 hes a great role model a great leader and a great person i cant say enough about him i always tell everybody if he needed a place to stay i would let him stay with my family thats how i feel
1285927 mount sac isnt division one but he went against one of our guys that played at michigan eugene germany he went against him every day in practice and he germany ended up re signing with arizona state hes constantly going against that caliber of athlete as far as what ive heard left tackle is where they are looking at him
1285928 hes been working out a lot with one of his best friends who is a defensive end for seattle seahawks hes on the practice roster and they were working out every day
1285929 he will have to get used to the humidity but i think hell be fine

1285931 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan said ashutosh gowarikar on the sidelines of the world kids international film festival held in the capital recently but the perfectionist director has nothing concrete to offer the peter pan actor right away as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him
1285932 i am trying to do something different in the film which is a romantic comedy
1285933 i signed harman because he totally suits the character in
1285934 she is a good actor but i think she has lot more to offer i am trying to bring something special out of her in my next venture
1285935 this film is a challenge for me as it is very difficult to make a comedy but i like to face new challenges
1285936 i am a big fan of hrishida and basuda i love to watch jyoti swaroop directed padosan again and again thats my favourite comedy film

1285939 ten minutes of classical on hold music later i began to wonder if she
1285940 at the 30 minute mark i figured she certainly had but since i wasn
1285941 as owner of perth based on hold production company messages on hold i know a thing or two about being on hold but i challenge anyone to beat six hours plus on hold
1285942 its very emotional and a very powerful song not like anything that people are used to paul mccartney doing he added
1285943 we are moving away we are looking for a place where our children can grow up in peace
1285944 i have very high hopes of myself and i have high hopes of all my colleagues in the indian shooting team we have a very strong contingent and to an extent the expectation is justified
1285945 i don t think there is anything to be scared of pressure pressure keeps me a little bit on the edge and keeps me sharp so it works well for me and i want to do well
1285946 i am really looking forward to it i am peaking well at the moment i am feeling physically ready for it fingers crossed and a lot of hard work and we will be ready to go
1285947 i am the best i have to win a medal and i will try my best to win a medal it is my dream and the time has come to fulfill it
1285948 we want to show them we are sticking around that we are not going to be pushed around
1285949 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is about going for it
1285950 thats our approach its pedal to the metal thats what every move is based on or what every attempted move is based on with an eye toward the present and an eye toward the future but were going for it
1285951 it gives the team stability its a collision sport you dont know how long the careers are its a difficult sport to work in for players i appreciate that a lot of players hit unrestricted free agency they may have had a mediocre season the year before they might have had an injury but its tough out there the security of being a multimillionaire i think is appealing still to both the team and the players then youll have to adjust if there are significant changes ups or downs
1285952 you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out weve never not worked something out with brian and hopefully this will play itself out well
1285953 i think you forget sometimes how successful hes been and weve been
1285954 show us and the league that hes back to the old lito feels healthy that hes got great playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa yards per pass attempt against him and just really perform the way that we know lito can i think thats what hes going to do
1285955 it felt good real real good to be out there with the guys to test the waters out so to speak just to get back out there and sweat with the guys
1285956 he looks like the old dawk hes always taking care of his body in the hot tub getting massages and stretching hes doing all the little extra things that you think you can get away without doing when youre younger
1285957 you get an injury when you are a rookie and its because you have fatigued legs you get an injury when youre 35 the same exact injury and its because youre old same injury i had now is the same one i had about 6 years ago hyperextended knee its the same injury but because im 35 now its because im getting older
1285958 dawk is the kind of guy you can never count out
1285959 hes the guy who never says quit he looks real good to me the same now as he does during the season i feel more comfortable with him on the field than i do with anybody else
1285960 look im gonna go out and whatever i can give im gonna give
1285961 i anticipate being me i only know one way to play and thats full speed and thats how ill do it ive always done it that way and im gonna go out and give all i can to those guys on game day thats how im gonna do it
1285962 youre talking about the cornerstone of the defense and of this team
1285963 i dont want to think about when hes not here i look at him as a father figure as a guy i look up to i dont want to think about that right now if that comes well have to deal with it then but i dont want to think about that
1285964 injuries are such a key element today because with the contracts payrolls and overall lack of talent nobody has that much depth
1285965 probably most teams can piece it together if they lose one or two integral guys but if you get beyond that its tough
1285966 i think its just being very lucky i think things have to fall right for you
1285967 i think we were really unlucky last year to some extent
1285968 but we also made some changes that we think have helped weve tried to be proactive
1285969 if youre talking about something like what happened to jimmy rollins youre talking about luck his ankle caught when he was in a bad position thats an injury that cant be controlled
1285970 then there are some you might be able to predict maybe you have some guys in spring training and their shoulder is a little tighter than youd like thats kind of a crapshoot
1285971 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1285972 ive had more sleepless nights i guess its come back to haunt me for ever bragging about not being stressed out
1285973 i kind of put my pride aside before something really bad happens
1285974 i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1285975 the consequences are what they are im willing to accept them
1285976 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important it is a ton of money but at this time i dont feel like i can put a price tag on my mental state
1285977 as a guy who went through that early in my career taking the medication i certainly understand
1285978 prayer and having people around me that i knew cared about me
1285979 stop some of the bleeding start some of the healing process maybe a little bit
1285980 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1285981 i like how spongebob handles life he gets picked on all the time but hes still happy he doesnt get angry with people he just goes through life with a smile on his face
1285982 i know there are harsh people in this world but dang that made me feel low i do care what people think about me to an extent
1285983 has kind of turned into this monster right now i know everybodys not forgiving i feel like my teammates will be but everybodys entitled to their own opinion
1285984 if i made comments every time i heard a rumor ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you the media ask
1285985 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1285986 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1285987 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1285988 i dont know if im going to get a chance to lead the football team but youre going to have to pry the ball out of my fingers this year
1285989 you dont even have to ask the question this time
1285990 i aint guaranteeing nothing but weve got a good chance of going over there and bringing the gold medal back
1285991 since last year i have been contacted by a number of licensees asking about spikeys
1285992 whilst it would appear that the deliberate contamination of drinks is not widespread in bamber bridge we are supplying the spikeys for members of our community to use both here and when they travel further a field to places like preston blackpool and other larger towns and cities in the area

1286000 real estate is all about location location location the same house in new york city would go for 20 million minimum in beverly hills or some place like that in southern california its probably 40 million
1286001 ill be 44 in january and ive never taken a beating a real beating in the ring how many fighters my age or any age can say that
1286002 in my heart of hearts i believe the last time i lost was when i fought roy jones jr in 1993 some would say im in denial but there are thousands of people heck millions of people who believe i won both fights with jermain taylor and the one with joe calzaghe some judges might say otherwise but the public knows who the real winner of a fight is
1286003 i think people still want to see me and roy jones jr before we both head off to the retirement home
1286004 i was excited relieved i could start getting back on the court
1286005 this is a process where you cant really be on the court without a contract youve just got to wait it out i was excited to be able to stay here and at the same time get back to work
1286006 he was so anxious he didnt have what you could call a big outburst
1286007 it was more like an exhale it was a great process for him
1286008 we talk about upside with players and lous is as high as he wants to go

1286012 ive always been one of those type of guys where i always felt i was going to be an nba player and i always felt like i was going to put myself in a position to make a lot of money over my career
1286013 things dont just happen overnight were just in the middle of negotiations
1286014 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part

1286021 some people with bpd are competent and in control in some situations for example many perform very well at work and are high achievers many are very intelligent creative and artistic this can be very confusing for family members who dont understand why the person can act so assuredly in one situation and fall apart in another this ability to have competence in difficult situations while being incompetent in seemingly equal or easier tasks is known as situational competence by way of explanation one borderline woman says we know deep within that we are defective so we try so hard to act normal because we want so much to please everybody and keep the people in our lives from abandoning us but this competence is a double edged sword because they can appear so normal high functioning borderlines often dont get the help they need
1286022 some people with bpd frequently bring the focus of attention back to themselves
1286023 those that act out tend to function well in public they are doctors and managers lawyers and parents best friends and board members theyre politicians and teachers they are often fun to be around they may be ambitious successful professionally the life of the party sociable and great storytellers they may have a knack for putting others at ease once out of the public eye however they direct their negative emotion at others usually family members pointing an accusatory finger making impossible demand and inflicting verbal emotional and sometimes physical abuse on loved ones some adult children recall being told as adolescents that they were ugly unpopular and wouldnt amount to anything for example from outward appearances the person with bpd may seem the model of competence and normalcy others with bpd act in tending instead to turn negative emotion inward resulting in self destructive behaviors such as cutting self mutilation abusing alcohol or drugs feeling intensely guilty for circumstances and events beyond their control setting unreasonable high standards for themselves or attempting suicide they tend to be heavy utilizers of the mental health and health care systems and may have difficulty keeping a permanent job

1286033 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1286034 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1286035 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

1286057 this step is a result of sebs own ambition to raise our standards in the area of responsible investments as well as of increasing demands from institutional clients
1286058 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1286059 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1286060 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1286061 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1286062 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1286063 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1286064 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1286065 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1286066 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1286067 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1286068 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1286069 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1286070 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1286071 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1286072 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1286073 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1286074 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1286075 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1286076 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

1286078 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1286079 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1286080 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1286081 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1286082 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1286083 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1286084 we informed the defence and the court this morning the next hearing has been set for september when this will be discussed
1286085 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here
1286086 hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids
1286087 after i looked again at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion that i had to make a choice because of the necessary physical effort to achieve the maximum at this level
1286088 playing at emirates stadium and giving all my heart to arsenal makes me feel very happy
1286089 ive been able to see in the last few weeks the passion that surrounds the club its a family
1286090 im delighted and hopeful this will be a good season ive been able to get to know my team mates during the preparation
1286091 besides i love the way arsenal play and the team spirit as well all the young players appreciate each other and you can feel it on the pitch
1286092 youre just scamming me you dont want to help me
1286093 jen i want to help you and i will but i have to take care of this first i have no choice
1286094 why should you support him in this he was naked with her he held her and loved her slowly and rapidly and passionately who are you supposed to be

1286097 he wants the child she is carrying the one you could never have because god lied to you

1286104 the net sales we attained during the first half of this year grew by almost 5 compared to the same period last year even though the growth was substantially slowed down by the exit of calcimagon from the german portfolio and the weakening of the us dollar rate the groups operating profit improved as well regardless of the planned increase in expenditure on research and sales as well as the costs caused by the ongoing patent infringement lawsuits in the usa
1286105 our estimate of the groups outlook for the full year 2008 remains unchanged compared to the previously published one in the 2007 financial statements and q1 2008 interim report the entire outlook estimate and the related preamble are found on page 5 of this report
1286106 orion has continued to strengthen its product portfolio by entering into new in licensing agreements that often cover broader geographical marketing rights than in the past this enables us to expand our operations in europe step by step in accordance with our strategy these new products must however undergo a marketing approval process and often also some product development before entering the markets therefore the increase in net sales as a result of these new agreements will take some time
1286107 our expenditure on research continues as planned it was clearly a disappointment to discontinue the development of the new comt inhibitor nevertheless we have several other promising projects on going to which the released resources will be directed

1286110 were pleased to lead the way in adopting deviceatlas as our standard for mobile content development
1286111 dotmobis deviceatlas is unique in that it ties together the mobile content operator and handset communities and lets us create the kind of specialized content that continues to differentiate msn in the market
1286112 since implementing deviceatlas and launching our mobi site weve seen an increase in registrations interestingly customers are coming from all over the world i think that shows the power of the mobi domain in marketing a brand
1286113 deviceatlas continues to grow by the day in the number of phones and attributes that are available to developers were excited that microsoft and morodo have seen the benefits of deviceatlas in helping to resolve the issues inherent in the heterogeneous nature of the mobile handset industry

1286115 canadian olympic fans had better rest up because a marathon of tv newspaper radio and internet observations are just about to kick into high gear
1286116 with a record number of hours on tv and more than 20 000 accredited media from around the world the beijing olympics will supply an unprecedented amount of coverage of the games
1286117 these feelings are strong in a multicultural country like our own where many are separated from their native homelands
1286118 one can expect a rollercoaster of emotions of high peaks and deep valleys during events and over the course of the games
1286119 days are very long during the olympics as coach athlete commentator and as a spectator
1286120 but while those at home have the luxury of turning on the tv and getting live action from all dozen venues that day moving around an olympic city can be a competition in endurance all by itself
1286121 continuously remind oneself that as a fan whats taking place on tv or a hockey rink soccer pitch or baseball field for that matter is beyond your control
1286122 each one has sacrificed tremendously to put on the maple leaf uniform at the games
1286123 weve dominated this race twice now and not closed the deal
1286124 im bitterly disappointed and i feel a little robbed it doesnt feel too good
1286125 if i did speed in pit lane i just couldnt see a thing there so when i saw the flashing lights at the end of pit lane i just went
1286126 its just heart wrenching for stp kingsford and clorox our whole jtg daugherty racing team and all the fans and friends back in australia
1286127 i just feel like we are jinxed at the moment because we have come so close but still havent got a win
1286128 ill take it if we were speeding in pit lane but its just so disappointing because we had this race
1286129 we obviously had the best car for these track conditions
1286130 we were in position to be leading again once everybody pitted obviously the race got called short im not sure the how sound the thought process was between at what point in time is it raceable or not raceable thats all new to nascar its new to everybody but at least in our case its pretty unfortunate the way those decisions went down and we ended up finishing third instead of winning
1286131 i feel like montreal owes us yeah weve been in position to win and had the best car twice and couldnt close the deal theres always next year
1286132 im bitterly disappointed i feel like we really dominated todays race i made an error down pit lane i just couldnt see the pit exit and we sped i went down and had a look at it and its still hard to see im just really disappointed i feel like the race was ours today and i tripped over myself im real sorry for my team and stp and jtg daugherty racing for i let them down i guess its a shame
1286133 obviously i had no grip but better than everyone else because we did pretty well it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job
1286134 im bitterly disappointed that i let everybody down with that
1286135 i feel like i need to win a race ive come here twice dominated and came up short both times so im gonna have to have a few beers or something to reconcile myself tonight and hopefully ill wake up tomorrow with a hangover and feel a little better right now i feel very disappointed and hopefully that goes away
1286136 if the race kept going or the rain had stopped they couldnt keep the race going it was too wet i commend nascar for making the call to stop that race because it was getting dangerous out there we had a lot of car whether patrick carpentier and the 5 ron fellows had to stop one more time if they didnt we would race them hard to the end we still feel like were in a good position but i really let them down i guess i could be mad at nascar but im not im mad at myself for making a mistake its hard to see that cone i guess a lot of guys got penalized for doing the same thing but its just the way it goes
1286137 ive learned that i dont want to race in the rain in a nascar again its really tricky maybe if there is inclement weather again down the road nascar wont be so frightened to put us out there on wets because we got a race in everyone was safe and it was a decent show i guess the tires held up and the cars held up i thought for sure we were going to have electrical problems with all the water that was coming in the car but anything that got wet was me
1286138 i feel jinxed full stop ive come along way to be part of nascar and im two and a half years into this deal and havent gotten a victory ive got second third fourth fifth whatever but that win has alluded me i guess if you keep knocking on the door it will come
1286139 im disappointed but life goes on ive got two healthy girls back home im looking forward to getting home and seeing those girls tonight and play in the sandbox tomorrow and have a swim and forget about life

1286152 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1286153 you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1286154 bernie mac is still alive and being treated in a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery he is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
1286155 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1286156 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1286157 violence both verbal and otherwise is a huge workplace issue and that makes me wonder why do we need to manufacture a bogus trend like
1286158 as soon as someone knows they have an explosion waiting to happen they need to call in human resources the price of waiting is losing valuable employees or getting a lawsuit on their hands
1286159 often those acting out dont even realize what theyre doing
1286160 it isnt until their group has had a large turnover that many managers begin to take note by then its too late depending on the employees level of responsibility the recruitment costs to replace them may be two to three times their annual salary and seriously affect an organizations bottom line
1286161 whether its desk rage or just rudeness at work ive noticed it increase during my time in the workplace
1286162 and even had someone rip a closet door off in my office ive learned the most important thing in dealing with someone whos angry is to stay calm yourself this gives you a better chance of having them listen to you
1286163 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1286164 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1286165 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1286166 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1286167 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1286168 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1286169 not yet sure which way were going but we have the legal right to appeal the decision to the supreme court of maine or file a motion for reconsideration of the commissions action we also have the right to sue cmp on land use and easement issues
1286170 i decided long ago never to walk in anyones shadows if i fail if i succeed at least i live as i believe no matter what they take from me they cant take away my dignity because the greatest love of all

1286172 willow creek had been doing this conference for about 12 years and about eight years ago started adding satellites
1286173 they used to have it in chicago but could only fit 4 000 people we were chosen because we were willing to do it it involves some work on our part and some expense willow wants every site to have the same experience so we must set up with a willow creek conference atmosphere
1286174 because the screen is so large you feel like youre right there if we were in chicago the seats would be in an auditorium many find the smaller setting to be more beneficial
1286175 the cost for the summit is about 250 but as a host site our people only pay 75
1286176 seeking 30 yo woman from winchendon ma went to badfish at hampton
1286177 how can i met a woman if i dont drink
1286178 im very much at a quandary of what to do
1286179 theres a lot going into it and its expensive i think its good for teachers and at some point it could be good for the city
1286180 i believe a budget is something that is supposed to be achieved
1286181 it sets a precedent for the rest of the contracts going forward its rather unfair to the public
1286182 i think it drives us in the direction of incentive rather than seniority and i think that takes a lot of courage
1286183 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
1286184 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all
1286185 if kids dont have the information lets get it to them
1286186 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1286187 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
1286188 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
1286189 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
1286190 its very clear we want a quality school but we dont want to spend peoples hard earned money in a poor way so it is important to maximize the space in the school
1286191 within that discussion needs to be consideration of programs needed as well as cost and utilization of the area
1286192 little legislative victories part of the day to day work that we do
1286193 these are depression era visuals that have no place in our country
1286194 when we leave iraq a lot of iraqis will have good feelings about our troops
1286195 we have to have someone who knows history and listens to the state department
1286196 im very proud of what the new hampshire legislature has done in working with gov lynch in addressing long neglected needs of our state
1286197 the public realm in that area in stratham has become just big plazas and parking lots
1286198 the envisioned project is designed to make people stop and linger it will make people want to be there
1286199 were just laying it out and saying if they want to develop the area this is what we want it to look like
1286200 were creating the ability for developers to do it but we need them to build it
1286201 all our committee can do or wants to do is to make what we have better
1286202 if we have to force people to follow the plan then we dont have a very good plan
1286203 the current zoning has dictated that what they can build they have built
1286204 we have zoning that calls for one leveled structures behind a sea of asphalt
1286205 the sooner you get the requests in the more likely youll be to get a ticket
1286206 the art of nancy cooper funk nature pets scenes of the kennebunks
1286207 i thought we were the only one but i learned there is one in florida
1286208 well go from being able to house 24 animals to about 60 and well now have an overnight room the people can stay with their pets they used to sit on the floor in front of the cage we wont have to turn anyone away not that we would wed find room but this will be less stressful for the pets
1286209 wed have teens come in to feed and brush a specific animal
1286210 the experience of having someone care just for them that contact tends to improve the animals recovery time
1286211 i have no confidence that you will do what you say you will because you havent yet
1286212 i dont think you are being prudent or fair to the town when weve let you operate for 2 years without a certificate of occupancy
1286213 i feel like things have been blatantly overlooked until we take drastic steps to have you come in here
1286214 its a shame that the parking issues werent addressed beforehand
1286215 with all of your experience why wasnt parking addressed from the get go
1286216 we have the events and then word of mouth gets around and more people come the next time
1286217 and we have people who play in one match and stay to watch the other matches
1286218 what will destroy us is if we cant do something on one side of the road for certain events
1286219 if we cannot have a select few events then we will not survive
1286220 its just that a lot has been overlooked and set aside and we want this done and done right
1286221 my second daughter was born in china and we adopted her at 13 months
1286222 its such an easy fix for us and these kids will succeed
1286223 they have already proven it and we can remove their one last hurdle most of their parents are illiterate they will be able to help their kids do homework
1286224 now i have become a student at this school every morning in order to get better grades i get up early and stay up until midnight fortunately i got your help it made me find my confidence again i will remember you forever
1286225 they forced open the front door went inside and stole alcohol
1286226 the alarm came in we were there within three minutes and they were gone
1286227 if anybody knows or sees him give us a call
1286228 theyve had them before and they either expire or dont get renewed by the judge
1286229 this is a long ongoing property dispute between the two and it has been in the courts for a long time
1286230 the york police have had to respond to this location many times
1286231 the defendant did strike mr eaton causing him to suffer an injury
1286232 each of our teams home arenas are great facilities for a league at this level
1286233 a highlight of the ephl schedule is that 84 percent of our league games will be played either on weekends or on holiday dates
1286234 weve asked guys when they stop to do the paperwork shut off the engines
1286235 they have more of everything if it is supposed to be comparable to newmarket to compare us to them i dont think we should be doing it
1286236 i think taking dover and rochester out is not a good idea we can compare back to the 2005 study
1286237 there werent any real tees there were mats at each hole
1286238 its a good walking course there are not a lot of hills i just enjoy playing and the camaraderie with the other golfers
1286239 i remember at 4 30 a m at 13 or 14 years of age whipping the greens with a 25 foot bamboo pole clearing the moisture off the greens golf course maintenance is like shaving it keeps coming back and its very repetitive
1286240 is probably one of the best kept secrets on the seacoast
1286241 the heart and soul of a golf course is its superintendent the person who cares for the course
1286242 it was everyone coming together from the u s and canada having fun and being athletes
1286243 we are now past the primary and we want the office to be known as part of the community campaign
1286244 this office being where it is its where the people are we want this office to be open so people can stop in and say what can i do and feel they are a part of this campaign and play a role in this election
1286245 our country is on the edge we are falling of a cliff
1286246 the party has had control of the house and senate and weve seen great progress
1286247 its a different campaign not only the ballot design but the issues that are important in this campaign
1286248 to me this means that something very important is happening in our area traditionally we respond to families in need during thanksgiving and christmas now we are responding earlier
1286249 families are making choices between putting gas in their car paying their mortgage and buying groceries
1286250 barack obama certainly charged up younger voters during the primary we are hoping to catch some of those people and turn them into regular voters
1286251 looking at the two presidential campaigns its really an optimistic versus a pessimistic attitude
1286252 its not about what happened in the past its about how we can move forward for all people
1286253 preserve as much of the natural beauty as we can
1286254 one day the traffic was backed up almost to scotland bridge road
1286255 people are creatures of habit and they drive sometimes without paying attention
1286256 the public has really responded favorably to having the lights there
1286257 as long as bush has been here theres been a reason to march
1286258 were all politically active in this area if there is a just cause that we believe in then were there
1286259 its america if we didnt have protesters it just makes sense
1286260 the sandbar could look innocent out there and people say its a nice sandbar so lets walk out on it
1286261 i think the people who know what the fire department needs are already here on the inside
1286262 we just put all of what we need in the back of a van and go
1286263 i was in the insurance business for 20 years and basically felt called to come here
1286264 we have some people out on vacation right now so it will be an even smaller turnout than usual
1286265 25 is extremely good but theyre not in this on sunday morning to make money
1286266 if he wants us to have a place then we will
1286267 the church prayed and voted to join up with what oliver had going on here
1286268 were looking for land in stratham but its just unbelievably expensive
1286269 i recently graduated from a small high school where the resources were limited
1286270 i left feeling almost unprepared for college due to lack of experience particularly with laboratory equipment
1286271 i plan on attending boston university in the fall majoring in biology and the bioconnectnh program allowed for me to gain knowledge with top of the line equipment giving me the leverage i needed in order to compete in my classes it boosted my confidence in completing laboratory experiments and gave me the hands on experience i was in need of
1286272 dont think you are alone as rotarians who want to do something
1286273 there are a lot of people who want to help with this issue its an emotional issue that tugs at your heartstrings
1286274 we are hoping this triggers some things in your local community how you may be able to tackle these issues
1286275 id like to get started get the issue noticed and then start working with the town to do some things
1286276 those things we deal with on a regular basis if we could work in conjunction with rotary to come up with something absolutely
1286277 hed go up there to work even when he was not being paid for it
1286278 donate to the parks and the rest to the pancreatic cancer
1286279 hes probably coached all the kids in town he just absolutely loved sports in seabrook loved the kids
1286280 he loved baseball he blew up all the fireworks in the neighborhood when the red sox won
1286281 i have made my view on this clear and now i am just looking forward to the new season with vfb
1286282 the european championships is a long time ago as far back as the league title in 2007
1286283 i am not wasting any thoughts on that i am in stuttgart and happy here that is it
1286284 i am convinced that we can play better this season
1286285 winning the league may not be our aim but then who knows what will happen two years ago we didnt speak of the title either
1286286 there are teams with bigger stars than us but we are a very good team
1286287 i think it is very important the players here themselves set their agenda for the year and what they wanted to achieve and aim for
1286288 one of them was to get to the final of the pre season cup because they want to start this season ready to go from the first league game
1286289 its not good for the hamstring when you are in a stationary sitting position for a long period
1286290 its best that he gets himself right and he can train twice a day while he is back in melbourne
1286291 on constate que se forment deux groupes de zones bien distinctes en mati re de d pendance lhertzien analogique la facade est de la france appara t tr s nettement comme la zone la moins d pendante de lhertzien analogique car ces zones ont une forte p n tration de c ble satellite et adsl a linverse les fa ades ouest et sud de la manche de latlantique des pyr n es et de la m diterran e sont tr s en retard

1286293 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its eight feet underneath
1286294 it basically was straddling this support beam its legs dangling
1286295 because it fell in the corner we had to take part of the stall wall apart
1286296 somewhere along the line the vet showed up and gave it a sedative so it wouldnt hurt itself
1286297 we pushed it up enough to get a plank under its butt
1286298 hunderttausende engagierte b rger haben unser angebot in den ersten wochen genutzt haben diskutiert und ihre erfahrungen im kampf gegen rechtsextremismus ausgetauscht das hat uns und unseren partnern mut gemacht das projekt fortzuf hren

1286300 allein vespers vergleich verbietet sich schon wir sprechen hier doch nicht ber internetseiten mit strafrechtlich relevanten inhalten wir sprechen ber amnesty international
1286301 ich finde es schade dass das ioc so seicht reagiert die w rden am liebsten die f e unterm tisch halten
1286302 in jedem land der welt auch in der bundesrepublik deutschland werden internetseiten gesperrt bei uns sind es rechtsradikale seiten die gesperrt werden und es ist nat rlich auch in china so dass einzelne seiten gesperrt werden
1286303 die argumentation der chinesischen staatsf hrung das ist teils eins zu eins chinesische staatspropaganda
1286304 this is the first significant effort in 30 or 40 years to engage social sciences on a large scale by the department of defense
1286305 deeply concerned that funding such research through the pentagon may pose a potential conflict of interest
1286306 it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
1286307 they are concerned i might be some kind of intelligence agent
1286308 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1286309 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1286310 his voice was clear even though marco starts feeling pain at his lower limbs
1286311 anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1286312 the armys pilots are still waiting for an improvement in the weather conditions and the moment they were allowed to fly they will pick up the italian mountaineer
1286313 high beer taxes threaten to prevent many low and moderate earners enjoying a regular pint at their local pub
1286314 we desperately urge the chancellor to think again before he goes down in history as the chancellor who closed thousands of community pubs damaged community life and prevented many millions of pub goers from enjoying a regular trip to the pub
1286315 romania a cerut ajutorul ue pentru inundatiile care au avut loc si a trimis o lista in care a inventariat toate echipamentele necesare centrului de monitorizare si informare n
1286316 in aceasta faza nu vorbim si despre un ajutor financiar pentru ca noi nu alocam fonduri in aceasta situatie mai tarziu daca evaluarile vor demonstra ca inundatiile au produs un dezastru major cu un mare impact economic care sa afecteze 1 5 din pib se poate face o solicitare de fonduri
1286317 danemarca a trimis o echipa cehia si slovacia care au ajuns luni in romania ei sunt acolo sa ajute vor face exact ceea ce le cer cei de la protectia civila din romania si vor discuta despre solutii pentru prevenirea inundatiilor in viitor
1286318 scopul nostru este sa prevenim dezastrele si efectele asupra mediului
1286319 everyone was enthralled by the story of how ians parents met a story that ian had only just heard never guessing the romantic and adventurous beginnings of his parents relationship the resonance of that story together with the ideas ian explored in the master class had the makings of a very exciting piece of theatre that sang out for further development
1286320 fortunately we have been able to bring together some of our finest practitioners to work with ian on this project over the last 18 months this is a multi disciplinary creative collaboration that blends the time honoured art of storytelling with cutting edge animation and original music
1286321 every family has its own story to tell about migrating to new zealand by touring ship songs to theatres across auckland were enabling people to access a local story at a local venue
1286322 deshalb freue ich mich und habe ein schmunzeln im gesicht wenn jetzt auch einmal auf der parteirechten ein exempel statuiert wird denen wird nun auch mal gesagt dass sie nicht die narrenfreiheit haben dass ihr tun und handeln nicht ohne konsequenzen bleibt

1286339 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
1286340 depois de termos um presidente que esteve no bolso das grandes companhias de petr leo n o podemos mais ter um outro
1286341 o recente ataque de barack obama mostra que sua celebridade s comparada sua hipocrisia
1286342 romper com o nosso v cio pelo petr leo um dos grandes desafios que nossa gera o jamais ir enfrentar
1286343 n o vai precisar de nada mais do que uma completa transforma o de nossa economia
1286344 o governador nos tranq ilizou e garantiu que o contrato ser assinado esta semana cabral descartou a possibilidade da perda de 4 mil postos de trabalho na cidade segundo ele o governo do estado trabalha para desenvolver a ind stria naval do estado e principalmente em niter i que det m 80 do setor no pa s
1286345 estamos unindo esfor os para que parte desses navios fiquem no estado mas ainda n o temos nada definido
1286346 como a p 62 um clone da p 54 o mau tem respaldo legal para construir a plataforma sem a necessidade de licita o tivemos a informa o que a petrobras est fazendo alguns reajustes no projeto para liberar o recurso por enquanto os estaleiros ainda n o dispensaram os funcion rios mas caso haja atraso na constru o dos petroleiros e da p 62 ser inevit vel j que os estaleiros dependem dos contratos para permanecer com seus quadros de funcion rios como tamb m para contratar outros
1286347 qu prefiero el n mero uno ya lo tengo asegurado mi objetivo es hacer un buen papel aqu en pek n y una vez que pase esto mi pretensi n es acabar como n mero uno
1286348 el n mero uno es importante pero m s es ganar wimbledon por ejemplo
1286349 para nosotros los tenistas los juegos ol mpicos son importantes tras los torneos del grand slam es lo m s importante del a o los grand slam est n un poco por encima pero despu s lo m s importante junto a la copa davis o la copa masters de shangai
1286350 soy un candidato m s pero no m s que los dem s lo importante es adaptarse pronto llevo muchos partidos encima y espero tener tiempo para adaptarme
1286351 novak djokovic o roger federer son los favoritos porque la pista se les da mejor despu s estamos el resto
1286352 en la villa ol mpica estamos muy bien es una experiencia muy distinta a la que estamos habituados vas conociendo al resto de deportistas la acogida ha sido muy buena todos se han portado muy bien con nosotros
1286353 no creo que el recibimiento fuera de n mero uno llevo a os ah arriba puede ser m s por ganar wimbledon o roland garros el n mero uno es m s importante pero m s ganar wimbledon
1286354 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1286355 the rebates are not translating into anywhere near the spending impulse that congress and the administration had hoped for
1286356 under these circumstances the economy remains in very fragile condition
1286357 he left austins three children in the burning house when he fled
1286358 when i looked around i saw families enjoying the exhibits

1286360 indian filmmakers really are trying to break out of the old visual cliches of bollywood
1286361 its a different visual than the indian audience is used to
1286362 this coast is the furthest from india that any place can be
1286363 indian films are going global because we now have the budget
1286364 the locality reflects the dreams of the people in mumbai
1286365 when they see the golden gate bridge or the bay bridge in a photo they envy that they wish they were here
1286366 im concerned that if he returns he will continue in the actions that bring us here today
1286367 he is not a threat and he is not a flight risk
1286368 we can take credit for the shoe leather police work that was involved
1286369 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1286370 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1286371 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1286372 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1286373 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1286374 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives
1286375 doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of americans
1286376 i am willing to come back off the campaign trail
1286377 were still trying to sort out what happened obviously there was a disagreement of some kind
1286378 what the motive was that prompted the stabbing is unclear but the detectives are still following up leads and interviewing witnesses
1286379 over the next few days we will be working with osha to find out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1286380 we will be selling 800 000 volkswagens in the u s by 2018

1286382 irans written response to the six countries involved in the nuclear negotiations was handed to officials at the european union by irans ambassador to brussels
1286383 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1286384 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1286385 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
1286386 like i said at the sentencing if he put his ingenuity to good use mr nhin would be a successful person
1286387 keeping track of who did what with what car all the different vietnamese names and similar kinds of cars it was very difficult to sort out
1286388 hell just be a little tropical storm tyke compared to big mamas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1286389 theyre so talented they can play anywhere and do a good job
1286390 all we can do as coaches is discuss with the relevant players their strengths and weaknesses and advise them where we think they must play
1286391 but they must take the responsibility and make that decision themselves
1286392 ruan must go back to the sharks and have a chat with his coach john plumtree and make the choice where he wants to play then we can take it from there
1286393 we had the luxury of carrying these guys on tour but its no use they carry tackle bags around while in south africa
1286394 if we need them we can call them up at any time itss in their and our best interests that they go and play rugby so when they do come back theyre fit and ready to go we know what attributes they can bring to the team right now theyre in desperate need of game time
1286395 at locke 1 000 ninth graders were enrolled in 2001
1286396 of the 240 who graduated four years later only 30 were eligible to apply to a california state campus
1286397 teach for america recruits cant close the achievement gap but its alumni might
1286398 inhaber von urheberrechten sollten sich der tatsache bewusst sein dass sich die tauschb rsen hartn ckig halten sie sind unglaublich beliebt
1286399 es ist an der zeit nicht mehr gegen den strom der kundenw nsche zu schwimmen
1286400 unsere sucht nach l zu durchbrechen ist eine der gr ten herausforderungen der unsere generation je gegen berstehen wird
1286401 what would you like to start with fast or slow
1286402 its upbeat for them to have that distraction in their day is tremendous
1286403 he cant go out and get stimulation so i bring the stimulation to him
1286404 the parents said its like the music woke her up it really elevated her
1286405 it was about a little girl with no hair going to get some hair at the wig shop and then she went to the park and felt the sun on her face
1286406 for a moment shes a little girl with hair swinging on the swings at the park and having fun
1286407 shes inside there she needs a memory or a thought to help her connect with whats going on around her
1286408 it was a dramatic struggle to even pass the classes
1286409 i had to really work hard at learning to sing learning to play and even developing my musical ear its been uphill
1286410 deep down i knew this is what i was supposed to be doing
1286411 it was a feeling a calling it was like a question was answered that i never knew i had to ask i love music and i saw the powerful benefits of it and i love working with people and serving and giving
1286412 for him he just liked the song he never really listened to the lyrics
1286413 it was a positive memory of driving in the truck with his dad just because a child asks for a dark song doesnt mean theyre having an emotionally dark experience
1286414 in cities where we have a border patrol presence the people know us and we have a positive image
1286415 but when you get into a city like indianapolis we dont have a visible presence and what theyve heard about the border patrol may not be all positive our first goal was to educate the public and inject ourselves into that market
1286416 we solicited feedback from outside groups who gave us their perceptions about the agency
1286417 we wanted to understand what those perceptions were and then match our message up against those perceptions so we werent creating materials in isolation
1286418 if you dont meet the numbers the same thing will happen to you in this job as would happen to you in any job
1286419 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1286420 weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate
1286421 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1286422 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1286423 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase
1286424 studies like ours that establish when and how climate thresholds were crossed along the way can be used to predict climate thresholds going the opposite direction from cool to warm
1286425 although to be fair were looking at one that is very far away warming would have to be greater than what is predicted for the next one or two centuries to cause a melting of the east antarctic ice sheet the west antarctic ice sheet is much more vulnerable
1286426 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1286427 the fdas current standards for sunscreen testing and labeling leave americans with a false sense of security about whether their sunscreen protects them from harmful uva rays while the fda has proposed to improve their testing and labeling rules they have done nothing to make those rules final and enforceable
1286428 we are working as expeditiously as possible for the public
1286429 many sunscreen products carry claims that they protect against cancer causing uva rays but without fda action to set standards for testing and labeling these claims cant be validated
1286430 it was really rewarding to hear that justice was done
1286431 his family was mad dogging us as we were walking out
1286432 you could tell they were gangsters even though they covered up and looked nice it was scary

1286434 the aleutian islands are home to natural resources found nowhere else in the world and the regional economy is dominated by commercial fishing

1286459 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1286460 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1286461 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1286462 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1286463 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1286464 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1286474 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1286475 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

1286480 they dont want them to be mimicked they want to have special achievements in their version so thats one thing theyre pushing on that and theyre saying that if youre developing something on ps3 we want you to have exclusives for us
1286481 im sure there will probably be some that overlap just because there are some fun achievements that you want to do on both but yeah its a different system too theres like gold silver platinum type trophies too so theres going to be top level achievements i guess you have that on xbox too with 60 point ones as opposed to 20 point ones yeah therell definitely be different achievements for both
1286482 i didnt grow up in the kind of environment that my characters grew up in or the kind of environment that i live in now
1286483 it was one of the things that i always aspired to
1286484 there are always going to be these categories that people will try to use to describe me but i should not be put into a box
1286485 i would listen to their vernacular watch what they did
1286486 if you were african american and you were gay you kept your mouth shut and you went on and did what everybody else did
1286487 you had girlfriends you lived a life that your parents had dreamed for you

1286489 i wasnt comfortable talking about it i would say that this is a work of fiction

1286502 i just felt like i had to try to help them in some way
1286503 is that most of the children came to us as opposed to us searching for them
1286504 a lot of people wanted him until they found out his diagnosis
1286505 which leads us to believe that something is still in there that we can tap into
1286506 i decided that maybe we can just handle this locally and do a community give back project
1286507 i just felt like i had to try to help them in some way
1286508 is that most of the children came to us as opposed to us searching for them
1286509 a lot of people wanted him until they found out his diagnosis
1286510 which leads us to believe that something is still in there that we can tap into
1286511 i decided that maybe we can just handle this locally and do a community give back project
1286512 i know dejan he is a great player and a good lad he would be good for us but its not for me to decide
1286513 we went to see him and he was sat there with a smile on his face he said if its got to be then its got to be it sounds a bit daft to me but i suppose you have got to abide by the ruling everyone is just so gutted for the lad
1286514 i was quite close to rudi because he was injured at the same time as me and over the last year when i have seen him train hes looked a decent player
1286515 he said something about maybe going to scandinavia for six months to train and play
1286516 it is with mixed emotions that i am leaving molineux after seven enjoyable years with wolverhampton wanderers
1286517 but the opportunity to return to blackburn rovers one of my former clubs was too great to resist
1286518 i had some great times there and still have friends in the area and there are also people at the club that i know both newly appointed and those who have been there since my playing days with them that will hopefully make the move a smooth one
1286519 we havent got that zip yet we are down to one forward and that is alan smith we have strikers coming back so viduka is the only one who will miss the start martins should be ok for saturday but we have always known mark would be out
1286520 michael will be back with us soon but it will take some work to get him fit
1286521 it is too early to say what the extent of the injury is
1286522 steve is an excellent coach and im delighted hell be working with the first team
1286523 hes passed his uefa pro licence as have david parnaby and martin scott
1286524 im gutted its not a good thing that before the season starts you find out youre not going to be part of it but in the end you just have to move on
1286525 i will keep training and working hard with my rehabilitation because im still contracted to the club and hopefully i can recover and get through this
1286526 sir alex is determined he will not let ronaldo go now if only on principle
1286527 and ronaldo will miss the start of the season in any case through injury
1286528 one solution being looked at is for ronaldo to stay one more season with the guarantee he can go for an agreed fee at the end of next season
1286529 i think stephen is a bit disappointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll
1286530 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1286531 its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1286532 if you miss you give other guys opportunities thats what you do
1286533 so the other guy is getting an opportunity to play and hes doing a good job with it
1286534 moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1286535 in a much weakened environment in terms of both debt markets and share valuations our differentiated investment strategy based on sector specialisation and fast growing companies is a major strength in attaining over the medium term the business objectives targeted by altamir amboise
1286536 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1286537 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1286538 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed
1286539 small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1286540 the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1286541 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1286542 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1286543 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1286544 a woman comes out on the fire escape to smoke a cigarette nearby theres a judas tree its seen better days and bears little foliage now only on the highest branches the woman stands and talks on her mobile shes unaware that on the other side of the tree theres movement and two eyes appear at a hole
1286545 still this survival is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
1286546 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown

1286548 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
1286549 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
1286550 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1286551 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1286552 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1286553 we were so shocked when we saw what the trawls of fishing boats have done to the vessel we could see the traces they have left
1286554 neither tottenham hotspur nor aston villa want to lose their best players certainly not to the superpowers whose coat tails they are trying to cling to but whether they like to admit it or not and to judge from their reactions this summer they obviously dont both clubs know a good deal when they see one
1286555 similarly hotspur stands to gain 30 million through the expected sale of dimitar berbatov to manchester united not a sum to be sniffed at given that they only paid 10 9 million for the player
1286556 it is a desperate attempt to fool supporters into thinking that they put up a fight to keep the players that they are big enough to withstand the advances of the premier league bullies and that only the twisted lengths to which united and liverpool are prepared to go to get their man helped them in the end
1286557 but there is something deeply unedifying about the way in which they have attempted to portray liverpool and united as guilty parties when all the indications behind the scenes have been of two clubs prepared if not necessarily happy to strike a deal at the right price
1286558 has stepped up his search for a new striker with blackburns roque santa cruz his next target if he fails to land dimitar berbatov
1286559 this alternative would be a reforming cabinet which will continue the reforms started in 2001 many of which were ceased
1286560 the draft law on the common parts of residential buildings tries to address a number of practical issues to resolve conflict situations

1286562 if it is proven that he the father superior started the fire he would be expelled from the religious order and would cease to be a priest

1286634 m any if not most of the jade products on the general market in china are from the abuse ridden jadeite industry in burma and profit burmas brutal military regime
1286635 beauty is in the eye of the beholder but how can burmas blood jade retain its beauty in our eyes when we know what has gone into it and that jade profits are propping up probably even arming the junta

1286638 we believe there are a variety of souvenirs on the market such as carvings and statues expensive jewelry made of burmese jade is also ubiquitous in china
1286639 people should boycott burmas blood jade just like they have conscientiously chosen not to buy conflict diamonds from places like sierra leone angola and the drc

1286641 nothing speaks louder of the governments poor faith than the fact that there are more long standing political prisoners in myanmar burma now than at any other time since those protests

1286643 both of them gambari and quintana should meet political prisoners and student leaders openly and freely
1286644 they the two envoys should not allow themselves to be used

1286722 it felt a bit weird doing it but being in the advertising industry i believe online video resumes can really help me when applying for a job
1286723 employers receive such a large number of applications that one needs to grab the attention of the potential employer quickly and that is exactly what online video resumes do
1286724 in recruiting personality and chemistry are very important if candidates presents well in an online video resume the employer will be more likely to offer an interview even if they for example lack the preferred work experience a written resume rarely provides that opportunity
1286725 the recruiting world is always evolving and videos help candidates understand our company culture and what separates us from the competition so they can tell if we would be a good fit for them
1286726 videos have that wow factor that regular ads dont have and unlike print ads online viewer ship can be tracked

1286737 online study tools are a new resource that todays wired students can take advantage of that past generations didnt have access to
1286738 were finding that students are increasingly using online study tools in tandem with their textbooks
1286739 first semester students can do some relatively simple things to get ahead in the study game such as taking freestyle notes during class and then editing them into outline form later honing in on key points and weeding out less important information early on makes studying easier down the road
1286740 in my 15 years of teaching ive found that good study habits are inevitably linked to better academic performance this is as true for freshman as it is for returning students
1286741 to no ones surprise only 12 percent of college students said they prefer to study in the early morning which just goes to show that students really are not morning people

1286745 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1286746 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1286747 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1286748 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl expletive him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1286749 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things some things im embarrassed to talk about
1286750 but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1286751 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1286752 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1286753 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse
1286754 some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1286755 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1286756 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1286757 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1286758 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont say everything is ok if it isnt
1286759 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1286760 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1286761 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1286762 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally
1286763 i think that was just part of me trying to identify myself
1286764 ive always felt like i was different i feel like im an abstract person and i still wonder who shawn andrews is thats why you always see me joking around being around people and singing activates my fun side
1286765 at the end of the day this doesnt take away from my fun side but it has for the time being

1286767 the worst set of macroeconomic conditions since the great depression
1286768 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1286769 ive had more sleepless nights i guess its come back to haunt me for ever bragging about not being stressed out
1286770 i kind of put my pride aside before something really bad happens
1286771 i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1286772 the consequences are what they are im willing to accept them
1286773 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important it is a ton of money but at this time i dont feel like i can put a price tag on my mental state
1286774 as a guy who went through that early in my career taking the medication i certainly understand
1286775 prayer and having people around me that i knew cared about me
1286776 stop some of the bleeding start some of the healing process maybe a little bit
1286777 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1286778 i like how spongebob handles life he gets picked on all the time but hes still happy he doesnt get angry with people he just goes through life with a smile on his face

1286794 since the inception of the top 8 in 1972 we have seen the birth of many legends and some truly memorable matches this year with the exciting innovations introduced by psl and the new sponsor mtn i feel that the competition will be fiercer than ever before and i am certain there are no favourites

1286809 not wanting too many choreographed sequences i chose to use only six professional dancers and six stunt guys the rest were 40 background extras who displayed quirky unusual moves in the audition with them in place and the troublesome logistics of the location sorted we were ready to have fun we only had two and a half days to shoot so the second camera was essential to capture enough of the pedestrian characters and gritty environment i needed the monkey was actually a highly revered method actor i was lucky to get him

1286812 speaker pelosi blocked their plan because it wont help lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1286813 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1286814 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis

1287074 orang orang yang makan mengambil riba tidak dapat berdiri melainkan seperti berdirinya orang yang kemasukan syaitan lantaran tekanan penyakit gila keadaan mereka yang demikian itu adalah disebabkan mereka berkata berpendapat sesungguhnya jual beli itu sama dengan riba padahal allah telah menghalalkan jual beli dan mengharamkan riba orang orang yang telah sampai kepadaya larangan dari tuhannya lalu terus berhenti dari mengambil riba maka baginya apa yang telah diambilnya dahulu sebelum datang larangan dan jurusannya terserah kepada allah orang yang mengulangi mengambil riba maka orang itu adalah penghuni penghuni neraka mereka kekal di dalamnya allah memusnahkan riba dan menyuburkan sedekah dan allah tidak menyukai setiap orang yang tetap dalam kekafiran dan selalu berbuat dosa sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman mengerjakan amal saleh mendirikan sholat dan menunaikan zakat mereka mendapat pahala di sisi tuhannya tidak ada kekhawatiran terhadap mereka dan tidak pula mereka bersedih hati hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dan tinggalkan sisa riba yang belum dipungut jika kamu orang orang yang beriman maka jika kamu tidak mengerjakan meninggalkan sisa riba maka ketahuilah bahwa allah dan rasul nya akan memerangimu dan jika kamu bertaubat dari pengambilan riba maka bagimu pokok hartamu kamu tidak menganiaya dan tidak pula dianiaya dan jika orang berhutang itu dalam kesukaran maka berilah tangguh sampai dia berkelapangan dan menyedekahkan sebagian atau semua utang itu lebih baik bagimu jika kamu mengetahui

1287078 we have 14 kennels where we are sleeping around 40 dogs at the moment in an ideal world we would have between 14 and 20 with 20 being our maximum
1287079 well in an ideal world we would have none but it seems that people realise we are here and they think it is ok to abandon their dogs now
1287080 people telephone and e mail us constantly asking about their pets or about animals they have found abandoned
1287081 we found one tied up to a tree at the ramada junction and one tied up near a busy shopping centre we find them abandoned at petrol stations and many get taken to the beach and dumped
1287082 people need to know that dogs are not disposable you cannot get one when it suits you and then throw it in the street when you get bored or need to leave
1287083 it seems that the excuses are getting around now as more and more people tell us that they are leaving for somewhere where they cannot take their dogs
1287084 however if i had had my dog for nine years as some owners here have then i would not relocate somewhere i couldnt take them
1287085 although it is great to see these animals have a safe place to stay with regular food and water and a bed to sleep on it is heartbreaking to watch them jumping at their gates desperate for any affection they can get from a passer by
1287086 it is clear that many of them would make great pets and all they need is a chance to show someone that to relinquish all responsibility for a pet because it doesnt suit you anymore is callous beyond belief pets are not plants that you can uproot and throwaway whenever you fancy

1287140 we are selling our souls for dross it is in fact positively harmful it is designed to give the message the uzbeks want the west to hear it exaggerates the role size organisation and activity of the imu an uzbek armed group and its links with al qaida the aim is to convince the west that the uzbeks are a vital cog against a common foe that they should keep the assistance especially military assistance coming and that they should mute the international criticism on human rights and economic reform
1287141 sixteen months ago it was difficult to argue with sis in the area of intelligence assessment but post butler the butler report looked into the intelligence failures leading up to the 2003 iraq war we know not only that they can get it wrong on even the most vital and high profile issues but that they have a particular yen for highly coloured material which exaggerates the threat that is precisely what the uzbeks give them at the khuderbegainov trial i met an old man from andizhan two of his children had been tortured in front of him until he signed a confession on the familys links with bin laden tears were streaming down his face i have no doubt they had as much connection with bin laden as i do this is the standard of the uzbek intelligence services

1287202 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1287203 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1287204 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1287216 the reality is that lewiss pace behind felipe during the first stint was very respectable he was able to peg him to around the three second mark until the first pit stops and we werent unduly concerned about the ferraris pace
1287217 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around
1287218 we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load
1287219 we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint
1287220 but unfortunately lewiss tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated
1287221 this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated
1287222 clearly felipe was strong in budapest particularly in the early part of the race and we come away from hungary with a clear intention of understanding where that perceived uplift of performance came from

1287225 a young frenchman named christophe laudamiel was still in perfumery school when he first read s skinds book what struck laudamiel most was a description of ripe juicy pale yellow plums and the girl who sells them to grenouille the first virgin he murders but what also struck him were his own similarities to grenouille tall and painfully thin the young laudamiel wasnt social he didnt always feel comfortable with people he wore a red mohawk in the novel when grenouille retreats to a cave in the middle of france to live the life of a hermit for seven years laudamiel understood the day i become a perfumer he said to himself i will do something with this book
1287226 the coffret contains fouler offerings such as atelier grimal paris 1738 and human existence which evoke the squalor and filth found in the sewer that was paris nearly two centuries ago
1287227 i do like to promote a more literary approach to the language of perfumery not only to describe scents but also to describe the creative process what was going on in the mind of the perfumers how did an ingredient end up where it is i want to reach the level to what i see in music and in literature although i am not a specialist in those areas certain things fascinate me so ill be happy to participate to your effort please send me your questions any question is ok i may just not answer them all
1287228 want to reach the level to what i see in music and in literature although i am not a specialist in those areas certain things fascinate me
1287229 theres too much confusion too much secrecy i think perfumery should be raised to the same level as music and painting and architecture with a symphony orchestra you can see all the music you can see all the instruments and in the end its still magical when youre educated you can determine the true value of things and you can make better choices its time for that same level of education to occur with scent

1287239 my first olfactory memory was obviously of my mother and her eau de cologne and the second one ill make you laugh my parents lived in an apartment in avenue du marechal mounoury in porte de la muette and we were evicted by the germans who requisitioned the entire building and that happened on my birthday or on my saints day i dont remember and despite all that my mother was so sweet she wanted to celebrate my birthday so she ordered a strawberry pie for me and to this day i still remember that strawberry pie
1287240 with its breezy almost transparent top notes fruits of the musk is delicate feminine and gauzy and very far removed from the typical overwhelmingly sweet fruity fragrances as the scent progresses it acquires an unexpected sensual depth in the heart of fruits of the musk the gossamer fruit and berry notes are replaced with luscious roses with a dark oud like undertone fruits of the musk notes strawberry leaves mandarin bergamot of italy blackberry rose essence of bulgaria white musk raspberry grey amber
1287241 the fragrance is a rare blend of berries and flowers with a distinctive tone of strawberries and almond giving an impression of vanilla notes strawberries bilberries black currant bulgarian rose jasmine ylang ylang sandalwood almond praline

1287244 which ive been unable to stop repeating to myself in recent days the poem i wrote is no longer even relevant to me but those superior lines continue to resonate and renew themselves
1287245 i dare say this poem is meaningless unless one has drifted into a certain vein of thought in a poem of this sort one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself or darts into a thing inward and subjective
1287246 if there is such a thing as reincarnation id like to come back as one of andrew birkins children
1287247 hes a sophisticated intellect and always has been but at the same time he can make gear shifts that i cant make wherein he can be perfectly comfortable with kids at their level of functioning and do what they do you know rushing off to the woods with flashlights whereas id rather be sitting in front of the fire with a bottle of red
1287248 never in a million years would i dream of smelling like andrew birkins hair his hair is not frankly his most appealing feature
1287249 the nastiest thing i have smelled in a long time
1287250 not sweet or heady stargazer is clean soothing and austerely beautiful a straight up lily with a sharp infusion of ginger
1287251 the lost paradise of the perfumes of the past and of the spirit
1287252 three years ago in paris i got out of a
1287253 greta garbo norma shearer paulette godard and ingrid bergman beautiful dramatic and romantic
1287254 it is indeed a perfume which specially delights and fascinates fragrance connoisseurs artists unconventional people
1287255 the highly personal character of my perfumes is the concentrate of multifaceted unique and incredibly vivid aromatic experiences which have always motivated me and been a part of my life for me creating a fragrance is like looking into a kaleidoscope in the way that the colorful fragments constantly form and re form amazingly beautiful and infinitely diverse patterns and pictures
1287256 on a sunday morning in spring with so many people in the world anything can happen
1287257 an endless love story as lovely as falling into sudden emotion just by smelling wordless
1287258 in the tradition of the alchemists and perfumers of ancient times
1287259 veil of tropical flowers with an amber base and an effervescent twilight of citrus notes
1287260 since i am a perfectionist and felt no rush i took my sweet time which is why it wasnt released until early 2007 that and i ran into every thinkable roadblock of the process and the demands of my family can leave little time for other pursuits
1287261 inspired by the integrity strength and beauty of queen esther
1287262 ancient persia with the flower gardens sweet incense and rich oils
1287263 we are motivated by the virtuous women of the bible and want the women of today to see themselves in them as they triumphantly faced their fears endured their hardships with valor walked in the strength of god and embodied virtue
1287264 most important result of it all for me is to have taught my girls to follow their dreams tough out the hard times and live with no regrets of an inspiration unfulfilled
1287265 i took this on purely as an artistic challenge which i enjoy in perfume making it ended up being much subtler than my fragrances usually do but it seems right like this i dont know if it would be wearable or not but i feel its right for pounds poem youll see what you think
1287266 i can smell the sunlight i know that sounds crazy but i can actually smell the sunlight
1287267 the end of something that never quite had its day
1287268 i look out my window and think of times long past
1287269 purpose is to gather and strengthen our existing community increase public awareness and education about pure and natural perfumes and establish standards of excellence in perfumery
1287270 ive tasted soil to analyze it in class i know why some soils are sweet and some sour i also know why to use or not use an aromatic in perfumery for the same reason if an aromatic is simply nice smelling or something that reminds a client of their mother i will not use it unless it accomplishes what it is meant to accomplish in the perfume
1287271 i always sketch or create a visual to use as a synchronistic springboard for a perfume just as i did in landscape architecture i design with my eyes and my nose and my dreamworld and my daily meditation then finally i will i listen to my conscious mind for kaffir i saw the scent in hot tropical blasts of aldehydes i saw fairchild in the chaos and beauty after a hurricane with clamshells and jasmine joined and in riverside i saw a sweet and romantic journey finding the oasis in a desert
1287272 only be available in a spray bottle since air is the element of change in this poetic perfume
1287273 i recently watched an interview with jean paul guerlain in which he recounted an early scent memory of a tarte aux fraises that his mother bought him for his birthday during a particularly tumultuous time in his childhood what are some of your early scent memories in what way do your scent memories influence your work as a perfumer
1287274 i find the scent of tulips fabulous because each time i smell tulips i cannot remove from my eyes pictures of colorful easter eggs
1287275 explanation as children we would always look for easter eggs in the garden and it was always the time of a big family reunion and the time when tulips were blooming in the garden where the eggs had fallen from the sky and also my grandfather a tulip freak i dont know why would always bring home a huge bouquet of tulips for easter family lunch
1287276 as a perfumer scent memories allow you to be creative allow you to create retro fragrances or to play with nostalgia which is always a feel good experience for you or your customers scent memories usually associated with nature or with some fabulous scent provide you with quality references and create challenges for you allowing you to reach for greater things aware of his or her own scent memories because they condition you in appreciating or depreciating a new creation one has to learn how to smell independently from his or her own personal emotions when it is necessary to provide a non biased critique about a fragrance
1287277 one day when i have time or if they give me money ill create the fragrance and will explain all the whys inside this poem there are a lot of concepts and notes packed inside this poem some are perfumistic some are literary some are aesthetic some are winks etc i could write a whole essay about it
1287278 lisas window opened wide when she discovered mandy aftels book
1287279 bright and warm as a summer breeze the main notes are orange blossoms frangipani neroli and gentle jasmine authentic ambergris lends its velvety warmth to myrrh vetiver and lavender concrete base notes voile is a light fresh floral fragrance
1287280 is a study in opposites one theme blends the bright green notes of linden blossom wintergreen and celery seed the second theme combines the dreamy lush notes of tuberose ginger lily aged patchouli and rich vanilla scented tonka bean together the complex ingredients create astonishing memories of forests lakes and meadows
1287281 decoding obscure notes a series about the building blocks of natural perfumery
1287282 all the biblical plants and aromatics that were used to cleanse purify and seduce in that magnificent poem
1287283 randomly create an ever changing estranged impression on the beings that weave in and out of its presence
1287284 clothes and skin contaminated with the lives of strangers and passers by
1287285 it is in the small details we notice about life where our most accurate feelings are defined
1287286 woody and wet dusty yet clean and with a light air of floralcy and a hint of bitterness reminiscent of cherry blossoms
1287287 designing fragrance and making a painting or making another piece of art like a piece of sculpture or something to me is the same thing im just utilizing another sense and im translating the criteria from one sense if you will to another
1287288 created to illustrate 17th and 18th century styles of fragrance with some as re creations of perfumes that would have been worn by the luminaries of versailles at the courts of louis xiv louis xv and louis xvi
1287289 smoky roasted seashells and champaca a heady floral with spice and honey notes
1287290 smells like the night air in hawaii redolent of sultry flowers warmth and light it almost shimmers created from the rarest and most costly essences osmanthus orange flower absolute ambrette seed a botanical musk and the legendary ambergris a limited edition
1287291 the complicated aroma of a wet dog crossed with crushed violets
1287292 city life its been a honeymoon cant take no mo
1287293 i saw suddenly a beautiful face and then another and another and then a beautiful childs face and then another beautiful woman and i tried all that day to find words for what this had meant to me
1287294 musing on profane matters on perfume creations on building a business or on daily things that happen around me
1287295 thinking about black wet black wet black wood but wait things are much more complicated than i originally thought thinking also dirty corners many people stuck together on their way to the light well we will see and you shall see the result in a couple of weeks at least as text
1287296 being creative is a stay in a slaughterhouse you come up with little shiny bulbs idea bubbles that grow on a cosy planet branch out form a black forest of flowers after a while suffocating the earth beneath and get cut to make room for the next little bubble growing into pink flowers
1287297 continuing to think about the little experiment see yesterdays post too i see blue eyes time to cut deeper
1287298 this project basically is a piece of text inspiring me and others to think i figured out i might first start with a canvas and oil to clear the mind and think about the few words
1287299 dust and the smell of human beings after work around the corner just a touch but it is there
1287300 while proserpine was playing in this glade and gathering violets or radiant lilies while with girlish fondness she filled the folds of her gown and her basket trying to outdo her companions in her picking dis hades almost in a moment saw her prized her took her so swift as this is love the frightened goddess cries out to her mother to her friends most of all to her mother with piteous mouth since she had torn her dress at the opening the flowers she had collected fell from her loosened tunic and even their scattering caused her virgin tears
1287301 her limbs caused her to cleave to the ground a wan pallor transposing her into bloodless petals in part she was flushed red and a violet concealed her face thus she whom roots held turns always to the sun now she watches over him having been transformed for the sake of love
1287302 a peculiarly poetic combination of warm sweet floral and woody notes a mixture of delicacy and brutality which to my mind at least is an allegory of childhood love
1287303 i remember stepping out of lutenss purple shop into the perpetually quiet walled gardens armed with this purple smell with a purple name thinking i was carrying the most precious object in the world
1287304 the scent of violet flowers is very evanescent and as soon as you are able to detect the fragrance it disappears what happens is the scent paralyzes the nasal cilia so that they are unable to detect scent one has to walk away from the violet and come back to it to be able to experience once again this very particular fragrance
1287305 the truth is there is no blue word to express you
1287306 forgiveness is the scent the violet releases upon the heel that has crushed it
1287307 the gaze of a ruined water nymph sunk in the depths
1287308 she was up on the mountain she didnt have any car or any money she didnt even have any clothes to take with her
1287309 are you going to let that bitch tell you what to do
1287310 and she doesnt want to see any of these kids die like charlie if she wants me to get a job on the railroad im going to get a job on the railroad
1287311 you better make it a good one because its gonna be the last
1287312 no matter how hard you hit me youre going to have to go to sleep sometime and when you do im coming to find you and im bringing this here iron skillet youre not gonna hurt another of these kids and theres not going to be any more moonshining in this family
1287313 for praise is like ambergrize a little unexpected whiff of it is the most agreeable thing in the world but when a whole lump of it is thrust to your nose it is a stink and strikes you down
1287314 what should we do but sing his praise that led us through the watery maze unto an isle so long unknown and yet far kinder than our own proclaim the ambergris on shore he cast of which we rather boast the gospels pearl upon our coast and in these rocks for us did frame a temple where to sound his name
1287315 by these to sing of cleanly wantonness i sing of dews of rains and piece by piece of balm of oil of spice and ambergris canzonet
1287316 she stood the reaper challenging a kiss the perfume of her skin was ambergris
1287317 in response to a widely spread lack of interest in my writings this volume is now submitted with the fullest confidence that it will receive the same amount of acclamation as that to which i have become accustomed
1287318 it was ambergris that was typically carried by medieval and renaissance persons in pomanders pomme dor to ward off unpleasant smells the magical and ritual use of perfumes inner traditions 1990 richard and iona miller write that ambergris was an important trade commodity since at least 1000 bce when arabian traders began to export it to other lands for use in perfumery and as a food spice i hear that eggs scrambled with ambergris is still quite the delicacy herman melville addresses the use of ambergris as food and ritual item in moby dick 1851 the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in rome who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill savor cologne water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst
1287319 what assia valued most in herself was her allure for men
1287320 ive never come across anyone like her she had no moral sense at all she was like a very beautiful wild animal
1287321 born in 1947 the fragrance carries connotations of the hunger for glamour the austerity of war and the hopes for future miss dior does not reveal her charms upon the first encounter requiring a longer and patient acquaintance especially for those who are used to the eager to please modern fragrances the green pepper sharpness of galbanum is underpinned by a classical gardenia note which is bright dry and intriguingly metallic these effervescent notes slowly melt into the floral heart of miss dior and yet the animalic darkness is never far behind soon the chypre base that supports the refinement of floral notes takes center stage the composition becomes veiled in duskiness punctuated by gilded warmth
1287322 everyone who knew assia wevill remembers her vivid physical presence
1287323 here the colors represent different olfactory profiles it would be interesting to guess which is which of course the easiest one would be to attribute white to diorissimo it being a more virginal lily of the valley scent although not quite but which is miss dior and which diorama therein lies the charm
1287324 quite simply predatory she made a pass at every man she met
1287325 although there is the clean overlay of aldehydic waxiness and soft flowers you catch a whiff of more feral impolite essences under the clean exterior there is the carnal cat call and you feel as if it is perhaps too scrubbed clean to be without ulterior motive miss dior is the scent of sexual awakening
1287326 it is rather dark and it is rather blatantly dirty and i adore it
1287327 feral beauty feral eyes feral touch and feral movements there was a feral purr in her voice and something feral in the arrangement of her hair what a seductive animal
1287328 inside a simple blade of grass lie all the powers of nature and in the blade of grass which assia sent to ted lay the seeds of everything that happened to them
1287329 i m aghast when i see how incredibly i ve confined amp stunted my existence when i compare my feeling of what i could be with what i am
1287330 we finally reduced each other to a state where our actions and normal states of mind were like madness
1287331 more misery than i could possibly endure no husband no father for shura i have lived on the dream of living with ted i have lived a full and comparatively long life it is necessary to know when theres no more life to live i couldnt leave little shura by herself shes too old to be adopted
1287332 the other tragic woman in the life of ted hughes
1287333 ted hughes treated mistress like a tyrant claims new biography
1287334 ted hughes revealed as domestic tyrant who laid down law to mistress
1287335 three years ago in paris i got out of a train at la concorde and saw
1287336 i dare say it is meaningless unless one has drifted into a certain vein of thought in a poem of this sort one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself or darts into a thing inward and subjective modern american poetry

1287341 there was a verbal problem with someone in the same group and another patron
1287342 that person was told to behave they chose to still get a bit irate and agitated so security asked him to leave and then just said why dont the rest of you move on and they did and todd never took any part in that
1287343 it wasnt physical it wasnt a problem todd didnt have anything to drink whilst he was here
1287344 its frustrating in terms of trying to get things done
1287345 my understanding is he had a family holiday booked so im not necessarily pointing the finger at him the timing of it is just bad luck because wed rather get this out of the road
1287346 he had a cortisone yesterday into the affected area so he cant do anything until thursday so well know definitely by thursday
1287347 our expectation is hell play he wasnt miles off last week but if he played last week it could have impacted on his ability to play the next three
1287348 its a tribute to wade and our medical staff that hes in a position to come back into the side now

1287356 the federation of poles in great britain has been concerned about newspaper coverage which has sought to emphasise negative aspects of the polish presence in the uk
1287357 in our view the worst examples linked poles with words and phrases like feckless chancers race riots swamp the nhs fears for schools cut price treatment push british graduates to back of the jobs queue killers drug smugglers and rapist we consider that this has made poles living in the uk feel vulnerable and persecuted
1287358 some might argue that these robust headlines were aimed more at the british government its immigration policy and at the european union fair enough
1287359 we maintain that poles have felt humiliated by the coverage and are vulnerable to numerous acts of overt hostility and even violence which they have experienced from a vociferous minority of uk citizens
1287360 there have been hundreds of cases of hate crime against poles in this country recorded in the last two years some leading to death or permanent injury and we would not want these incidents to be encouraged by potentially inflammatory newspaper stories or headlines
1287361 we came to a better understanding of each others position
1287362 we were never anti polish they just interpreted some of our headlines as that because they were written in our usual robust way
1287363 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do

1287366 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1287367 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security

1287375 on average return of premium products cost more than traditional term life insurance policies but they offer a guaranteed return
1287376 however before you are lured by the appeal of a refund you should first make sure you purchase an affordable life insurance policy that you wont let lapse in order to makes sure you dont leave your family unprotected
1287377 whats the rate of return on the difference in premium

1287419 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you

1287425 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1287426 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1287427 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1287428 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1287429 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1287430 for example parents could sit with their child on an ordinary train first then sit with them somewhere dark then perhaps have games where people jump out and say boo gradual ways to decrease fear
1287431 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1287432 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1287433 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1287434 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices

1287445 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1287446 seven eats all the numbers there are no more numbers after 8
1287447 well seven ate nine so its 7 8 10 so then seven ate ten so its 7 8 11 so then seven ate 11 and then it just keeps going
1287448 weve only explained a tiny fraction of why people might develop schizophrenia and much more work needs to be done to connect specific changes to the full spectrum of other types of genetic factors that might influence schizophrenia as well as the way in which those might interact with the environment
1287449 by the same token the companys doing pretty well and were really happy with what were doing so well see i mean anything is possible
1287450 we had been socialized to doing so many things ourselves whether its box creation funding our own development etcetera that when we came to meet with folks about a distribution deal and i use that phrase intentionally we were looking for somebody to do a certain set of services that we didnt want to do or werent versed in and nothing more
1287451 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues
1287452 big willy unleashed was designed by wii developers specifically for the wii when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled
1287453 any time we undertake something we have a goal of creating franchises
1287454 pc for now is what were focusing on but there is a console future for the franchise
1287455 we havent really talked about what thats going to be but one thing were focused on as folks probably have seen in regards to mass effect on the pc is whenever we do a platform choice were very definitive and very specific
1287456 we dont splash it across all the platforms like in the case with mass pc we worked really hard to make it even better than the console version the pc gives us more tools to do that with thats the approach were taking with dragon age and other games at bioware
1287457 were seeing record levels of industry growth and success for our business and our industry so i think that bodes really well for what were going to be able to achieve in future years
1287458 i think the ability to have a longer cycle to continue to drive value and innovate theres a lot of potential in the 360 that hasnt been realized and that bodes for a pretty good run in the market and a lot of capabilities our box has that consumers are just getting used to

1287463 in todays competitive business environment companies large and small need to evaluate their current bandwidth needs to effectively serve customers
1287464 most of the mid sized businesses we work with want to transition to one voice and data network and are surprised at how cost effective and seamless the transition really is
1287465 high bandwidth applications are not just for large enterprises cost effective high value solutions with customer service support included are available for companies of all sizes and are especially important for growing businesses
1287466 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

1287469 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1287470 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1287475 the gulf between the young lads and the experienced players is quite significant
1287476 something must be noticed i just found the psram mode did not autobackup the save its a mistake of our programer im sorry so just test this version new kernel will release soon
1287477 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1287478 if you dont quit something bad will happen to you
1287479 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1287480 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1287481 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1287482 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1287483 vale m s actuar exponi ndose a arrepentirse de ello que arrepentirse de no haber hecho nada
1287484 just unbelievable i almost had to pinch myself when i saw felipe massas engine failing with three laps to go and i knew that i was in second position i had pressure from kimi raikkonen in the other ferrari over the closing laps and i was struggling a little with the softer tyre in the final stint we knew from friday practice that the soft tyres would be more difficult i had a reasonable pace and saw i was 9 seconds ahead of kimi but then the team told me that he was half a second a lap quicker i just tried to push more while staying focused on not destroying the tyres in the end he was catching me up but i kept cool and made sure i didnt make any mistakes i knew from gp2 how hard it is to pass in budapest and it is even tougher in f1
1287485 in hockenheim we had a good race pace before my crash and we came to budapest and just kept that speed the tf108 felt really good from friday onwards and we didnt have to make any big changes it was just perfect until that last stint with soft tyres which was a bit tricky im in my first full f1 championship and with just half a season gone im on the podium it feels great it was a perfect weekend
1287486 pretty important the way things worked out because robert had a tough race ive had to improve my starts because my reaction times were not perfect at the first couple of races this time the start was really great and actually although qualifying was good i felt i might even have been a couple of places further up the grid i was second fastest to massas ferrari with low fuel in q2 but struggled a bit in q3 with tyre temperatures i actually set my best time on used tyres because i couldnt get the tyres up to temperature for the first flying lap of my last run because kubica was a bit slower on the out lap compared to me and i had to slow down i lost a bit of performance on the flying lap but in the end i was happy with fifth even though i thought i could have gone quicker than robert
1287487 i dont like an understeering car and that was a problem sometimes this season but in hockenheim and budapest the feel of the car was much more in my direction and better suited my driving style i could just put the car where i wanted to in a corner and that was the case in both qualifying and the race
1287488 no until i came into the medical centre i was sure that maybe i made a mistake and ran a bit too wide over the kerb with a heavy fuelled car i had felt some bottoming and so i thought it might be my own mistake but then the team told me that the rear suspension collapsed and that was the reason for the crash when i saw it for the first time it looked more spectacular than it felt in the car for sure it was a bit painful on the back in the first impact and i must have breathed at the wrong moment because i was a bit winded but i was ready to go home from hospital that night although it was standard practice to keep me overnight for observation
1287489 actually answering all the same questions probably took more energy out of me than the crash i want to make the news for race results not accidents in fact what was worse was a minor case of food poisoning i picked up at the jerez test the week after the heat was no issue in hungary but when i drank quite a lot throughout the race i again had a few problems with my stomach i wasnt feeling perfect after the race but the heat wasnt the biggest problem
1287490 the grid is very competitive and at one circuit or in certain conditions red bull is stronger then next race it is us and so its quite up and down and difficult to predict but the tf108 has shown good performance in hot conditions and we were always confident for budapest
1287491 ive studied a computer game walked around the track and seen some pictures from the recent f3 race there it looks pretty interesting for a street circuit
1287492 i will go to los angeles to monterey where there is a big old timer event where i will drive a fia website

1287632 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1287633 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1287634 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1287635 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1287636 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1287637 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1287638 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1287639 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1287640 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1287641 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world

1287652 theres also a spectacular home in baie durf which is nestled into a hill and has 400 tons of rock lining the driveway
1287653 weve priced the tickets at 15 but last year so many people donated even more
1287654 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on
1287655 lets just try this once more and if its the last one thats hard lines
1287656 the inclusion of the idt low power amb device helps elpida achieve twice the capacity without impacting power consumption which is critically important for todays power hungry computing platforms
1287657 we do a lot of route reconnaissance like patrolling routes that no one really uses to travel
1287658 weve gone to abandoned buildings and factories to search for contraband
1287659 we came into a village where coalition forces hadnt been in a long time

1287670 hes my limit a big rangy grey and this bloke is a short stocky bay
1287671 they are complete opposites to look at and i think theyll race like complete opposites too
1287672 this guy is going to be a 1200 1400 metre horse where as the other bloke is more of a miler 1600m to 2400 metre runner and its further proof that there are no rules in breeding at times
1287673 if this horse drew one of the inside gates i would have been very confident but now hes going to need plenty of luck
1287674 the one thing he does share with my limit is that hes a bloody good horse and hopefully he can find a way to win tomorrow
1287675 having jimmy on board makes a big difference but i think the horse will probably be better for the run hes got plenty of ability but still has a bit to learn
1287676 barriers have played their part its crucial to draw well at doomben
1287677 hes coming off a really strong win over a mile carrying 57kg and because its a set weights race he will have 53kg
1287678 successful indeed are the believers those who offer their salaat prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness and those who turn away from al laghw dirty false evil vain talk falsehood and all that allaah has forbidden and those who pay the zakaat and those who guard their chastity i e private parts from illegal sexual acts except from their wives or the captives and slaves that their right hands possess for then they are free from blame but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors those who are faithfully true to their amanaat all the duties which allaah has ordained honesty moral responsibility and trusts etc and to their covenants and those who strictly guard their five compulsory congregational salawaat prayers at their fixed stated hours these are indeed the inheritors who shall inherit the firdaus paradise they shall dwell therein forever
1287679 and allaah would never make your faith prayers to be lost i e your prayers offered towards jerusalem
1287680 perform as salaat iqamaat as salaat verily as salaat the prayer prevents from al fahshaa i e great sins of every kind unlawful sexual intercourse etc and al munkar i e disbelief polytheism and every kind of evil wicked deed etc and the remembering praising etc of you by allaah in front of the angels is greater indeed than your remembering praising etc
1287681 and the remembering praising etc of you by allaah in front of the angels is greater indeed than your remembering praising etc
1287682 sit with us and let us devote ourselves to faith for an hour
1287683 there is no faith for the one who possesses no honesty and trustworthiness
1287684 from a mans perfecting his religion is his leaving alone that which does not concern him
1287685 it is understood from this that from a mans deficiency in his religion is his indulging in that which does not concern him this includes everything of secondary importance whichever form it may take what should concern him is all that relates to the essentials of his livelihood that which fulfils his need for sustenance clothing keeping himself chaste thereby and the like thereof from the necessities of life excluding those things relating to his own personal pleasures he should be concerned with all that relates to his salvation in the hereafter that being islam eemaan and ihsaan in this way he stays safe from ruin all forms of evil and argumentation this is part of perfecting his religion firm establishment of his piety and keeping away from following his desires whereas striving to accomplish other than this is loss of irreplaceable valuable time in doing what he was not created for so whoever worships his lord with realisation of his closeness to his lord and of his lords closeness to him has perfected his religion as has preceded
1287686 part of that which does not concern the worshipper is his learning fields of knowledge of lesser importance whilst leaving knowledge of greater importance like the person who abandons knowledge which causes benefit to himself and engages himself in learning that which he could correct others with like for example the knowledge of how to debate excusing himself for that saying my intention is to benefit the people yet if he was truthful he would have busied himself with correcting himself and his heart by removing bad characteristics like jealousy showing off pride haughtiness towards others and other destructive attributes they say debating is equivalent to a quarter of islam and others say half of it and some say all of it
1287687 from a mans perfecting his religion is his busying himself with that which concerns him
1287688 the more important takes precedence over that which is less important
1287689 verily allaah the mighty and majestic is generous he loves generosity and noble character and hates the despicable character
1287690 this noble character is the manners and attributes ordained in the religion not those deemed noble in worldly affairs for the elevated in them are in actual fact despised

1287694 he always runs a reasonable race and doesnt disappoint too often but he just didnt come up that well last preparation
1287695 i wasnt that happy with him but this time even though he has only had one run he seems to have come back in pretty good order
1287696 for a trainer who is making headlines around the world this is a glowing endorsement of the melbourne spring racing carnival as a truly international racing event
1287697 these are without doubt the best quality international entries we have received since the inception of international competition in the spring racing carnival in the early 90s
1287698 could not substantiate the complaint but notified all riders of their obligation
1287699 he seems a very nice young bloke and a very good worker
1287700 he rode about half a dozen at work this morning and then went to the rosehill trials and rode another seven there
1287701 everything has gone smoothly so far and hopefully we can have a good day tomorrow
1287702 she ran into a heavy track at canterbury that day and the drier it gets for tomorrow the better she will run
1287703 hes drawn a bit awkwardly 12 but he gets back anyway so it probably wont affect him too much
1287704 hes shown us a bit of ability in all of his runs so far and i expect him to go well again
1287705 kerrin will need plenty of things to go his way but shes forward enough to do something if she does get a nice run

1287719 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here

1287724 i think its fantastic that we have shows going on friday saturday and sunday i think there is a lot more awareness and enthusiasm about the event
1287725 it was a huge success the weather co operated and it was great for local merchants and restaurants
1287726 it seems to me that the boy got out of the hospital
1287727 the girl was transferred to the hospital because she is fractured severely and had complications on her lower body
1287728 the younger kids the teenagers would not be up at that time
1287729 its really sad that this would happen in our city i think the family must be in a lot of pain right now
1287730 the first thing im thinking about is what the family is going through
1287731 the naa has received reports that three pools were broken into robbed and suffered extensive damages

1287734 state of the nation race and racism in scotland 2008
1287735 report a collation of statistics and data relating to black minority ethnic bme people in scotland
1287736 these findings reveal how pockets of discrimination combine to present a far more alarming picture racism affecting people in scotland in all areas of society racism still persists despite the best efforts of government and well meaning organisations it is important we lobby harder for more effective measures to counteract these prejudices and that the scottish government commits to eradicating these problems by whatever means
1287737 eradicating prejudice should be a priority for us all because until then we cannot say we are committed to full inclusion today
1287738 strong statistical data is essential in scotland if government and its agencies are to truly address the needs of black minority ethnic bme communities for example a report recently published by the ministerial task force on health inequalities highlighted the lack of ethnicity data collection by nhs scotland as a concern making it more difficult to adequately meet the needs of bme people
1287739 this report seeks to address such requirements and will hopefully become an invaluable reference tool for policy makers
1287740 no you cant do that but you can do this

1287742 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
1287743 instead of investigating and pursuing accountability for shoddy and dangerous school buildings the authorities are resorting to rtl to silence and lock up concerned citizens like teacher liu shaokun and others
1287744 these actions further undermine human rights and the peaceful olympics called for by the authorities and reflect an irresponsible callousness towards the sichuan earthquake victims and parents of the thousands of children killed by collapsed school buildings
1287745 anotherexcellent piece of inventive chilling suspense unemployed london film critic simon lester receives an apparent lucky break when his old film professor commissions him to write a book about forgotten silent film comedian tubby thackeray once deemed as good as chaplins and keatons thackerays movies are mysteriously missing from cinematic archives in tracking down references and attempting to solve the riddle of thackerays anomalous absence simon treks across the seamier landscape of film production from porn factories to amsterdam brothels after many maddening false leads encounters with sinister clowns and e mail exchanges with a particularly snide film buff simon stumbles on a disturbing secret about thackerays real identity that may have less to do with comedy than with an ancient evil
1287746 allowing illegal aliens to participate in federal guest worker programs without first returning their native country
1287747 starting from his own premise that we need illegal immigrants for our workforce blaine has proposed a program allowing illegal aliens to obtain work visas with the hopes of eventually joining a guest worker program or becoming u s citizens
1287748 turning a blind eye toward lawbreakers and inviting illegal immigrants to take jobs when our economy is struggling is not consistent with the values of the people of the ninth district

1287763 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1287764 i think anybody would find it difficult to maintain a very high level of popularity when average people are having the problems they are having today in the uk and the us with the soaring price of gasoline and the cost of living going up
1287765 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1287766 the prime minister when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do but i am very clear in my mind that provided we can get across to people what were for the difference that the government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn this situation around
1287767 im optimistic we can turn things round and we can win
1287768 the prose and the atmosphere is beautiful and decaying and everythings grey with astonishing little bursts of unforgettable colour deep dark remarkable stuff
1287769 the novel really feels like a secret an alternative world a half dimension removed from ours a place woven out of whisper and shadow populated with forgotten creatures and even less remembered thoughts
1287770 sedias novel is emblematic of much that is good about contemporary fantasy it unites a classy prose style with first hand experience of a 90s moscow crippled by post soviet economic decline the story is infused with the tropes and traditions of fantasy but set amid the grim reality of that decades turbulent politics

1287790 her odd and oddly affecting book beautifully written is in part a story of house love that borders on madness its also the story of her father and not the least of its accomplishments is that it instantly catapults him into the front rank of impossible and eccentric english parents right up there with the overbearing thomas butler nightmarish father of samuel with evelyn waugh who wrote that i despise all my seven children equally and even with lord redesdale nancy mitfords farve who once kicked a young man off the family estate just because he carried a pocket comb

1287793 like da vinci its mysteries are no more than mystifications unlike its exemplar it is put together clumsily an assemble it yourself kit enclosed with instructions in korean a more skillful handling would frame it all as a running mystery instead it becomes a creeping confusion to succeed a mystery smuggles its truth past the reader here the smuggling is done so awkwardly as to spill out rattly chunks of hint contradiction and clue while trying to get through
1287794 the flat colloquial style that serves to heighten the magical qualities of murakamis fiction makes this work of straightforward nonfiction sound pedestrian
1287795 in seven trenchant chapters and a postscript mr kamen demolishes one cherished fantasy after another drawing on archival sources unpublished manuscripts and a vast body of scholarship in several languages he takes a fresh and often scathing look at spanish notions of nationhood monarchy and empire and shows them to rise almost wholly out of ignorance and self delusion the effect is as if poor raving don quixote were not simply given a cold shower but strapped to a gurney for a series of electroshock treatments and yet only someone who loves spain deeply could have written this book
1287796 andrew taylors historical novels are simply some of the best being published i read the american boy straight through and then turned around and read it again just to catch the nuances the touches of poe and trollope and dickens i devoured bleeding heart square in a day the setting taylor is a master of place and time is britain in 1934 it is the beginning of the end of the empire the ruling classes are toying with fascism and communism the war to end war is 15 years past in short we are in the time of mainstream novels like atonement and the remains of the day but without the despair one might say that taylor in this brilliantly constructed and beautifully written crime novel has transcended the mainstream
1287797 night work is an exhausting experience not just because the events portrayed are harrowing indeed at times genuinely horrific but because of the readers constant anxiety that glavinic to his own mystery is jonass sleeping self a genuinely separate entity or is he a hallucination the measure of glavinics skill lies in how long he keeps both possibilities open and how well he manipulates reader anxiety around them when an answer arrives it is as implacable as the rest of this disturbing book

1288100 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1288101 you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1288102 i love it that means the ads are totally calvin totally provocative and a little controversial

1288109 if youre good at something never do it for free
1288110 some men cant be bought reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
1288111 nobody panics when things go according to plan even if the plan is horrifying if i tell the press that tomorrow like a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will get blown up nobody panics

1288113 this is the reason why i moved back you cant get this in england
1288114 st pancras international is leading the way in creating a new experience in rail travel for the 21st century this station is more than a place to catch a train its a state of the art destination station with over 50 restaurants bars and shops and the launch of our new free wi fi service the entire customer experience is underpinned by superior technology and service excellence st pancras international really is the perfect place to meet browse refuel and now go online
1288115 the continued strong performance of property amp casualty and life amp health demonstrates our ability to generate healthy operating earnings even in challenging market conditions the financial market turbulence continues but despite this we are strongly capitalised and our investment portfolio remains sound
1288116 the difficult market environment also creates new opportunities underpinned by its strict underwriting discipline expansion in emerging markets and new product offerings swiss re has the execution capability and capital strength to seize these opportunities
1288117 i know hes flattered and honored to have his name in the mix
1288118 if anything itll probably just make it easier for him to raise money
1288119 the bench is already thin without cantor its almost nonexistent
1288120 i really dont want to discuss the issue of taxes because as soon as you do it perpetuates the addiction

1288122 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1288123 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1288124 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1288125 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1288126 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1288127 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1288128 jeff once said that he couldnt imagine anything more important than reinventing the book
1288129 it is the finest and noblest book of men in war that i have ever read
1288130 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1288131 ill stand out there in the rain storm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard
1288132 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1288133 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1288134 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1288135 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1288136 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1288137 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1288138 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1288139 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field

1288167 reste la question de la r conciliation avec les int gristes toujours en rupture avec rome qui formait lun des buts avou s de ce motu proprio sans doute beno t xvi nesp rait il pas grand chose des responsables de la fraternit saint pie x qui fin juin ont refus une ni me main tendue la croix du 2 juillet rome garde toutefois lespoir que certains fid les et pr tres int gristes sauteront cette fois le pas
1288168 il est libre chaque homme dembrasser et de professer la religion quil aura r put e vraie dapr s la lumi re de la raison
1288169 a notre poque il nest plus utile que la religion catholique soit consid r e comme lunique religion de l tat lexclusion de tous les autres cultes
1288170 aussi cest avec raison que dans quelques pays catholiques la loi a pourvu ce que les trangers qui sy rendent y jouissent de lexercice public de leurs cultes particuliers
1288171 cest pourquoi le droit cette immunit persiste en ceux l m me qui ne satisfont pas lobligation de chercher la v rit et dy adh rer son exercice ne peut tre entrav d s lors que demeure sauf un ordre public juste

1288177 cest v ritablement se complaire dans des raisonnements th ologiques abstraits au demeurant il ne me semble pas que le christ ait attendu des romains quils d fendent la vraie foi et le christ en fin de compte cest une bonne source
1288178 je doute du schisme vraiment parce que nulle part je nai autant entendu parler du pape en disant quil fallait le suivre et l couter qu la fsspx
1288179 et il ny a pas de magist re de la fsspx sup rieur au pape il y a ce que disait leglise avant vatican ii et ce quelle dit apr s ce qui est l g rement diff rent

1288181 nous avons un pape parfaitement lib ral regrettait mgr fellay dans un sermon le 1er juin saint nicolas du chardonnet sindignant de la fascination du pape pour un pays fond sur les principes ma onniques

1288183 je ne peux quadmirer le pape de continuer consid rer quil peut y avoir un dialogue valable
1288184 non cest le magist re ancien que lon oppose lactuel
1288185 en apparence ce diff rend porte sur une subtilit mais cette messe dite de saint pie v comme on le voit ec ne devient le symbole de la condamnation du concile or je naccepterai en aucune circonstance que lon condamne le concile par un symbole si cette exception tait accept e le concile entier sera branl et par voie de cons quence lautorit apostolique du concile
1288186 les traditionalistes ont trouv un alli avec le pape allemand
1288187 cest donc juste titre que du christ benoit xvi en passant par st paul on en a conclu que quiconque dispose dune parcelle dautorit dispose en fait dune d l gation de la seule et unique autorit divine lorsque st paul compare lautorit du mari sur sa femme celle du christ sur son glise et la suj tion qui en d coule il ne dit pas autre chose non
1288188 cette unique vraie religion nous croyons quelle subsiste dans leglise catholique et apostolique qui le seigneur j sus a confi le mandat de la faire conna tre tous les hommes

1288199 d ployant la force de son bras il disperse les superbes il renverse les puissants de leurs tr nes et il l ve les humbles il comble de biens les affam s renvoie les riches les mains vides

1288210 in common with other organisations across the country we introduced our 0844 number to better manage the large volume of calls we receive from patients and visitors in a quicker and more efficient way
1288211 our four hospitals serve a population of more than half a million people and the benefit of having our current system means that we not only have the capacity to take a large number of calls at any one time but callers only have one number to remember when contacting any of our hospitals
1288212 we receive 0 0275p for a ten second call by the network provider of the 0844 number this money has been reinvested into clinical services at our trust to ensure that we deliver high quality care to our patients we also continue to make improvements to the 0844 telephone service this includes introducing an automated system which means that callers can be put through more quickly to the right ward or department we expect this to be in place by the end of the year

1288274 what a great tournament we got treated like royalty between the manchester host and babe ruth regional officials it was first class all the way and we were happy to get two wins and send two teams home

1288276 i thought we had potential but we got a lot farther than i thought we were going to get
1288277 it seemed really long at the beginning but then it was august 2nd and it seemed so short
1288278 it was a great experience we made a lot of new friendships with guys we played against and we all really bonded well together
1288279 it was such a great feeling knowing we represented new hampshire well
1288280 it was by far the toughest camp and it definitely got us ready for the next step and it paid off the most at the end
1288281 you play against kids from exeter and bishop guertin and dont enjoy them but when you come here everyone gets along
1288282 out of all the races i have ever done this one was the nicest
1288283 we went through that last year in atlanta with michael vick the media and on tv and people outside may think its a distraction but us as players weve got to come out here and practice were not talking about that on the practice field
1288284 each person who has a job being focused to do it so everybody else can depend on him and they are accountable for it
1288285 i knew they werent just signing me and that was it i knew they were going to bring young guys in thats a part of the nfl youve got to go out there and do your job
1288286 i missed a lot on ir but it was nothing too serious im feeling good right now so im ready to go
1288287 has had a lot of different responsibilities for us in the kicking game playing both corner and safety defensively
1288288 hes got good experience in a couple different systems so i dont think anything he is doing here is anything that new
1288289 he shows up with a play or two every day and he is a hard working guy
1288290 it was pretty tough because you couldnt get a hold of anyone back there
1288291 that was probably the hardest thing not knowing for like four or five hours not knowing anything and just doing a lot of praying
1288292 eventually he got hold of my mother and then they called me
1288293 no matter what goes on youve still got to play
1288294 if he gets what hes looking for weve tried to accommodate him as best we can within our wage structure
1288295 hopefully something can be decided in the next couple of days
1288296 weve done a little bit of wheeling and dealing and weve spoken to him about certain things
1288297 i know theres another couple of teams in for him so lets not say that two and two makes four just now
1288298 die deutschen sehen ihre bank als dienstleister und partner der ihnen in finanziellen dingen fachkundig weiterhilft
1288299 their speed is a full team speed we got tired chasing them they got on a roll in the second half and didnt let up
1288300 we adjusted our blocking up front and went with fresh backs once ferriter got going there was no stopping that offense
1288301 weve been practicing two and three times a day thats what we wanted was a goose egg the offense stepped it up big in the second half

1288303 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1288304 i think anybody would find it difficult to maintain a very high level of popularity when average people are having the problems they are having today in the uk and the us with the soaring price of gasoline and the cost of living going up
1288305 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1288306 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1288307 just trust the people to at whatever time he stands for election to make a good judgment you get one of these jobs the best politics is to do the job
1288308 ive won it plenty of times i will just go into it and shoot the best score that i can thats all i can do
1288309 sometimes it comes down to luck to determine these championships
1288310 you hit a good shot when somebody makes a bad shot sometimes you just happen to put a couple of good holes together and it gives you a lot of momentum where someone else is having a rough game you just never know
1288311 i think whats happened over the years is that a lot of girls that come through college and had a little bit of success turn pro
1288312 its a shame because youve lost a lot of good players who havent done much with their game some people try to make a career out of it but once they turn pro they think they can make it on tour and they cant once they do that they dont play golf anymore
1288313 instead of using their college education to make a living a lot of these girls turn to golf
1288314 thats why we have lost so many amateur players we could have a lot more amateur players and the league could be stronger
1288315 we are strongly capitalised and our investment portfolio remains sound
1288316 swiss re has to execution capability and capital strength to seize these opportunities
1288317 the acquisition and the price paid fits into the strategy and is good news
1288318 in the past 12 months i have seen builders slash their staffs by more than 50 percent and consolidate operations in one office
1288319 before the builders had offices everywhere sacramento central valley and the bay area the current trend is to have one office run all three
1288320 i have worries all the time you just see how the economy is
1288321 i dont think any of us are guaranteed anything anymore

1288332 it goes without saying that achieving autonomy is at times necessary and perhaps even the best offered option to adopt when it comes to a country that is so diverse such as iraq but it is also important that the unity of the nation is preserved as any break up of the country would lead to further instability and violence no matter how autonomous some regions may become
1288333 a secure stable and independent state will have to protect each inch of land of iraq and foil any attempt to destroy its territorial integrity

1288418 they should exempt india from the requirement of comprehensive safeguards and add no other conditions

1288520 perfect love is rare indeed for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise the flexibility of the child the sensitivity of the artist the understanding of the philosopher the acceptance of the saint the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain
1288521 sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy or opposing passion each strives to be the other and both together make up one whole
1288522 the cure for all ills and wrongs the cares the sorrows and the crimes of humanity all lie in the one word love it is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life
1288523 we are all born for love it is the principle of existence and its only end
1288524 hay cinco derechos universales que son innegables al hombre a la raza humana uno es la vivienda otro es la ropa otro es la dignidad y en fin los otros dos se mhan olvidao
1288525 the tableegh of the present nizaam ud deen delhi the headquarters of the tableeghi jamaat according to my knowledge and understanding it is neither according to the quraan nor to the method of hazrat mujaddid alf thanee hazreat shaah waleeullaah muhaddith dehlawee or according to the scholars of the truth so the scholars who participate in this tableegh their first responsibility should be to conform this effort according to the quraan hadeeth to the way of the scholars of the salaf predecessors and the scholars of the truth
1288526 to this day i had been assuming that he maulana ehtishaam al hasan remained in khandelah because of his bad health and and due to which he abandoned his presence in nizaam ud deen and did not participate in the work of tableegh however from this important note i found out the reason for him not participating was because acording to him the work of tableegh is not necessary rather it is destroying the religion
1288527 maulana ehtishaam ul hasan is from the founders of this movement and very recently he has strongly refuted jamaat ut tableegh and said it is a group that calls to misguidance
1288528 however even i am hearing that some of the represenatatives khulafaa and hawaas of maulana thanwee do not like jamaat ut tableegh
1288529 the work that is for the people of knowledge the general people want to do
1288530 when the leader of a nation becomes bad then he only teaches a path of destruction to his people
1288531 i abdur raheem swear by allaah and say this tableegh i am doing is only due to a necessity and so i am excused by the people because since these youth have started their open sermons for which they do not have permision according to the shareeah and they have exceeded the bounds in regards to its virtue ie tableegh also they have openly hidden other aspects of the religion and after constant reminders by the superiors they were not stopped then in these situations the people with responsibility should make this open and public
1288532 considering the innovation non sunnah to be the sunnah is a blameworthy act of the creedal aspect i fall short in understanding how is it correct to rectify some actions of the people and yet turn a blind eye to defects in their beliefs as the correct beliefs are the means of salvation and not the actions
1288533 this mistake is quite common that in general gatherings people are encouraged to deliver lectures who are not worthy to do so sometimes these very same people are not even fully aware of the associated issues and so whilst speaking they do not even realise the limits of their knowledge so this is the reality of this and these mistakes occur frequently so it is upon the superiors to think and reflect upon this
1288534 one of the disatisfactions the maulana ashraf alee thanwee had was how will these people ie jamaat ut tableegh call the people to the importance of tableegh without knowledge so when the nephew of the maulana dhafar ahmad thanwee informed him that the speakers who deliver these lectures only speak about the issues they have been ordered to speak about and they do not speak about anything other than this so he maulana ashraf alee became satisfied
1288535 and we are seeing more commonly the people who travel for tableegh do not have knowledge and due to this the speakers speak about of all kinds of issues whilst mentioning stories and folk tales and in doing so most of them exceed the limits of theie knowledge
1288536 the present method of jamaat ut tableegh in cultivating the people upon the knowledge of islaam and of the various sciences is totally neglected
1288537 maulana dhafar ahmad did not at anytime consider joining and working with jamaat ut tableegh sufficient

1288544 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless

1288567 there is a younger generation who dont want to dope there has been a shift and a change of culture
1288568 one difference is that the riders are starting to self police and it is becoming unacceptable they are starting to point the finger at people that is quite a change from decades ago when doping was almost the norm
1288569 without a doubt there has been an impact the more tests there are the better we encourage that and anything we that can do to keep that going through these games and carrying on from there we will support it

1288697 its a rough subject in a multitude of ways enough people are doing it and theres a good measure of katrina burnout out there
1288698 so i thought that instead i might attempt to answer the question why why would people choose to live six feet below sea level why would anybody want to go back to that city after it was ruined what is it about new orleans that is in any way engaging
1288699 people are always interested to hear how we work together at the same table it looks like weve got duelling laptops set up
1288700 our approaches are different joseph is perfectly content to put it all on the page and not really look back until he finishes before he begins editing im a perpetual editor so ill spend numerous hours at the start of each day editing what i wrote the day before
1288701 peyton place really runs the gamut in terms of characters and in terms of classes and backgrounds
1288702 new orleans is a perfect place to set something like that simply because blocks like my fictional orchid st
1288703 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1288704 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1288705 he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1288706 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1288707 sure we have designed interactive sequences before but for things like museums and science exhibits
1288708 interactive technology has never been used in a touring environment before or in the rock show world
1288709 explaining the possibilities of the system and showing how we could create video content from audio input
1288710 he loved the fact that we were breaking new ground pushing the envelope in general he was extremely supportive but it was still quite a struggle to get it all right
1288711 there are so many parameters you have to worry about when dealing with nin
1288712 because they have such a precise and clearly defined visual aesthetic
1288713 is that the interactive material is self generated content rather than pre rendered material
1288714 in one interactive sequence trent moves towards the projection screens and a hollow opens around him but where that hollow is when it appears and how deep it goes all depends on what trent does at that individual performance
1288715 trent wanted to use the entire stage as a visual instrument that he could play
1288716 colours all look brighter when youre near the stars are all afire in the sky

1288727 i cant help it im an exhibitionist its a delicate balance
1288728 which is why you see a lot of people going down the tubes the difference for me is my kids 12 year old brandon and 10 year old dylan my kids probably saved my life
1288729 you come home from all that attention and the people following you around falling down trying to take your picture and there are your kids i hate you youre the worst mom ever why cant i have an ipod
1288730 theyre doing so great they really are the most amazing little people

1288740 i could not be more inappropriate to play him except i have the quality of being english
1288741 i think he would have liked me to be younger i hope when he sees the movie he feels hes respectable
1288742 i was staying at rideau hall and adrienne clarkson produced all these glorious wines
1288743 we were in one room her bodyguards were in another
1288744 she is an amazing woman canada ought to be very proud of her
1288745 youre in a beautiful place and i made a bunch of real friends
1288746 we had 24 hours in the rockies and then took a float plane to tofino and sooke harbour

1288750 el valencia siempre ha hecho proyectos serios e interesantes sabe que aqu estar bien porque es uno de los grandes de los mejores de la liga
1288751 l quiere quedarse en el valencia a partir de ah ya veremos qu es lo que pasa si surgen otras posibilidades ya las analizaremos pero de momento est muy a gusto aqu si en los pr ximos d as surge algo que no est en esta direcci n ya tendremos que valorarlo y entrar a tomar decisiones

1288754 theres about a three month period there that was very blurry to me i would lose it and take off on a bender for many days at a time
1288755 i became very negative and i really didnt care about anything
1288756 i really got out of the mode of trusting my instincts and i think a lot of that was because i was pretty messed up
1288757 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time

1288761 this exciting new deal with total broadcast consultants will assist our continuing expansion into europe with tielines growth in sales in the republic of ireland it is important for broadcasters to be serviced by a local dealer who is familiar with their unique market needs
1288762 the team at total broadcast consultants has decades of experience in all facets of radio engineering they have designed and built fully digital radio facilities from the ground up and are well placed to advise customers about integrating codec technologies
1288763 this will be especially useful as broadcasters in ireland continue to migrate to 3g and ip networks ip proliferation is still gathering momentum but european broadcasters appreciate the cost advantages of ip over isdn and the flexibility that the technology provides
1288764 preco broadcast systems who have been working with us for the last ten years will continue to service our customers in england scotland wales northern ireland and france they have a local presence in these markets and are partnering tieline as the demand for flexible and reliable ip codecs grows exponentially
1288765 tieline is committed to developing new ip and 3gip applications that take advantage of new network infrastructures around the globe alliances with new partners such as total broadcast consultants will assist broadcasters as they transition into new ip technologies

1288767 bass exposed to high fluoxetine concentrations were observed maintaining their position at the top of the water surface rather than the bottom of the tank like control bass sometimes with their dorsal fin out of the water
1288768 they were also noted to maintain a vertical position in the aquaria these behaviors persisted throughout both the exposure and recovery periods
1288769 this conclusion has significant implications for the species conservation especially given an estimate of an effective population size of only 8200 individuals globally and its iucn status as vulnerable
1288770 despite protective legislation the numbers in the northeast atlantic may show only limited recovery if mature adults are exposed to exploitation in other oceanic regions
1288771 this court will not substitute its judgment for that of congress by reading into the statute a time limit that is not included in the plain language of the statute
1288772 the very right denied them as a result of the final deportation orders the right to be at large in the united states
1288773 the relief they seek is indistinguishable from a request to be readmitted to this country
1288774 non person to permit such imprisonment most assuredly shocks my conscience
1288775 and our constitution protects all persons from deprivation of life liberty and property the two judge majority fundamentally misconstrued the constitutional issues presented in this case
1288776 anybody in the united states subject to government power is entitled to the protection of the constitution
1288777 the conclusion that there are people in this country who can be arbitrarily detained indefinitely on the theory that they have no rights is inconsistent with developments in due process law over the last century
1288778 this makes it harder for us to hold other countries accountable for jailing people indefinitely when we give people in our country the back of the hand
1288779 the fact that youve got two circuit courts that have basically upheld that the law is constitutional is certainly significant
1288780 but it does not resolve finally resolve the issue and it may be that ultimately you will need a supreme court decision given the varying district court rulings
1288781 detention is a crucial component of our overall enforcement effort
1288782 the greater our capacity to detain the greater our ability to return credibility to the nations immigration laws

1288786 this is the first time we have successfully bred short snouted seahorses here and for so many to have been born is fantastic
1288787 but were keeping our fingers crossed that many of the babies will survive into adulthood and help boost the captive bred populations of these endangered and beautiful fish
1288788 the threats to coral reefs all over the world were already extreme and they now have to deal with this alien predator in the atlantic
1288789 weve observed that they feed in a way that no atlantic ocean fish has ever encountered native fish literally dont know what hit them
1288790 we have to figure out something to do about this invasion before it causes a major crisis
1288791 we basically had to abandon some studies we had under way in the atlantic on population dynamics of coral reef fish because the lionfish had moved in and were eating everything
1288792 im not going to bow to political correctness im going to do it with humor im going to focus on the issues im going to react to what he says simple
1288793 the most dangerous guy we have to deal with on the right
1288794 its very clear we want a quality school but we dont want to spend peoples hard earned money in a poor way so it is important to maximize the space in the school
1288795 within that discussion needs to be consideration of programs needed as well as cost and utilization of the area
1288796 i thought we were the only one but i learned there is one in florida
1288797 well go from being able to house 24 animals to about 60 and well now have an overnight room the people can stay with their pets they used to sit on the floor in front of the cage we wont have to turn anyone away not that we would wed find room but this will be less stressful for the pets
1288798 wed have teens come in to feed and brush a specific animal
1288799 the experience of having someone care just for them that contact tends to improve the animals recovery time
1288800 not yet sure which way were going but we have the legal right to appeal the decision to the supreme court of maine or file a motion for reconsideration of the commissions action we also have the right to sue cmp on land use and easement issues
1288801 theyve had them before and they either expire or dont get renewed by the judge
1288802 this is a long ongoing property dispute between the two and it has been in the courts for a long time

1288805 willow creek had been doing this conference for about 12 years and about eight years ago started adding satellites
1288806 they used to have it in chicago but could only fit 4 000 people we were chosen because we were willing to do it it involves some work on our part and some expense willow wants every site to have the same experience so we must set up with a willow creek conference atmosphere
1288807 because the screen is so large you feel like youre right there if we were in chicago the seats would be in an auditorium many find the smaller setting to be more beneficial
1288808 the cost for the summit is about 250 but as a host site our people only pay 75
1288809 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this

1288812 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1288813 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
1288814 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
1288815 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
1288816 i decided then that youd probably grow up to be a tactful diplomatic person

1288829 o ur analysis indicates that the extinction risk for many corals is now much greater than it was before recent massive bleaching events
1288830 if bleaching events become very frequent many species may be unable to reestablish breeding populations before subsequent bleaching causes potentially irreversible declines perhaps mimicking conditions that led to previous coral extinctions
1288831 if corals cannot adapt the cascading effects of the functional loss of reef ecosystems will threaten the geologic structure of reefs and their coastal protection function and have huge economic effects on food security for hundreds of millions of people dependent on reef fish
1288832 our consensus view is that the loss of reef ecosystems would lead to large scale loss of global biodiversity

1288856 the old right and left thinking is often an ideological straight jacket
1288857 we believe unapologetically in the power of market forces as the most efficient and effective means of generating economic prosperity just as we also believe in the public goods that constitute the pre conditions for a market economy to perform efficiently and effectively

1288859 we believe in a compassionate society not through episodes of private philanthropic endeavour but through the actions of the state
1288860 to allow social institutions such as the family to fend entirely for themselves against unrestrained market forces
1288861 and the challenges of policy innovation and solving complex problems often arise from the nuts and bolts questions such as how we

1288864 theres a lot going into it and its expensive i think its good for teachers and at some point it could be good for the city
1288865 i believe a budget is something that is supposed to be achieved
1288866 it sets a precedent for the rest of the contracts going forward its rather unfair to the public
1288867 i think it drives us in the direction of incentive rather than seniority and i think that takes a lot of courage
1288868 my second daughter was born in china and we adopted her at 13 months
1288869 its such an easy fix for us and these kids will succeed

1288894 con actuaciones como sta se demuestra la grandeza del club ahora damos un paso m s y ayudamos a luchar contra la malaria un problema terrible
1288895 es muy triste escuchar lo que pasa con esta enfermedad
1288896 cuando llega un nuevo entrenador todos los jugadores se hacen preguntas en su cabeza y quieren mostrar sus mejores cualidades para impresionarlo
1288897 es el club del pueblo es el latido de la ciudad
1288898 el real tiene un objetivo la liga de campeones yo puedo ayudar lo importante es que juegue luchar por tener un puesto en el equipo pero el real tiene muchas estrellas y si acabase en el banquillo no ser a un problema
1288899 todos vimos lo que le ha pasado a wesleu sneijder algo as puede ocurrir siempre y s lo era un amistoso
1288900 that was the best ive ever seen him pitch we played as good a defense as we had all year and thats what you need to do behind chris catcher tyler poisson called a terrific game
1288901 tebo pitched well he didnt throw too many pitches and he kept us off balance
1288902 the first four innings we swung at a lot of first pitches the last five innings was a better effort
1288903 tebo is not going to strike out many guys he just pitched to contact all night long
1288904 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix
1288905 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seems a little bit less severe
1288906 were kind of going through a period of healing and trying to maybe etch out some kind of bottom
1288907 a lot of times you just dont reach a bottom and go straight up
1288908 out of all the races i have ever done this one was the nicest
1288909 ive won it plenty of times i will just go into it and shoot the best score that i can thats all i can do
1288910 sometimes it comes down to luck to determine these championships
1288911 you hit a good shot when somebody makes a bad shot sometimes you just happen to put a couple of good holes together and it gives you a lot of momentum where someone else is having a rough game you just never know
1288912 i think whats happened over the years is that a lot of girls that come through college and had a little bit of success turn pro
1288913 its a shame because youve lost a lot of good players who havent done much with their game some people try to make a career out of it but once they turn pro they think they can make it on tour and they cant once they do that they dont play golf anymore
1288914 instead of using their college education to make a living a lot of these girls turn to golf
1288915 thats why we have lost so many amateur players we could have a lot more amateur players and the league could be stronger
1288916 testing the waters a guide to water quality at vacation beaches
1288917 we have a beautiful beach i told my staff the other day the good news that we got this recognition i then told them the other news is that we have to work even harder to ensure that we retain our five star rating and that hampton beach continues to be one of the best beaches around
1288918 we went through that last year in atlanta with michael vick the media and on tv and people outside may think its a distraction but us as players weve got to come out here and practice were not talking about that on the practice field
1288919 each person who has a job being focused to do it so everybody else can depend on him and they are accountable for it

1288922 has had a lot of different responsibilities for us in the kicking game playing both corner and safety defensively
1288923 hes got good experience in a couple different systems so i dont think anything he is doing here is anything that new
1288924 he shows up with a play or two every day and he is a hard working guy
1288925 it was pretty tough because you couldnt get a hold of anyone back there
1288926 that was probably the hardest thing not knowing for like four or five hours not knowing anything and just doing a lot of praying
1288927 eventually he got hold of my mother and then they called me

1289020 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1289021 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1289022 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime

1289162 i regret tony snow s death just as i regretted lee atwater s death
1289163 look for the new york people to make real inroads here with their national edition
1289164 i don t remember the news media making improper and tasteless remarks about the deaths
1289165 occurs when a person lacks another s superior quality achievement or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it
1289166 love of ones own good perverted to a desire to deprive other men of theirs
1289167 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another
1289168 he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings
1289169 mccain indeed offers exactly no numbers no tangible path to his stated goal of a balanced budget worse his choice of issues only reveals how clueless he continues
1289170 exactly the same program not one damn bit of difference
1289171 folks i know who are hardline and well connected likudniks think obama is more likely to attack iran than mccain
1289172 barack obama called on tuesday for changing federal bankruptcy laws to help military families seniors and victims of natural disasters and accused john mccain of repeatedly siding with the banking industry when congress acted on the issue

1289179 the average time a reader of the new york times spends with the printed paper is about 45 minutes the average time a viewer spends on the new york times web site is about seven minutes there is a difference between browsing and reading and the web is built for browsing rather than for reading
1289180 i admit it the liberal media were never that powerful and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures
1289181 there can be much less serendipitous exposure to new events and perspectives on the web that you get leafing through a newspaper instead people are prone to retreating into ideological echo chambers
1289182 there is some strategy to it bashing the media as liberal if you watch any great coach what they try to do is work the refs maybe the ref will cut you a little slack on the next one
1289183 there were days and times and events we might have had some complaints but on balance i dont think we have had anything to complain about
1289184 ive gotten balanced coverage and broad coverage all we could have asked for heaven sakes we kid about the liberal media but every republican on earth does that
1289185 at the end of the day there is no credible definition of where the political center actually is so talk about bias is missing the point
1289186 we live under the happy illusion that we can transfer news gathering to the internet
1289187 well he s right about the happy part news alerady has come to the internet where it is faster more complete more global with more voices
1289188 have the prices of tires risen in real terms since 2003
1289189 maybe at the moment but real soon now thatll change because internet advertising in internet news sources features great bang for the buck right isnt it just a matter of newspapers figuring it out
1289190 overall companies will spend 61 8 of their online budgets on their own web sites for a total of 65 1 billion this partly reflects a shortage of online ad inventory but may also signal dissatisfaction with the advertising and marketing services offered by online publishers
1289191 indeed 75 of advertisers ranked their own web sites as the most effective means of lead generation ahead of exhibitions at 66 custom pubs at 65 and direct mail and trade magazines both at 64
1289192 who knows not me and almost as certainly not you either
1289193 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1289194 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1289195 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1289196 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
1289197 what the mccain campaign doesn t want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch
1289198 the guy s a phony utterly lacking in integrity with
1289199 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
1289200 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1289201 i dont particularly want to be held responsible for what my granddaddy did either
1289202 i dont want any part of our conversation to be improper
1289203 joe klein is still wrong about one thing mccain s stubborn insistence that the surge would work
1289204 but mob connections this sort of desperate guilt by association only makes obama s supporters look more like mccain s
1289205 we just got off a conference call with camp mccain defending their new ad comparing barack obama to paris hilton and britney spears
1289206 they said they thought the ad was legitimate because obama is a big celebrity which happens to be what john mccain was too when he came home from vietnam and started to build his political career and britney and paris were number 2 and 3
1289207 the problem anyone with even a vague sense of pop culture knows that britney and paris are yesterdays news heres a link to forbes celebrity 100 paris and britney dont even make the list any more
1289208 instead the top 10 in order oprah winfrey tiger woods angelina jolie beyonce knowles david beckham johnny depp jay z the police jk rowling brad pitt
1289209 so they didnt pick other big celebrities who were either men or black or married
1289210 new york ap republican sen john mccain said he will officially enter the presidential race with a formal announcement in early april after a trip to iraq
1289211 the arizona senator discussed the timing of the long expected announcement with reporters at an awards reception wednesday evening a few hours after taping an appearance on cbs
1289212 a political celebrity mccain is considered a top contender for the nomination
1289213 is this all theyve got is this what america deserves
1289214 is it a greater liability to be the candidate of the ruling party or to be black period everything else is white noise quite literally
1289215 you might say nothing could be more unsurprising than a panel of political pundits admitting the obvious that barack obama is playing the race card when he accuses john mccain of saying the dem candidate
1289216 fox friends and yes hardball with barnicle in particular makes me fear for the country
1289217 the only person in this presidential race who was ever sucked into a horrible race accusation was john mccain in 2000 in south carolina
1289218 as it stands obama leads by only single digits in a lot of places
1289219 some seem worried that obama looking good to a german crowd will alienate americans
1289220 beautify this place prepared by the ascended masters for millions of seekers the place where the messenger elizabeth clare prophet stood and delivered the word for the aquarian age
1289221 its important to have a beautiful environment and to blend with montana
1289222 and for visitors to have a nice place to gather when they come here from all over the world
1289223 the young people like to help set up and take down the tents for the conference

1289226 this chandelier was in our malibu california headquarters so theres history here as well as the new
1289227 are enlightened spiritual beings who once lived on the earth and over the course of many lifetimes of devotion and striving they fulfilled their mission for being their divine plan and ascended back to their divine source reuniting with spirit
1289228 the underground structure is being assessed at 50 percent of the value
1289229 all remaining structures are being assessed at 100 percent of their value however the chapel old montessori school and three log cabins are exempt
1289230 were moving forward based on universal and time tested tenants helping our congregants achieve their spiritual path
1289231 church universal and triumphant is a cult that has now survived past its founding generation though the organization faltered for a few years it now seems to have stabilized and shows no signs of disintegrating as long as there are people who need the particular brand of ascended masters teachings my parents offered their successors will continue to propagate their messianic zeal
1289232 the new chapel is a meeting house for the community to give them a place to go they raised 2 million for that but that doesnt hide the fact they spent 20 million on shelters for nothing they ruined a lot of peoples dreams
1289233 its all about the money buildings and who gains the most
1289234 there are steel trap doors in the floor near the altar they may have covered it up
1289235 the spiritual center of the ranch we take the young people on wildlife hikes up there the bears and mountain lions are doing very well so we keep everyone together
1289236 because his visit is official only senator obama may not be accompanied by members of his campaign staff
1289237 he may only be accompanied by one member of his senate staff and the appropriate number of security personnel
1289238 while at lrmc landstuhl regional medical center senator obama may not address the media to make a campaign or election related statement or to respond to a campaign or a campaign related event
1289239 suppose he could win big but if all those skills haven t put him ahead by more at this point what makes everyone woody bob and gm excluded so sure of a landslide i see him winning a pretty close race
1289240 but i am a world citizen and what you do will affect us if we see that the u s is changing its good for all of us
1289241 we french have the confused feeling that he is the living resurrection of the two greatest heroes in our eyes of modern america martin luther king and john kennedy
1289242 the army refuted the accuracy of the account of the obama visit these comments are inappropriate and factually incorrect bagram spokesman lt col rumi nielson green told the new york daily news
1289243 aren t you guys ever embarrassed by the crap you sling here
1289244 i think the president should have stood by his word and that meant karl should have left
1289245 i heard just yesterday that the loon faction was agitating to take down the station repeater near malibu because it serves mostly the wealthy
1289246 that will continue but eventually there will be a model whereby readers will pay for the good stuff and i m confident americans on average know what the good stuff is and will be willing to pay for it once the finally learn that they have to or go without it
1289247 u n inspectors had documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1289248 yeah we liberals hated vaclav havel alexander solzhenitysn andrei sakharov lech walesa and the students in tianamen square

1289250 reagan as candidate and president was conservatism with a happy face helms is conservatism with a stiffened spine reagans success as a conservative leader however wouldnt have happened without helmss bracing him the republican party needs another duo like that whats missing obviously is a new reagan helms is still here operating at full tilt
1289251 reagan s success as a conservative leader however wouldn t have happened without helms s bracing him
1289252 that s the democrat s strategy for helping working families and the children
1289253 he used the posts to protect his states tobacco growers and other farmers and placed his stamp on foreign policy with a strident opposition to communism
1289254 reagan s success as a conservative leader however wouldn t have happened without helms s bracing him
1289255 in 1976 jesse helms then the junior senator first helped persuade reagan to seek the presidency and then engineered a stunning come from behind victory for reagan in north carolina
1289256 the second most important conservative of the second half of the 20th century
1289257 it tended to cloud u s policy in the eyes of americans and chileans as well
1289258 if you want to jump in the sewer with woody and defend jesse helms i ll be happy to speak truth to your nonsense
1289259 i m not a fan of extreme know it alls like helms on the right or the left

1289274 i m betting on a bold statement that washington dc is the eternal undivided capital of israel
1289275 a strong streak of agrarian and labor populism at the turn of the century
1289276 it s time for us to get god damn pugnacious about the economy and give the republicans and their plutocrat friends a bloody god damn nose

1289281 i wont just ask for your vote as a candidate i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states
1289282 this will not be a call issued in one speech or one program this will be a central cause of my presidency
1289283 the press should be hypercritical of obama s pandering to the right
1289284 he s already revised his remarks on clark maybe fisa is next
1289285 the new york daily news has a new twist in the administrations attempt to peg the anthrax attacks to its own bellicose aims

1289292 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1289293 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1289294 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1289295 the houses working committee should reconsider this proposal because the dsku has been doing a good job
1289296 most dsku employees are only qualified to handle jobs related to small and medium sized airplanes
1289297 those staff members will work here for two years in the meantime we will train our own staff on how to supervise and monitor large airplanes
1289298 we will give them incentives to a total of rp 100 billion us 10 8 million in the form of more lucrative remuneration packages and performance based bonuses

1289310 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1289311 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1289312 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1289313 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1289314 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1289315 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over
1289316 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1289317 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1289318 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1289341 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
1289342 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time
1289343 ironisnya si pasien itu sendiri diduga memilih operasi caesar yang tak seharusnya tanpa indikasi kesehatan atau medis karena sosialisasi yang keliru
1289344 di indonesia sendiri persentase operasi caesar sekitar 5 di rumah sakit pemerintah rata rata 11 sementara di rumah sakit swasta bisa lebih dari 30
1289345 american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog perkumpulan ahli obstetrik dan ginekologi di amerika telah memberikan peraturan untuk para anggotanya yakni untuk sebuah operasi caesar mereka harus menunjukkan pada pasien bukan saja prosedur operasi tapi juga harus menjelaskan bahwa operasi caesar lebih berisiko untuk ibu dan bayinya dibandingkan dengan persalinan normal
1289346 mereka lalu menangkap bagian yang menyenangkan dari cerita ini tanpa disertai pengetahuan mengenai rasa sakit yang lama setelah operasi berbagai risiko yang dapat timbul akibat operasi maupun proses pemulihan pascaoperasi yang lama dengan sosialisasi keliru semacam itu ditambah dengan semakin banyaknya wanita muda yang menjalani operasi caesar maka seolah olah operasi menjadi sebuah jalan keluar bagi kekhawatiran mereka
1289347 padahal dengan sayatan sejajar dengan garis perut dan kondisi kehamilan setelahnya yang baik persalinan berikutnya tak selalu harus melalui operasi juga mungkin saja pada persalinan pertama terjadi plasenta previa atau terjadi persalinan macet sementara pada kehamilan kedua kondisinya baik baik saja sehingga persalinan normal bisa dilakukan
1289348 bila tidak ada keadaan gawat dan indikasi untuk operasi maka tindakan operasi tidak sesuai dengan kode etik kedokteran dokter juga seharusnya memberikan penjelasan pada pasien mengenai risiko operasi caesar yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan persalinan normal
1289349 bahkan ada yang melaporkan pada kami bahwa ada paket yang menawarkan operasi caesar sekalian operasi usus buntu padahal menurut kode etik kedokteran kedua operasi tersebut tak perlu dilakukan apalagi sekaligus jika tak ada indikasi kesehatan
1289350 jika ada indikasi untuk operasi pun dokter harus menjelaskan mengenai penyakitnya alternatif pengobatannya serta apa alasan si ibu harus menjalani operasi

1289386 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
1289387 olympiacos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league
1289388 the team has some good players a well known coach and fanatical supporters which always inspires them
1289389 the brazil international is coming to greece on tuesday afternoon and he will sign a three year contract
1289390 he has played at the highest level for many years and is someone i feel could do a good job for us
1289391 hes got bags of experience and could come into the club and really help our younger players but we havent got that far down the line yet
1289392 it is fantastic news for this football club in what is a very big season for us
1289393 pablo and owen are very important players for us and its a sign of the confidence they have in ipswich town that they have committed their futures here for another three years
1289394 they are ambitious players and want to be playing in the premier league and they have a part to play in helping us get there
1289395 signing owen and pablo on long term deals is also a sign of the ambitions we have here we are no longer in a position where we have to sell our best players
1289396 there was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but im still here and im happy with that
1289397 it is not a problem for me to stay here and thats what people have to understand
1289398 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you
1289399 to me there is no point when i have all that at celtic im really happy in my football and in my life right now
1289400 i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good
1289401 the aim for this season is simple win the title again for the fourth season and then do better in the champions league
1289402 i am extremely pleased to have signed for such an ambitious club such as cardiff city
1289403 i was very impressed by the plans laid down by the chairman and manager of this club

1289409 sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like
1289410 thats just the way it is but this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football good quality and exciting football
1289411 its the responsibility of all the players to play exciting football but im more than happy to assume that role ill take on the role of making the football exciting very happily
1289412 i think stephen is a bit disappointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll

1289415 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1289416 you play against quality players in the premier league but europe will be different again
1289417 if i can play a bit in europe this season hopefully it will help me stay in the england squad and that i can win the first cap ashley young has had his first caps and i would love the same if i can impress the coach

1289429 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1289430 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1289431 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1289432 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1289433 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1289434 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1289435 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1289436 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1289437 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear

1289456 love is handing your heart to someone and taking the risk that they will hand it back because they dont want it thats why its such a cruching ache on the inside we gave away a part of ourselves and it wasnt wanted love is a giving away of power when we love we give the other person the power in the relationship they can do what they choose they can do what they like with our love they can reject it they can accpet it they can step toward us in gratitude and appreciation love is a giving away when we love we put ourselves out there we expose ourselves we allow ourselves to vulnerable love is giving up control its surrendering the desire to control the other person the two love and controlling power over the other person are mutually exclusice if we are serious about loving someoen we have to surrender all of the desires within us to manipulate the relationship

1289468 for i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the songs of god for the creation was subjected to futility not willingly but because of him who subjected it in hope because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now not only that but we also who have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves eagerly waiting for the adoption the redemption of our body for we are saved in this hope but hope that is seen is not hope for why does one still hope for what he sees but if we hope for what we do not see we eagerly wait for it with perseverance likewise the spirit also helps in our weaknesses for we do not know what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit himself makes intercession for us with the groanings which cannot be uttered now he who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the spirit is because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to those who love god to those who are the called according to his purpose
1289469 therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace so that the promise might be sure to all the seed not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all in the presence of him whom he believed god who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did who contrary to hope in hope believed so that he became the father of many nations according to what was spoken and not being weak in faith he did not consider his own body already dead he did not waver at the promise of god through unbelief but was strengthened in faith giving glory to god and being fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to perform and therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness now it was written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but also for us it shall be imputed to us who believe in him who raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered up because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification therefore having been justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only that but we also glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope now hope does not disappoint because the love of god has been poured out in our hearts by the holy spirit who was given to us for when we were still without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
1289470 so the lord gave to israel all the land of which he had sworn to give to their fathers and they took possession of it and dwelt in it the lord gave them rest all around according to all that he had sworn to their fathers and not a man of all their enemies stood against them the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand not a word failed of any good thing which the lord had spoken to the house of israel all came to pass
1289471 through the lords mercies we are not consumed because his compassions fail not
1289472 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh my enemies and foes they stumbled and fell though an army may encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war may ride against me in this i will be confident one thing i have desired of the lord that i will seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set my high up on a rock and now my heard shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me therefore i will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle i will sing yes i will sing praises to the lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when you said seek my face my heart said to you your face lord i will seek do not hide your face from me do not turn your servant away in anger you have been my help do not leave me nor forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take care of me teach me your way o lord and leas me in a smooth path because of my enemies do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries for false witnesses have risen against me and such as breathe out violence i would have lost heart unless i had believed that i would see the goodness of the lord in the land o the living wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart wait i say wait on the lord
1289473 for a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin real life but there was always some obstacle in the way something to be gotten through first some unfinished business time still to be served a debt to be paid at least it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life this perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness happiness is the way so treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one happiness is a journey not a destination

1289551 es ist dies die aufhebung der kapitalistischen produktionsweise innerhalb der kapitalistischen produktionsweise selbst und daher ein sich selbst aufhebender widerspruch der auf den ersten blick als blo er bergangspunkt zu einer neuen produktionsform sich darstellt es ist privatproduktion ohne die kontrolle des privateigentums
1289552 wir anerkennen die kooperativbewegung als eine der triebkr fte zur umwandlung der gegenw rtigen gesellschaft die auf klassengegens tzen beruht ihr gro es verdienst besteht darin praktisch zu zeigen dass das bestehende despotische und armut hervorbringende system der unterjochung der arbeit unter das kapital verdr ngt werden kann durch das republikanische und segensreiche system der assoziation von freien und gleichen produzenten
1289553 die lohnsteigerungen sind daher auch kein verdienst der arbeiterbewegung sonder ergeben sich aus angebot und nachfrage

1289569 it is just because it is so close to the olympics
1289570 but dont worry this doesnt affect ordinary people like you and me
1289571 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
1289572 do you really think that being more responsible with our resources will cripple the economy
1289573 how changes to beliefs about climate change occur when consumers read information supplied by the news media
1289574 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

1289577 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1289578 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1289579 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1289580 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1289581 we will not back down we will not slow down we are in this for the long haul
1289582 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd
1289583 i salute him for that challenge it is absolutely possible to do so
1289584 i think nuclear will play a role i dont think it will be a large increase
1289585 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1289586 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1289587 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1289588 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1289589 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1289590 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1289591 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1289592 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1289593 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1289594 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1289595 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1289596 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1289597 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1289598 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1289599 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1289600 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1289601 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1289602 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1289603 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1289604 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1289605 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1289606 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1289607 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1289608 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1289609 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1289610 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1289611 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1289612 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1289613 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1289614 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1289615 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1289616 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1289617 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1289618 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1289619 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1289620 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1289621 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1289622 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1289623 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1289624 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1289625 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1289626 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1289627 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1289628 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1289629 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1289630 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1289631 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1289632 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1289633 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1289634 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1289635 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1289636 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1289637 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1289638 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1289639 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1289640 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1289641 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1289642 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1289643 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1289644 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1289645 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1289646 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1289647 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1289648 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1289649 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1289650 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1289651 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1289652 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1289653 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1289654 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1289655 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1289656 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1289657 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1289658 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1289659 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1289660 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1289661 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again
1289662 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1289663 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1289664 that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1289665 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1289666 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1289667 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc
1289668 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1289669 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1289670 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1289671 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1289672 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1289673 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1289674 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1289675 unlike obama in illinois sen hillary clinton voted to support the 2002 federal bill
1289676 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1289677 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1289678 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1289679 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1289680 the congress doing nothing decided to go on a five week recess said mccain
1289681 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1289682 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1289683 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1289684 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1289685 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1289686 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1289687 no hibernate session bound to thread and configuration does not allow creation of non transactional one here
1289688 my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness
1289689 therefore most gladly i will rather boast in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me
1289690 theyre able to give them a visual so the students get some idea of what is really professional
1289691 many believe they can only wear a dark suit and a white shirt this gives them some options
1289692 theres no selling but it does introduce the name to the youngest generation
1289693 what would be one persons hysteria is another persons genuine belief
1289694 i dont necessarily think theres a difference between false beliefs and true beliefs in the way people behave
1289695 any belief true or false which causes people to move in threatening directions causes adverse consequences
1289696 one of the concepts underlying mass hysteria is the idea that emotions can be contagious
1289697 brain imaging studies have shown that the emotions that we experience from other people can actually have a direct impact on our brains
1289698 for example if you show a person a fearful face the fearful face itself will activate the amygdala in your own brain thereby setting off the fear circuits in your brain
1289699 so you can imagine in a crowd all it takes is for a few people to have fearful faces to set off the fear circuits in the brains of other people
1289700 there was an altercation between the blonsky family and the golden family
1289701 i think the rule on saving seats is that people need to be reasonable
1289702 there is no formula for how many saved seats make it ok it doesnt matter if its one or three or five you cant make a formula based on the size of the room and the number of available seats
1289703 i could almost hear a silent echo of amen resonate from the very walls of the cinema hall
1289704 movie review the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor 3 10
1289705 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1289706 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1289707 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1289708 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1289709 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1289710 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1289711 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1289712 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1289713 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1289714 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1289715 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1289716 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1289717 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1289718 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
1289719 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
1289720 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
1289721 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
1289722 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
1289723 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1289724 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
1289725 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1289726 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
1289727 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1289728 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1289729 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1289730 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1289731 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1289732 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1289733 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1289734 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1289735 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1289736 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1289737 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1289738 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1289739 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again

1289762 to hell with reality i want to die in music not in reason or in prose people dont deserve the restraint we show by not going into delirium in front of them to hell with them
1289763 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process
1289764 sets a precedent of permitting our court to micro manage trial procedures established by the district courts
1289765 requiring district courts to bow to media demands to know the names of prospective jurors would certainly impair the public good in many cases
1289766 right to be free from double jeopardy mandates that a district judge exercise scrupulous and extraordinary care to be certain that there is no alternative to a mistrial
1289767 give the defendant an opportunity to dissuade a judge from granting a mistrial even when doing so would not be an abuse of discretion
1289768 you know its not about you its about your country
1289769 i havent had a chance to speak to craig myself i was made aware of it after the game as i was in the players tunnel an official from ipswich made me aware something had happened

1289775 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1289776 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1289777 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1289778 we were not as clear as we might have been
1289779 i am presently minded to give judgement in about a months time on the 12th of september
1289780 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1289781 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1289782 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1289783 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1289784 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1289785 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming

1289790 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1289791 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

1289807 you have to watch out for that old trickster by the fancy gate thats the devil and those arent the gates to heaven but the gates to hell this here is heaven
1289808 you dont think that i would create a creature as magnificent and loving as a dog and then ask you to abandon him in order to enter my kingdom do you thats just a last test for you any man who would abandon his dog isnt welcome in heaven
1289809 im a huge sports fanatic and have always wanted to go to the games and be involved in such a worldly monumental event
1289810 during the 2004 athens games we realized our mutual obsession with all things olympics the events bob costas the commercials the today shows broadcast
1289811 we decided to make it our goal to attend the 2008 games
1289812 the most difficult part was probably figuring out what to do about accommodations
1289813 we could not afford 600 a night at a hotel
1289814 we found a very nice 35 year old guy who along with his wife were going to rent out the second floor of their beijing apartment
1289815 and by staying with the locals we think our experience in the country will only be enhanced
1289816 im not looking forward to my credit card bill when we get back
1289817 we think the olympics will be the ultimate sports experience and we cant wait
1289818 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1289819 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1289820 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1289821 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1289822 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1289823 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
1289824 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success

1289827 ambulance demand increases at between three and six per cent a year on average
1289828 last year was in line with that although there was a bigger increase the year before
1289829 its likely to continue going up although its difficult to say why nothing leaps out of the statistics as a particularly strong factor
1289830 we just have to keep on increasing staff levels and improving the way we respond to calls thats why we categorise calls as emergency urgent or routine to make sure those who need help most get it quickest
1289831 i think it is a throwback to when people were not sure about nhs24 it works well but some people still do not want to phone it
1289832 theres no reason for there to be an increase maybe at weekends it is also due to escalating levels of binge drinking
1289833 i just wonder how much of this rise is abuse either from binge drinking or not calling nhs24
1289834 this needs to be investigated but a 50 per cent rise is horrendous
1289835 justice department officials expressed the view that it would be inappropriate to have separate firearms laws in scotland or indeed among individual local authority bylaws within scotland
1289836 considering the fact that firearms legislation is a matter reserved to westminster and that recent legislation from the parliament has recently been enacted it is most unlikely that a city of edinburgh promoted bylaw seeking to ban the sale and use of airguns in the city would have any prospect of being confirmed
1289837 even if such a bylaw were to be enacted lothian and borders police are clearly sceptical about the enforcement of a bylaw within the city particularly when no such similar bylaw exists in neighbouring authorities covered by the police force
1289838 a local ban would go someway towards helping but it would be easier to tackle this nationally
1289839 the justice secretary has made clear that he believes it is time for the comprehensive review of our firearms controls and laws we will continue to press the uk government to either act or devolve the powers to let the scottish government act
1289840 following advice from the security services last year the spcb reported to parliament that it would be taking steps to improve its perimeter security it would be counterproductive at this stage to discuss the detail of the installation of additional security measures
1289841 they talk about tailgating but who exactly is it that they dont want in to the parliament
1289842 i think if they conducted a poll on the street they wouldnt find one person who wanted to get in there
1289843 it will be interesting to see what the cost of this will be
1289844 i dont know why they feel this is needed but i suppose the corporate body have to have something to do and if nothing else they are often a source of innocent if expensive amusement
1289845 i received two leaflets last friday one telling me that from august 11 i should put my bin out on a monday and another telling me to put my rubbish out on a thursday from august 14
1289846 so i phoned up the council and the woman told me she didnt know which was the right day
1289847 the council just doesnt seem to be able to organise this and what a waste of money its been sending out all these leaflets
1289848 we have been distributing leaflets to 35 000 households informing them of any changes to their refuse collection days unfortunately there have been one or two minor glitches with the distribution process affecting a small number of households
1289849 anyone seeking further advice or information is urged to contact us on 0131 529 3030 or e mail waste customerservices edinburgh gov uk
1289850 a laser doppler scanner would allow very accurate and speedy assessment of the depth of thermal injury
1289851 this will allow us to treat individual burns with a far greater degree of precision and allow us to determine the best treatment very early after injury we are very keen to add this equipment to our department it will allow us to predict much more accurately the likelihood that a burn wound will or will not heal inevitably this will avoid surgery in some patients speed up surgery in others and minimise unnecessary scarring and its consequences in all partial thickness burn patients in doing so it will also save money otherwise spent on avoidable operations and scar management
1289852 we feel our objections have been ignored these shops attract drunken disorderly behaviour violence and litter maybe it wasnt viable as a newsagent but there are too many of these food outlets already we have already lost a large number of shops in the old town
1289853 local residents are already fed up with all the noise in the area and this could only make it worse these late night food outlets can be even worse than pubs as they are more difficult to police
1289854 i have spoken to all the neighbours and they also expressed concern as the cowgate is busy enough in the early hours with pub and club revellers without the need for a fast food outlet adding to the general chaos
1289855 my bedroom is directly above the shop and i feel that the smell from cooking will be unbearable
1289856 the proposal will not lead to an unacceptable increase in noise on street activity or antisocial behaviour
1289857 there is not an excessive concentration of hot food takeaways in the immediate vicinity
1289858 it gives you an indication of where some old people are
1289859 we are quite close to stockbridge house and used it many years ago for christmas parties
1289860 we encourage the children to take part in citizenship working with the community and this will set a great example to the older ones we will explain why we are doing this and what it is all about
1289861 we will get the children to take the money round which will be nice for them and will give them a chance to meet the people they are helping and hear their stories
1289862 the members will be delighted some of them were really upset about it last week
1289863 they knew it was on the cards we told them many weeks in advance but for some its a lifeline and they will be lost without it
1289864 its lovely that the nursery have agreed to do this
1289865 i think this is a wonderful gesture the youngest generation helping out the oldest generation im so impressed by the nursery i cannot promise anything at this stage it is something i will have to run past board members
1289866 we basically collect the blood into a small version of the human blood donation bag with dogs and with humans the blood gets broken down into components such as plasma and red blood cells that get separated so they can be stored but its hard to do that with cats because the bags are much smaller
1289867 its used for cats that are anaemic and occasionally we see cats who have had rat poison or have coagulating difficulties like haemophilia and cats that arent producing enough blood cells
1289868 hes no problem at all hes quite relaxed they give us a call and say we need dennis and within half an hour were there
1289869 afterwards hes fine he gets a bag of food for doing it and hes quite content
1289870 as always with unusual incidents at plays no one is quite sure if its part of the show or not although it advertisement became clear pretty quickly afterwards that it wasnt the adults with her were very concerned as you would expect and the hall emptied
1289871 i wouldnt like to put a figure on the amount of money were spending because our requirements are changing almost daily
1289872 the big four venues do have an interest in the ticket sales that are going through our systems so we will be spending some of our own money on it but any costs that are incurred will be going to the fringe
1289873 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1289874 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1289875 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1289876 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1289877 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1289878 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1289879 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country

1289882 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation

1289890 this revised business case estimates potential net savings of 11 5 million over three years as the council starts to spend less on certain areas by standardising our purchasing processes and managing contracts more effectively
1289891 it also estimates that we would be able to provide our services with about 293 fewer posts over the same period although any such staff savings would only come through natural attrition
1289892 there are a lot of people who want a degree of service which state provision just cannot achieve and we have set out to do just that i get a tremendous buzz from providing a good service to people in their own homes
1289893 we provide care for not only older people but also adults with physical disabilities and i am determined that every single one of them will receive the same high standard of service which i would provide to a relative or to a friend

1289908 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

1289924 but what got me through it was believing with all my heart that i would succeed
1289925 i took one finance class in college but dropped it to go on a ski trip
1289926 i actually had to go to my bank and ask them to teach me how to read my statement
1289927 so i read books and magazines about money management and investing and i asked every financial whiz i knew to explain things to me

1289932 i live by the law of abundance meaning that even when there are challenges in life i look for the win win

1289947 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1289948 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1289949 absolutely because in june a month before he said and did i mention that theyre going to say hes black john mccain doesnt have a racist bone in his body and theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1289950 and you also suggest hes going to say the way hes going to get elected is to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible we went through this in south carolina john has an adopted daughter from bangladesh on the right they said john mccain had an illegitimate black daughter now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain interjecting he looks funny and sounds funny were not going to put up with this to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
1289951 so thats what he was saying just that hes younger
1289952 no no no he has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist hes never said anything that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
1289953 no what he was saying is theyre trying to scare you theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that they are engaged in character assassination even john mccains partner in a number of initiatives in the senate russ feingold said yesterday theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character and that is exactly what this ad is calculated to do
1289954 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president when you use the expressions that senator obama did three times this week youre making a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain ive been with him for 20 years private and public this man does not have a bigoted bone in his body his wife and he adopted a baby from bangladesh who they love its just wrong for senator obama to have done that it was right for the campaign to call him on it
1289955 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1289956 given the tenure of the mccain camps attacks on senator obama i can understand senator obama saying that senator obama wants to run as much as he can from a campaign thats focused only on race
1289957 john mccain has worked over time to keep race out of this campaign and to keep the focus on issues this is not the first time that the race card has been played by the obama campaign bill clinton even said that the race card was played on him in south carolina and now the mccain campaign is saying look you introduced the whole notion of race
1289958 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy thats how he would act as a president which is to move forward and to work with the people who disagree with him to find measures that he thinks makes sense
1289959 what senator obama said is what we want a president to say lets look at all of the options lets compare them
1289960 barack obama has always been in favor of offshore drilling but what he said is lets use first the 68 million acres that are already out there there is absolutely no reason why we cant begin where weve already got an opportunity
1289961 its typical you know every once in a while we see him playing basketball
1289962 i hope that senator obama will change his mind about offshore drilling but this issue of whether or not hes a leader this is a good test were out of session were out of business on energy when we should be in session doing the american peoples business pick up the phone and tell nancy pelosi who says offshore drilling is a hoax harry reid who says drilling is a red herring call the congress back in session hes the leader of the party youre a great guy you know all these people lets get the congress back in session
1289963 you know there really isnt a significant shift whats happened here is that a bipartisan group of senators has come together with a comprehensive paid for plan on energy and this plan includes some additional offshore oil drilling what senator obama has said is he welcomes the plan he welcomes working with the senators he welcomes their energy summit in september so this is a great opportunity for working together with a bipartisan group
1289964 senator obama is only in this position now because it became patently obvious over the last weeks particularly when nancy pelosi turned off the lights in the house of representatives and republican members refused to leave she had an insurrection in her own party because pelosi and reid at obamas behest were refusing to move forward on drilling so he is now trying to get credit for being all of the above energy planner
1289965 he still believes we should not drill offshore what hes prepared to do is break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive i think what you see in the response on this drilling is really the difference in how they might govern
1289966 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
1289967 because the misrepresentation has been made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump this is again a decoy its not a solution
1289968 you never say never to anything people have their parliamentary options available to them
1289969 ive enjoyed working with senator mccain as he serves in the united states senate and i look forward to continuing to do that
1289970 he says when hes president he can work with you the way that ronald reagan worked with tip oneill
1289971 well i look forward to working with barack obama but stand ready to work with any president of the united states
1289972 im worried that this approach is not worthy of the office of president that senator mccain and senator obama are running for for senator mccain to demean the race for the presidency in this way is i think not humorous i think its silly
1289973 i support anyone that senator obama is comfortable with for vice president i didnt want to see a discussion of candidates for vice president without showing the house of representatives chet edwards for years our colleagues have said to him why dont you run for president he is an extraordinarily talented person he is a champion for veterans in the congress under his leadership we have passed including just on friday the biggest increase in funding for veterans health benefits and other benefits in the history of our country hes a master of needs of our military and their families he understands the issues of nonproliferation he has been a champion in the appropriations committee and the congress hes from south texas he represents president bush in the congress
1289974 well i would certainly hope so but you know what senator dodd senator biden senator hillary clinton theres such a great array of people from whom senator obama can choose so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards and i hope he will be the nominee
1289975 they have not and im always honored to be mentioned im proud to be campaigning for this incredibly bright man who is going the change course in this country but i think that all the speculation is going to come to an end soon because at least were going to get choices before too long
1289976 i dont honestly know i talked to barack about it this weekend you know what he did he just smiled
1289977 im supporting senator mccaskill on the democrats side after her feisty performance today i think shed be great for senator obama
1289978 no i think the whole vp thing is a little bit overrated its important but maybe the media is giving it a little bit more importance than it deserves the key is whos at the top of the ticket
1289979 youre pro choice and mccain says because of that even though he likes you a lot it would be difficult to name you as vice president take us inside the room if senator mccain says you know this is the difficulty i have otherwise i want you what do you say to him
1289980 well john and i have been friends for 25 years and i know this issue is very important to john its obviously very important to probably the majority of the men and women in the republican party and i dont think john would ever make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate it is their decision exclusively and i would respect their decision one way or the other
1289981 john is not judgmental on the issue he feels very strongly about it will always feel strongly about it as the majority of the party but i have had that point of view before i got into politics i had it when i was in politics and i preserve that point of view now so inside the room i listen to my friend and be quite comfortable with any decision he made because he would make it for the right reason
1289982 ill have that private conversation with my friend john and then perhaps report back to you
1289983 the fact is he is black and he is injecting race its a way to make people more comfortable its the elephant in the room perhaps he misspoke a little bit but i dont think he accused john mccain of being a racist or running a racist campaign clearly he has sought to inject race in a healthy way and hes done it time and time again
1289984 if you can define him as the black guy in the race its to his detriment i think obama is fearful of this but the way that he put it in mccains mouth i think it was a huge mistake by barack obama because barack obama doesnt want to bring up race in that way he wants to be the unifier he doesnt want to remind them that hes the black guy in the race so he did play the race card mccain responded and i think responded fairly
1289985 theres a lot of danger in this for barack obama it cuts both ways but most of the negatives go to him its all about his response he has to have sort of a light touch on this if he comes off looking angry then that could be to the benefit of other candidates it sort of happened in tennessee with harold ford another telegenic african american candidate who found himself in the position of taking in these racial charges and responding in a slightly angry way the voters didnt like that and it turned out to be a big problem for him he lost
1289986 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1289987 i think that was an off the cuff remark i think he was but i dont think he meant to do it and i dont think it would be helpful for him to do it the american people dont like being called racist i think they consider race a tough and sacred issue which they want touched in an intelligent way they do not want it touched in the heat of a political campaign in my view whoever raises the race issue is going to hurt themselves
1289988 this week expect that well see some face to faces between obama and some of these prospective candidates joe biden and evan bayh apparently will have some face time at some point this week hell be out in indiana and so were trying to figure out where joe biden is going to be meeting him
1289989 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1289990 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1289991 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1289992 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1289993 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1289994 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1289995 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1289996 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1289997 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1289998 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1289999 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
