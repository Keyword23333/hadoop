4430015 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4430016 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4430017 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time

4430062 one of its primary purposes is to train employees how to aggressively promote homosexuality within the company they work for all the way to the corporate boardroom part of last years out amp equal summit in washington dc sponsored by mcdonalds was an organized march into congressional offices demanding same sex marriage laws be passed

4430066 the bush administration will soon propose regulations to protect healthcare professionals from being forced to participate in immoral practices astonishingly abortion proponents vehemently oppose this they are against the right of doctors to choose not to do abortions
4430067 federal laws protect the right of healthcare providers not to participate in abortion or other controversial practices but the laws are ignored recently two medical associations passed guidelines that could require doctors to commit or refer for abortions
4430068 support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law
4430069 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
4430070 planned parenthood and some media are trying to frame the new regulations as an attack on contraception
4430071 on the contrary the proposed regulations focus on the right of health professionals to follow their conscience and to do no harm it allows medical providers in their professional judgment and substantiated by medical textbooks to determine that abortion is an action that terminates a human life before or after implantation
4430072 abortion advocates are causing a ruckus about a rule that simply requires health agencies to follow the law and not to discriminate against people with moral beliefs against taking an innocent life
4430073 secretary leavitt provided an excellent explanation on his blog its been flooded with negative comments from abortion advocates demanding that health providers do whatever a woman demands
4430074 as patients we depend with our lives on health providers to be moral but if ethical professionals with strong consciences are forced out of the profession patients will suffer the most

4430094 microsoft is committed to its partners and employees in massachusetts and looks forward to expanding its strong r amp d presence in cambridge
4430095 after blackstone took over their intent seemed to be to clear the building out

4430106 we decided to stay together as a group because we realised that we worked well together there was no female hip hop crew and that it would be nice to form a female hip hop crew we all had been in hip hop groups before with guys but never an all female group
4430107 the best thing is the pride instilled in our families they dont always understand and support us but we are all hardkopraag and so they are forced to support us
4430108 also you know when your mother sees you on tv and when she phones you you can just hear the pride in her voice
4430109 the worst thing about performing is forgetting lyrics i do that often because sometimes you can enjoy the show so much that you blank out also tripping over the cords it happens to me a lot i can be a bit clumsy the other thing is the audience not feeling you i mean weve travelled far to perform for five people to perform for ten people and thats not even exaggerating
4430110 we rap about aids because we all from aids projects but we talk about whatever we feel is necessary to address from a perspective that wont be addressed things people think about but never talk about a lot from personal experiences come into play when we write our songs because we all come from different backgrounds and experiences
4430111 we focus on a range of issues especially with our new album were finishing off our music is conscious music and that can be very heavy so were trying to create music for inspiration hope and inspiration seems unreachable especially when you from the cape flats so our message must be positive and inspire people
4430112 i started rapping because i was not working i always loved rapping and always wanted to be a part of that its like a gang you want to be part of it i didnt finish high school and i had nothing to do so boredom and the need to do something inspired me my biggest inspiration is the energy you find in hip hop i come from a very religious background and with hip hop i find a place to express myself
4430113 being a female hip hop group is seen as a novelty and is the general response from the media and the industry but we experience the same challenges as women in general like proving yourself and working ten times harder
4430114 a lot of women if they are in the industry deal with the organising of hip hop not the rapping maybe its too much to be a rapper but its not many women resort to spokenword maybe because they think its better suited for women maybe they think rap is too hardcore for example girls prefer crumping rather than break dancing a lot of women play instruments but are not participating there are no enough female djs
4430115 so what sets us apart is that we are a live band and mix different genres
4430116 earned a place in history in south africa but this remains significant because eight years later there is still no female hip hop group there were others before us but they broke up

4430123 it is possible that some retail traders that are not as active could potentially go to the sidelines but historically our traders have traded in good times and in bad times
4430124 in periods that have seen high volatility we delivered some very good numbers from a revenue perspective
4430125 we are very comfortable with just having an online footprint
4430126 our members are already struggling to keep up with risingfood and energy costs this pay offer is an insult
4430127 we wont leave until dyantyi comes and gives us keys for the newly built houses in langa delft and nyanga
4430128 were very excited its the first time in our lives that well have a house
4430129 we did our first trades at 8 a m and weve had ordersand executions all morning
4430130 members will take a while to get comfortable with it all and certainly we expect volumes to be small more likeproduction testing until we complete the first clearing andsettlement cycles
4430131 this is a supporting factor for the automotive sector aswell as for demand driven industries as consumers feel therelief through lower fuel prices
4430132 no way home the decline of the worlds great animal migrations
4430133 protecting the abundance of migrants is the key to protecting the ecological importance of migration
4430134 ultimately however it is only through dialogue with vested interests that recommendations to reduce threats can be implemented protecting corridors will necessitate addressing difficult issues but baseline data provide opportunities to engage in these discussions before situations become dire
4430135 if we are successful it will be because governments and individuals have learned to act proactively and cooperatively to address environmental problems and because we have created an international network of protected areas that is capable of sustaining much of the planets natural diversity
4430136 the further birds migrate north for the summer the faster they put on weight
4430137 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4430138 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4430139 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4430140 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4430141 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4430142 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
4430143 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

4430170 we have been under siege for the last two years
4430171 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4430172 the cease fire that was negotiated through egypt was very specific that the hamas movement and the other terrorist groups cant use it as a period to import more weapons more explosives more rockets into the gaza strip
4430173 the right to act if need be to protect ourselves we dont want this current quiet just to be the quiet before the storm
4430174 the current cease fire is something we israel wants to continue
4430175 its good for the people in israels south who suffered under the barrage of the rockets its good for the palestinians in gaza everyone would want this cease fire to continue except for these extremist elements who run the gaza strip who want to continue their violent jihad its a problem for israel and for the palestinians
4430176 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
4430177 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
4430178 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl

4430183 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4430184 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4430185 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4430186 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4430187 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4430188 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4430189 have requested assistance in their investigation and we have immediately started our own probe
4430190 its just balls to the walls 6 oclock to 10 oclock
4430191 its our way of giving back to them and showing support for them being in the downtown area
4430192 a lot of people dont even realize what businesses are downtown
4430193 we have to find a way to keep people down here
4430194 by creating an organized bike ride we could support our favorite cause and give back to our community in a meaningful way
4430195 that explains why weve focused so much of this event around our favorite things in boulder county
4430196 were not in this for fame or money hardly we started venus de miles with the hope that this ride can make a difference in the lives of many
4430197 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back

4430224 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4430225 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4430226 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4430227 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4430228 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4430229 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4430230 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4430231 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4430236 theres something about the community that draws you in as an artist
4430237 you sense that this is a place that makes you happy
4430238 its just way cool to live in a neighborhood when you have a friend whos an artist four doors down
4430239 its just sort of attracted people who put health and wholeness ahead of other important things in life
4430240 i think its a common sense way to save gas
4430241 i dont see any reason why we have to drive a 4 000 pound car
4430242 when i went in that was the choice i was trying to make what team can i make the roster
4430243 denver was right there at the end in 2003 i like coach mike shanahan and hes a great coach but it just happens the way it does for certain reasons
4430244 for me every year youre in the league its a different development year
4430245 you learn different things and you can kind of figure out some things experience is the greatest tool for improvement in this league
4430246 im not going to get into the specifics of it but youre always looking at yourself from a realistic standpoint and youre going to say hey what do i need to do to improve what are my weaknesses thats what you spend all offseason on
4430247 thats the thing florida has five guys with acls already
4430248 it just comes with the territory of playing football its a physical sport its a fast sport it separates the men from the boys youre going to get hurt sometimes you dont know how things happen or why
4430249 it kind of breaks your heart you feel bad for the kids
4430250 it just makes you realize you have to be grateful for the opportunity to play and take advantage of those opportunities my heart goes out to those guys
4430251 jon major is lucky he has a redshirt year but iltis was probably going to play this year and drew hudgins has had a string of bad luck
4430252 you cant really think about injuries usually when youre thinking about it is when you go get hurt so you just have to go out and play
4430253 there are a lot worse things that could have happened and as far as the timing this is probably the best it could be
4430254 if i was a junior id just be frustrated but this is an opportunity to develop more mentally and physically
4430255 this started in the back parking lot and as the years have gone by theres been more and more people interested in doing this kind of work
4430256 it would cost us money to do these things and as a nonprofit its always great when volunteer workers do it rather than using the money that would otherwise go to the youth we work with
4430257 is perhaps the least surprising headline in the history of
4430258 a classic case of one step forward two steps back or in this instance light on new production heavy on new taxes
4430259 gang of 10 senators led by democrat kent conrad of north dakota and republican saxby chambliss of georgia that is aimed at breaking a partisan stalemate on energy policy
4430260 new taxes on u s based energy companies would drastically cut capital that otherwise could be invested in domestic oil and natural gas production and expanded refining capacity
4430261 the net result could be to stifle high risk capital intensive projects in the u s leaving americans more dependent on foreign sources of energy while jeopardizing u s jobs and economic growth
4430262 when they have a bill im glad to talk about it
4430263 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4430264 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4430265 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4430266 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4430267 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4430268 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4430269 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

4430275 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4430276 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4430277 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4430278 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4430279 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4430280 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4430281 obviously you get to spend some valuable time i mean were up here for a whole week so were here from 6 til 6 at night its valuable time we get to spend with the kids and thats nice you dont get to do that when youre on the road a lot
4430282 its a bonding time because sometimes hes always out buying or doing other shows and i dont really get to see a lot of him so its a good time

4430287 michael is back in training but i think to be honest manchester united will come a bit early
4430288 its no good trying to kid people he just need a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do and were not going into that into him now so i think its very very doubtful
4430289 a little slow in my reads and my footwork but thatll all come with a little more practice
4430290 you never feel 100 percent coming back from a groin injury a hamstring injury or things like that i have to work through the pain and hopefully get out there and try to show up on saturday

4430299 i represent a third choice if you want a different voice one for sanity and sustainability
4430300 i think coloradans really understand the difference between crude oil and snake oil and in this case theyre being sold snake oil
4430301 we can take the bush cheney schaffer road which weve been on for the last eight years high unemployment an energy policy thats got us 4 bucks a gallon gas or we could start down another road
4430302 and that road would involve a comprehensive energy policy looking after the middle class who are increasingly getting squeezed and even choked
4430303 where we work together look weve got a lot at stake but together we can get this right
4430304 ive been opposed though to the bush cheney schaffer approach which is drill drill drill as the answer for our energy future
4430305 mark you cant keep on sitting here in front of us and prevaricating your way toward election day
4430306 for inviting the minor party folks to sit in with the big guns over there
4430307 im not too sure we got too many words in edgewise
4430308 we cant talk about energy without talking about the environment
4430309 theyre talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic
4430310 to talk about getting more oil so we can burn more oil is crazy its like you know were addicted to it and the addictions going to kill us
4430311 neither i nor anybody whos serious about energy independence is going to join you in your new bill
4430312 flamenco is so full of power and its passionate it feels like its the rock of classical guitar
4430313 what were doing were mixing them so it feels like a cohesive whole
4430314 i think weve spent a lot of time on this and ultimately we have a lot of other matters we need to address
4430315 people come in and they vote for the president and some state offices
4430316 some of the local items dont even get voted on its a firestone issue and i think we need to keep the focus on firestone in this election
4430317 and i like the convenience of having it all at once
4430318 were into getting the information and getting it out there
4430319 i guess weve got a pretty short time frame to do it but i guess thats what were going to do
4430320 i think this is a very exciting time for firestone
4430321 whatever happens a group organized themselves got in front of our citizens and put it to us thats exciting whatever happens its government in action
4430322 my personal belief is that this is the right thing for the community
4430323 it may not happen tomorrow but as our children grow up theres an opportunity there to help the town of firestone
4430324 it fits very well with the theme of the mystical experience of the divine
4430325 its not institutionally religious but more of a way of life
4430326 more about the experience than any one thought or idea
4430327 ive always been interested in the spiritual sacred aspect of dance
4430328 theres something about being seen and seeing other people saying sacred words and acknowledging that
4430329 it just resonates throughout your whole body to not only say the words and hear them but to move to them you dont keep that within yourself you express it out to others

4430343 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4430344 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4430345 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4430346 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4430347 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4430348 yes theyre living separate lives at the moment because of his shenanigans
4430349 its disappointing that getty and miller are flaunting this so publicly there are four children involved their oldest cassius is mature enough to understand somethings not right
4430350 cleveland clinic has entered an era characterized by growth innovation and patient centered care
4430351 the opening of the miller family pavilion and glickman tower is a transformational event for our health system together these structures will revolutionize the delivery of medical care for patients and clinicians alike placing the needs of patients and their families at the center and providing the most state of the art healthcare experience possible

4430361 at times lyrical at times somber sobel delivers the bare facts about the planets often noting the dissonance between astrologys romance and astronomys reality
4430362 for the most part gores stripped down narrative emphasizes facts over emotion common sense over portentous predictions
4430363 people have often described me as a blogger i generally shy away from the term because to me bloggers are boring self obsessed narcissists who use their website mainly as a means to discuss the inconsequential minutiae of their day to day lives
4430364 it should feel genuinely good to earn income from your blog you should be driven by a healthy ambition to succeed if your blog provides genuine value you fully deserve to earn income from it
4430365 yes blogging is entertainment it is performance each blog post a show sometimes an opera sometimes a 30 second commercial like a show it may start with a bang lead you along from song to song have a great climatic moment then leave the audience wanting more
4430366 in at least one way we are atypical bloggers thats because we just keep on posting the typical blogger like most people who go on diets and budgets quits after a few months weeks or in many cases days
4430367 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4430368 it is estimated that there will be a global warming of 1 to 6 degrees by the end of the century and we examined how this could manifest at smaller spatial scales and within shorter time periods
4430369 we identified areas likely to be most responsive to changes in greenhouse gas emissions this study provides information at the state scale as opposed to a global or regional average which could be useful for climate change policy
4430370 one interesting and surprising result is that we see the same hotspot patterns even at lower greenhouse gas concentrations
4430371 this suggests that we may be able to see these hotspots emerging already
4430372 on campus housing provides easy access to the full benefits of campus life
4430373 with its community building activities and popular dining options residential life paves the way for a positive transition to college
4430374 students who have been assigned to temporary housing typically applied late in the process and were advised they might be housed in converted spaces
4430375 we are pleased that we are the housing of choice for so many students and we do our absolute best to accommodate every student who wants to live in university residences
4430376 the ongoing popularity of on campus housing is what prompts and allows us to continuously improve and now add to our housing options
4430377 sally has done an outstanding job over the past six years and her leadership is much appreciated
4430378 she leaves behind a dynamic highly productive department well positioned to serve purdue agricultures traditional learning discovery and engagement missions
4430379 i am excited to work with the exceptional people that make up this department
4430380 it is an honor to serve in this capacity and i look forward to helping members of our department leverage their skills and capabilities to better serve the university and the state of indiana
4430381 ken is a respected member of our faculty and demonstrated his leadership abilities as associate head
4430382 he will do a great job of guiding the department during this transition
4430383 intelimmunes process has strong applications for federal state and local law enforcement as well for the medical industry
4430384 this also is another example of how researchers at discovery parks bindley bioscience center and purdues new center for analytical instrumentation development can make a difference in working with life sciences companies to deliver ideas to the marketplace
4430385 this collaboration is an excellent opportunity as we grow our company and its a great opportunity for discovery park and purdue as they work to deliver products and processes that can make a real difference in society
4430386 purdue also has a strong commitment to engage with indiana companies to help create jobs and grow the states economy
4430387 law enforcement can use breathalyzers to determine whether a person is above the legal limit for alcohol use and saliva is used to detect the presence of marijuana or thc in a persons system but that test isnt reliable
4430388 we look to deliver a proven process that will vastly improve on the present day test for marijuana
4430389 its been an amazing recovery for indianas corn crop considering the challenging weather
4430390 this report shows an amazing recovery for the corn crop and we have pulled back from a crisis in food supply and crop availability
4430391 the united states is a major supplier to world markets of food
4430392 when you combine the tight food supplies with the flooding in june we were just right on the edge of not having enough supply and availability
4430393 but compared to what weve been thinking the last three four five months this is a blessing
4430394 the yield numbers for soybeans reflect that the crop is just not very far along and that theres still potential to be had on beans
4430395 typically the crop looks best in june and this year it looked the worst in june
4430396 but with the good weather weve had the last few weeks and a few rain showers it has gotten much better weve even seen a 30 percent drop in prices from the highest point as the weather has gotten better this years 2008 corn crop is priced at 5 40 per bushel
4430397 its still high for the u s average at 5 40 but again we had anticipated higher prices with the flooding we saw a couple of months ago
4430398 thats the bad news prices are lower some producers will wonder why they didnt go ahead and price more of their crop back in june but most producers know that high prices are not good for the livestock producers the consumers and the world trying to feed itself and so this makes them feel good
4430399 for every bushel or pound of agricultural production theres a buyer for that product and because of that we are going to continue to see tight balance sheets in this new paradigm
4430400 we see the response to the high prices in producers trying to maximize production on every acre they have in operation
4430401 stuff like that winning championships happens when you get the breaks
4430402 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4430403 now people are realizing that the u k has the same problems as if not more so than the u s
4430404 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4430405 the president wishes to reassure members of the public that he has absolutely no intention whatsoever of seeking to remain in office beyond the maximum tenure of 10 years as proscribed by the constitution should he be so re elected his excellency is a strong believer in the principle of term limits and therefore would wish to discourage any suggestions that his own tenure be extended

4430410 during the quarter advance nanotech continued the shift of its business model from managing the development of a portfolio of early stage nanotechnologies to focusing only on the development of the owlstone chemical detection system we achieved our quarter and first half revenue growth targets and have begun to benefit from cost cutting measures that we implemented in addition contracts we have secured during the second quarter and contracts we expect to be awarded in the third quarter should provide for our continued growth
4430411 we anticipate consummating the exchange agreement between advance nanotech and owlstone shortly integration of the two companies will enable the companys management team to focus entirely on building a solid revenue stream on existing products develop more commercial applications using our ground breaking technology and streamline operations and control costs more effectively
4430412 now behold you will be and will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place because you have not believed what i told you but my words are of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed and proper time
4430413 but i say to you that for every idle word men may speak they will give account of it in the day of judgment
4430414 a mans moral self shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth and with the consequence of his words he must be satisfied whether good or evil
4430415 we are looking at maintaining a 22 percent growth in sales while for the bottom line we are looking at similar growth
4430416 based on the six months figures we are confident we can achieve that
4430417 the danger we see ahead is inflation increased costs of manufacturing and production and we are not sure we can pass all our costs to the customer therefore our margins will temporarily go down
4430418 but over a period of time as things stabilise we should be able to recover
4430419 the economy generally is still growing the regional economy is still strong as long as the government keeps looking at the infrastructure needs of the country demand for cement is going to keep on growing
4430420 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4430421 given macroeconomic uncertainty and continued traffic volatility we do not think stocks will be rewarded for overly bullish outlooks there is risk to models where second half recoveries are assumed and or guided
4430422 for these retailers we expect inventory positions to decline in the mid single digits to the high single digits at the fiscal second quarter and for improved sales composition and price integrity through second half of the year
4430423 we acknowledge that foreign economies are in flux however we think the white space in the mid tier branded category remains significant particularly in europe where the luxury and value categories are largely established but few companies compete on a branded basis in between

4430464 the first product to be released to market using this platform will be the iq 577 tm which will deliver 577 nm yellow light from a solid state laser in either conventional continuous wave cw or micropulse mode the iq 577 provides a wavelength and technology that complements our product portfolio and is not commercially available from any of our competitors 577 nm is of interest because it is at the peak of the oxyhemoglobin absorption curve and was a popular wavelength when argon dye laser systems were widely distributed however due to complexity and poor reliability those products are now obsolete we believe that a reliable solid state 577 nm laser system has the opportunity to fill this void

4430576 tijdens onze roadshow langs beleggers en analisten begin dit jaar verwachtte ik lastige vragen en onwillige beleggers ik heb het echter nog nooit zo makkelijk gehad jarenlang kregen wij kritiek vanwege onze lage hefboom
4430577 wereldhave behoort met een leverage van 30 tot de europese top 5 van meest solide gefinancierde vastgoedfondsen lange tijd was dat helemaal niet sexy
4430578 nu het lastig is om te herfinancieren niet alleen voor vastgoedbeleggers is opereren met weinig vreemd vermogen de trendanalisten letten vooral op hoeveel bedrijven op korte termijn moeten herfinancieren voor ons is dat in 2008 ongeveer 35 miljoen en in 2009 50 miljoen op een portefeuille van 2 7 miljard euro is dit dus beperkt
4430579 de jaren 80 begonnen slecht vastgoed daalde in waarde begin jaren 90 gebeurde hetzelfde helaas had wereldhave toen niet een voldoende sterke balans om hiervan te profiteren toen ik in 1994 bestuursvoorzitter werd heb ik dat veranderd als vastgoed goedkoop is dan wil ik kunnen kopen
4430580 begin van dit millennium verwachtte ik weer dalende prijzen echter door de stortvloed aan goedkoop geld werd vastgoed juist duurder en gingen de aanvangsrendementen omlaag iedereen weet hoe dit eindigde de banken moeten hun huishoudboekje op orde brengen en de tijd van goedkoop krediet is voorbij
4430581 de omzet daalt niet het bezoek wel dat komt misschien ook door de hoge brandstofprijs klanten komen minder vaak maar kopen meer waar wij voor moeten zorgen is een goede branchering in onze centra dat betekent ook winkels in het lagere segment een plek geven die zullen misschien minder huur betalen dan de topwinkels maar in slechtere tijden wel genoeg klanten trekken
4430582 californi het aangename klimaat de energiesector en de handel met azi zorgen ervoor dat daar op termijn voldoende groei zal zijn wij hebben daarom vorig jaar een groot kantoorpand in san diego gekocht steden hebben onze voorkeur vanwege de trek van de bevolking naar de stad traditioneel maar nu ook als gevolg van de hoge brandstofprijzen
4430583 texas doet het als staat heel goed natuurlijk vanwege de olie maar ook dankzij de beschikbaarheid van goedkope arbeidskrachten uit mexico en de cara ben in finland hebben we veel succes met het winkelcentrum dat we daar in 2002 hebben gekocht ook daar is slechts een aantal belangrijke steden waar veel jongeren naartoe trekken hoofdstad helsinki waar het centrum staat is de belangrijkste
4430584 in principe is er nergens tekort aan vastgoed ook niet in een hoogconjunctuur hooguit een tekort aan nieuw vastgoed dat is ook de reden dat wij alleen nieuw vastgoed kopen consumenten willen steeds het beste product ook als het om vastgoed gaat dat zie je nu bijvoorbeeld met de energierekening
4430585 als de energiekosten omlaag kunnen willen huurders graag verhuizen naar een nieuw duurzamer pand ook als het economisch minder gaat om de huren hoeven ze het in nederland in ieder geval niet te doen die zijn er laag genoeg voor
4430586 nee de verkopers hebben nog de verwachting dat zij de prijs kunnen krijgen die ze willen de kopers zijn het daarmee niet eens dus er wordt weinig verkocht dat zal straks wel veranderen maar dan zijn het door de bank gedwongen verkopen bij vastgoedfondsen die niet zon sterke balans hebben
4430587 wat dat betreft maken wij het onszelf moeilijk door onze eis van alleen nieuw vastgoed blijven er weinig kandidaten over overnemen om groter te worden bij gebrek aan autonome groei dat doen we niet het moet strategisch wel passen
4430588 bij ons niets ik zal niet meer gaan verdienen ik doe precies hetzelfde werk voor onze medewerkers is een aex notering echt een beloning zij hebben heel hard gewerkt vooral aan investor relations de 100 free float heeft ook geholpen bij onze promotie naar de hoofdindex voor de aandeelhouders betekent dit nog meer liquiditeit
4430589 we hebben turkije een aantal jaar kritisch gevolgd het past in onze strategie het is een snel groeiende economie een jonge bevolking en veel mogelijkheden onze collega corio begon met een rendement van 10 maar de rendementen komen nu wat naar beneden zeg naar gemiddeld 7 5
4430590 dit vinden wij niet hoog voor het risico dat wij moeten nemen de turkse markt is nog behoorlijk illiquide en er is instabiliteit op politiek en economisch gebied wat dan wel interessant is in de zeven landen waar we actief zijn zien we voorlopig genoeg mogelijkheden zeker ook nu met de hoge brandstofprijzen is een sterke multifunctionele stad heel erg belangrijk wij blijven ons richten op groeiende stadscentra waar we meer kunnen ontwikkelen en waar nieuw hoogwaardig vastgoed gevraagd wordt

4430592 these survey results are a clarion call for the health financing mechanism used elsewhere nonprofit national health insurance

4430594 all that adds up to an american public that is quite ready for health care reform

4430597 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4430598 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4430599 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation

4430646 if only there was some way to capture text in a listbox
4430647 its such a good pub and its such a cool pub and the people who run it are really nice
4430648 when i first went down there we werent that famous as the
4430649 deutet zumindest an dass es schon lange nur noch gold ist was gl nzt dass zumindest das fernsehen diesen glanz nicht mehr zu halten vermag den es fr her wohl mal ausstrahlte
4430650 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4430651 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4430652 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
4430653 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4430654 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4430655 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4430656 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4430657 ive said all along this has got to be resolved
4430658 this has been very very difficult for the city and for the state and its obvious why we need a resolution
4430659 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4430660 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4430661 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4430662 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4430663 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4430664 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4430665 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4430666 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4430667 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4430668 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4430669 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4430670 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4430671 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4430672 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4430673 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4430674 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4430675 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4430676 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4430677 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4430678 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream
4430679 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4430680 two months before the olympics i made a board with pictures of things that inspire me and my mom hung one of his gold medals on the board
4430681 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4430682 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4430683 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream
4430684 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4430685 two months before the olympics i made a board with pictures of things that inspire me and my mom hung one of his gold medals on the board
4430686 in the hardest moment before beam i told her theres nothing to be afraid of
4430687 she hit all her tumbling passes on floor shes a tiger inside i truly believed she was not second i strongly believed her time was coming
4430688 the vehicle was not being used for transporting patients and was at the end of its working life it was in the workshop as part of a decommissioning process
4430689 there is now going to be an investigation as to why it was being used to carry timber misuse of an ambulance is a very serious matter
4430690 we obviously dont condone the use of an ambulance to transport timber but someone abusing an ambulance vehicle is obviously out of our control
4430691 je ne vends pas moins de disques je vends diff remment

4430693 the experience of giancarlo is invaluable and adrian has lots of talent i think he is improving race by race becoming more consistent
4430694 i think they will be very satisfied driving the 2009 car which i am sure will be a significant improvement and a big surprise
4430695 i am very happy with what vijay said about his drivers
4430696 i think that adrian and i show strength and great team spirit as i said before i am very happy with force india i have a contract for 2009 and never saw myself out of it
4430697 i am very satisfied with the system it works well
4430698 two tenths on a single lap and maybe three during the race
4430699 but we need six or seven tenths to close the gap with the cars in front so it is not going to be so easy

4430710 o termo labirintite utilizado popularmente para designar apenas uma tontura mas quando o diagn stico realmente de irrita o prim ria do labirinto a patologia apresenta outros sintomas
4430711 o estresse pode ocasionar sensa o de inseguran a e tontura o que em um primeiro momento pode ser confundido com labirintite
4430712 a recupera o do paciente de uma crise de labirintite aguda pode levar de uma a seis semanas por m n o incomum que sintomas residuais desequil brio e tontura permane am por muitos meses ou at anos
4430713 na maioria dos casos os neurologistas optam por medicamentos inibidores do labirinto
4430714 in high school we studied super 8 films that our coach shot at an olympics with the video feeds now coming online along with link based editing that creates annotated playlists and a mturk like task allocation to distribute the work of annotation that analysis could become a crowdsourced activity
4430715 interpreting after the largest ice raid in us history a personal account
4430716 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4430717 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4430718 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar any more
4430719 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4430720 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4430721 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4430722 i think there are some very strong growth signals in these results stronger than i can ever remember seeing in vestas
4430723 in particular i want to highlight the order book of 7 2 billion i might have bid 5 5 billion if i had been optimistic
4430724 the continuing improvement in profitability is attributable to the higher prices which vestas initiated in 2005 and the ongoing enhancement of operational efficiency
4430725 the cycle has turned inflation will restrict the feds ability to cut rates plus we have weaker growth in europe so the euro has been suffering
4430726 the dollar is coming out top at the moment so people have been liquidating commodities
4430727 gold really needs to hold here otherwise it will slide back towards 750 which is the last vestige of the uptrend
4430728 if it loses that the whole thing could just unravel
4430729 the more industrial precious metals like silver and platinum are also being hampered by concerns about global growth demand for platinum in auto catalysts and for silver in its industrial off takes
4430730 the key to him giving us more innings is pitching more aggressively
4430731 i feel confident he will pitch more aggressively because he will use his fastball more last year we saw a guy who had gotten away from his fastball
4430732 im going now to talk to georgian president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4430733 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4430734 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4430735 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4430736 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalize their presence in georgia
4430737 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement

4430744 theres still some red tape to go through so im still a little bit scared
4430745 im getting a lot of pressure from my constituents to do something about those 30 guys standing on the street all the time
4430746 i got an e mail from a lady that lives on the west end of alabama drive talking about how scared she was how afraid she was to go out at night or to go out during the daytime because of the men just hanging out people shouldnt have to live like that
4430747 were going to monitor events and were frankly concerned that the day laborers civil rights will be violated
4430748 obviously senator obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4430749 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4430750 basically you are looking at an even race in virginia
4430751 but we think mccain is a republican who matches up very well in virginia
4430752 they are now seeing the same things we are seeing which is it is really close in virginia
4430753 we are making a strong effort there and we are making that strong effort because we absolutely believe that virginia is in play
4430754 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4430755 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4430756 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4430757 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4430758 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4430759 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4430760 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4430761 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4430762 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4430763 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4430764 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4430765 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4430766 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4430767 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4430768 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4430769 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4430770 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4430771 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4430772 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4430773 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
4430774 youve got to break a world record to win i gave it my all i had nothing left ryan handed me a great race i have no regrets
4430775 i dont know if im going to look at it that way it really doesnt take anything away from my career a race is a race you can get beat no one owns anything
4430776 i definitely feel like the schedules tougher than i thought it was going to be doing it twice
4430777 i handled it at trials but the olympic games is very challenging
4430778 im going to be in the sport a while and i want to have some fun
4430779 and this schedule you look at it you dont go into it as excited as when you are swimming just two or three i think i will re evaluate and focus in on two or three instead of five events
4430780 the organization and everything else is just unreal the accommodation the food is lovely
4430781 the recent several days have had very good conditions indeed
4430782 they sit around in small groups some in yellow shirts some in red shirts
4430783 they do not understand the rules of the game they cheer its a little bit funny

4430787 id estimate that i see 3g icon on the phone less than 1 3 of the time in so called 3g areas that i frequent in bay area and austin texas
4430788 there was a very nice beard tugging moment between me and sean if they ever go back and make a more extended version you can ask sean about it he may pretend not to remember
4430789 some 10 15 soldiers sprayed our car with weapons for at least 4 or 5 minutes i could not move the vehicle since the engine broke down we shouted at the soldiers that we were journalists we also took our t shirts off and waved them out of windows some 4 or 5 minutes later soldiers approached us
4430790 weve been investigating it and just discussed that we need to look more into it because its a little more elevated than what we normally see but we havent determined a commonality in any of our cases yet
4430791 were still doing our investigation but certainly nothing has jumped out at us
4430792 people who have persistent diarrhea with no known cause for 48 hours really should seek medical care
4430793 usually cases are reported quite quickly usually within four or five days
4430794 so what was born was a new understanding of the solar system they didnt keep saying lets keep adding up the planet numbers i look at the discovery of pluto just like the discovery of ceres
4430795 its a round object its got a rocky core and an icy mantle and is covered in clay
4430796 weve been to these places now we know so much about them were in a desperate need of a new lexicon to accommodate this new knowledge
4430797 if you go to europe and talk about pluto they look at you like yeah its that little thing out there
4430798 its not a battle over which list you want to have or what numbers you want to have but whats the basis for looking at things from different perspectives
4430799 maybe things are still in a high level of flux
4430800 having made its bed i think that it would feel embarrassed to say we messed up we take it all back were going to go in a different direction
4430801 i came to a point where i was willing to die
4430802 i just took my shoes off and my shirt off and jumped in
4430803 i just happened to come up and there was mr johnson
4430804 i saw him diving in my next breath i looked up and saw him touching my kayak i said i cant die and ruin his day i was worried about him then dakota showed up i think theyre two heroes i couldnt believe how fast everything was happening
4430805 they were soaking wet and they were out of breath because theyre both out of shape as young as they are
4430806 they did a selfless act and they did it without hesitation you cant tell them no no no and not reward them for the positive things
4430807 it feels really good doing something good to help someone
4430808 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4430809 you see it was the only workers i could get
4430810 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr
4430811 and has released a total of seven studio and four live albums under this label
4430812 which marked rushs first set of all new material since 2002s
4430813 were recently made available for the rock band video game
4430814 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4430815 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4430816 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4430817 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4430818 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4430819 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4430820 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4430821 eurovision would be an excellent way to make this theme known we must seriously think of this
4430822 i just think i wanna entertain and present myself in a manner where people wanna you know like what is she doing next what is she wearing how did she look where did she get that dress i do want to be a trendsetter
4430823 you know im always taking chances making bold movies and wearing stupid lolita glasses throughout a whole interview which i probably shouldnt be but shes kind of like my style icon

4430837 es un recuerdo para siempre algo hermoso para m y estoy s per contenta de haberlo hecho
4430838 i deserve the medal because i have trained for 14 years
4430839 because i shot second i was influenced by the first shooter my shooting time was slow and i couldnt concentrate anymore
4430840 we were under severe pressure by the taliban militants for the past several days
4430841 by putting up interceptors poland is placing itself at risk in terms of priority such targets are the first to be destroyed
4430842 im really glad to have got to this point and now that i have got here i really want to go out there and run as well as i can
4430843 my leg has been fine and has handled the biggest amount of running i have done on it so far in macau and things are good
4430844 i know it is going to hurt more than any other marathon because i am going in under prepared but i have a lot more fight and determination in me because of what i have been through to get to this point
4430845 if you arent on the start line you have no chance of winning a medal and for me it has been about being able to get to the start line healthy and able to give it a shot

4430884 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4430885 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4430886 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4430887 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4430888 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4430889 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4430890 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer
4430891 we are hopeful of a good run on sunday but obviously it is another very good race

4430906 obama is seeking to bring in double or triple the 84 1 million in federal funds that mccain will have to spend in the final two months before the nov 4 election in june obama declined to accept public financing which caps his spending at the federal allotment
4430907 not all republicans are opening their wallets to a mccain presidential run mallory factor a banker who co hosts a weekly meeting of conservatives in new york and raised more than 1 million for bush and his party four years ago told bloomberg
4430908 some republicans who support certain principles are shunning mccain factor said citing the arizona senators initial opposition to bushs tax cuts and his authorship of a campaign finance law opposed by many in his party

4430963 on my route to work through sydney every morning i drive under a huge electronic sign that straddles the northbound lanes of the pacific highway it is there to flash urgent messages to drivers warning them that there is an accident ahead or that some road has been closed and they should take an alternative route most days however there are no accidents and all the roads are open but rather than leave the sign blank on these mornings the officials at the rta always manage to invent some new warning or instruction to display to passing motorists this giant sign is a metaphor for much of what is wrong with government in australia it costs money to keep it running it often sends out stupid messages it is very intrusive it can easily lead to counterproductive results i sometimes wonder how many cyclists have been knocked off their bikes by motorists craning their necks to read a sign telling them to look out for cyclists and most of the time what it does is completely unnecessary but as with the sign so too with the government nobody can bring themselves to turn it off even when there is nothing useful for it to do

4431130 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4431131 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4431138 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4431139 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4431140 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered

4431148 i am really pleased to be able to support the summer fun run and crosby 10 it is a great event that raises money for fantastic local charities
4431149 i hope everyone will come along to crosby village on june 14 next year to have some fun while getting some exercise and raising money for such good causes
4431150 it would be amazing to make the final and one day i hope to have the success that sebastian coe steve ovett and steve cram had that would be a dream come true
4431151 kat staat te boek als serieuze journalist hoewel ik de afgelopen dagen heb ondervonden dat kat zich vakr in buitengewoon straffe en krenkende bewoordingen uitlaat bestond bij mij en vele anderen de indruk dat hij een degelijke journalist is verschillende bekenden van mij zeiden tegen mij dat als kat het geschreven heeft er toch wel iets van waar moet zijn dat is een niet onbelangrijk aspect van deze zaak
4431152 wat gek deze op zichzelf serieus te nemen journalist zegt nu opeens allemaal absurde en idiote dingen

4431156 a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a 19 century way of doing politics
4431157 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
4431158 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
4431159 i think its very clear that islamic ambitions are to restore the old caliphate
4431160 if youre a poor empty aimless soul lost to god and country who feels spiritually elevated in obamas presence its very easy to lose your head in your exalted feelings and enter the collective fairy land of obamamania as many entered such a place who blindly followed the jewish messiah sabbatai zvi or the ecstatic ignorant boy god guru maharaj ji
4431161 its always been the case that states have had the right to make their own decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage
4431162 no supreme or federal court ever said they states had to recognize each others marriages well before doma the defense of marriage act the principle was settled that states make their own choices
4431163 whether or not doma is repealed has no affect on forcing states to recognize same sex unions contracted in other states
4431164 the full faith and credit clause is interpreted by the supreme court not by congress frankly the section of the defense of marriage that purports to say what the full faith and credit means has no constitutional validity whatsoever because the supreme court has never allowed congress to make those decisions
4431165 full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof
4431166 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act
4431167 we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
4431168 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
4431169 i think it is very unlikely that the whole thing will be repealed i am not optimistic though i welcome the fact that he obama is for repealing it
4431170 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4431171 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4431172 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4431173 we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4431174 as a house member from 1983 1995 ridge cast votes for a nuclear freeze and against the mx and trident ballistic missiles reagans strategic defense initiative and aid to the contras in nicaragua
4431175 its time to resolve one of our most divisive defense issues the strategic defense initiative sdi
4431176 sold to the american people as a way to make nuclear weapons obsolete sdi was still portrayed by president reagan last year as a defensive weapon that would make it virtually impossible for nuclear missiles to get through as former sen john tower acknowledged that vision is unrealistic frankly there has been a lot of dreaming that achieved a degree of acceptance because it was done in high places by people who know something about defense its left us with a serious defense problem
4431177 governor ridge is proud of his record and support of our nations defense while the governor voted to support elaborate weapons systems he also did not want to do so to the neglect of the soldier in the field

4431191 manager review is a dynamic and iterative process the due diligence never ends what we find amazing is the value added of a fohf manager is often put in doubt or the extra layer of fees determined as excessive and or unnecessary this is in our opinion a paradox on the one hand investors agree that seeing hundreds of hedge fund managers on a regular basis is important yet on the other hand they postulate that fohf managers do not add value who else is in the position of doing the due diligence other than experienced and prudent investment professionals who are in the loop of information flow the industry itself is opaque i e information does not flow efficiently and so scarce resources must be expended to find and analyze the information we doubt that the information advantage of a top quartile fohfs manager over a less informed investor will deteriorate
4431192 in single hedge fund strategies there is clearly an opportunity to generate stronger returns simply because it is a more focused type of strategy on the other hand there is more risk involved furthermore fohfs are supposed to have a high level of expertise as well as the ability to spread large amounts of assets over a number of hedge funds which limits risk so in exchange for slightly lower returns you are getting an entirely different risk profile
4431193 institutional investors are moving away from investing in three or four core hedge fohfs because of the overlap in their underlying portfolios institutions are replacing one or two of these core managers with specialty niche managers in order to diversify and improve performance
4431194 conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
4431195 the subsidiaries failed adequately to supervise the business of the scg and did not act in a timely way on the concerns they had identified about the pricing of certain asset backed positions
4431196 we intend to take a series of steps to liquidate the fund and redeem all fund investors at the same pace
4431197 after labor day we will commence a sell down of the funds security holdings in order to raise cash to fund redemptions
4431198 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4431199 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4431200 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4431201 thats the thing florida has five guys with acls already
4431202 it just comes with the territory of playing football its a physical sport its a fast sport it separates the men from the boys youre going to get hurt sometimes you dont know how things happen or why
4431203 it kind of breaks your heart you feel bad for the kids
4431204 it just makes you realize you have to be grateful for the opportunity to play and take advantage of those opportunities my heart goes out to those guys
4431205 jon major is lucky he has a redshirt year but iltis was probably going to play this year and drew hudgins has had a string of bad luck
4431206 you cant really think about injuries usually when youre thinking about it is when you go get hurt so you just have to go out and play
4431207 there are a lot worse things that could have happened and as far as the timing this is probably the best it could be
4431208 if i was a junior id just be frustrated but this is an opportunity to develop more mentally and physically
4431209 mounting concerns over global growth led to an abrupt sell off in energy prices shortly after reaching new record highs
4431210 the most significant losses were booked in natural gas as a mild u s summer and recovering inventories exacerbated the decline favorable weather conditions and demand concerns also hurt our positions in cocoa and corn
4431211 the interest rate sector added to this months losses as falling australian and u k short term rates had a negative impact on our short positions
4431212 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4431213 we look forward to working with them as our board continues its ongoing efforts to enhance stockholder value
4431214 now icahn biondi and chapple can vote as a block although they wont be able to block anything outright on the 11 member board but they are not there to block anything really they are there to approve and encourage another deal that results in the sale of yahoo
4431215 even as weve had to examine what were trying to do because we go to schools and we do weapons awareness training telling kids the affects of carrying a knife or a gun we have to sit back and think have we gone too far
4431216 are we in danger of making it more popular for our young people to pick up a weapon
4431217 im not necessarily going to agree that it was the wrong thing to do
4431218 but the public perception was quite clear to me and it is that that has prompted me to review the way we do such presentations in the future
4431219 we could be forced to go back to the drawing board
4431220 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4431221 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4431222 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4431223 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4431224 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4431225 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4431231 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4431232 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4431233 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4431234 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take

4431443 if it be asked what is to restrain the house of representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society i answer the genius of the whole system the nature of just and constitutional laws and above all the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of america a spirit which nourishes freedom and in return is nourished by it
4431444 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4431445 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4431446 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4431447 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4431448 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4431449 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4431450 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4431451 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4431452 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4431453 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4431454 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4431455 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4431456 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4431457 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4431458 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4431459 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4431460 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4431461 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4431462 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4431463 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4431464 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4431465 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4431466 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4431467 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4431468 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4431469 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4431470 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4431471 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4431472 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4431473 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4431474 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4431475 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4431476 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4431477 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4431478 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4431479 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4431480 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4431481 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4431482 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4431483 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4431484 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4431485 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4431486 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4431487 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4431488 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4431489 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4431490 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4431491 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4431492 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4431493 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4431494 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4431495 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4431496 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4431497 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4431498 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4431499 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4431500 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4431501 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4431502 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4431503 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4431504 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4431505 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4431506 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4431507 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4431508 jewnigger get the fuck out of here those are not blogs
4431509 lamenta a ideia que os jogadores espanh is tiveram num jogos onde se quer a uni o
4431510 you can forget about any discussion of georgias territorial integrity
4431511 the logic of forcing south ossetia and abkhazia to return to being part of the georgian state
4431512 trust me with the uss new homeland security measures you dont have to worry about many more terrorist strikes
4431513 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
4431514 it is not time to get up close your eyes and i will come get you when it is time mommy is very angry right now i dont want to hear another peep from you do you understand
4431515 even as weve had to examine what were trying to do because we go to schools and we do weapons awareness training telling kids the affects of carrying a knife or a gun we have to sit back and think have we gone too far
4431516 are we in danger of making it more popular for our young people to pick up a weapon
4431517 im not necessarily going to agree that it was the wrong thing to do
4431518 but the public perception was quite clear to me and it is that that has prompted me to review the way we do such presentations in the future
4431519 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4431520 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4431521 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4431522 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4431523 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4431524 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4431525 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4431526 estoy muy ilusionado vamos a dar todo por ganar la medalla de oro en los juegos

4431529 one concern is what do they actually know hopefully they know more than what theyve indicated the other concern is why they deem this information not appropriate to give out
4431530 it is not a question that theres any need or attempt to hide anything due process is going on right now in thailand all the facts will come out in due process
4431531 somebody dies in mexico somebody dies here somebody dies there they dont care
4431532 theyre our canadian people theyve got to stick up for people
4431533 if she does her personal best in each event shes going to score 6 543 and i would take my chances on that it statistically would be sufficient for at least a bronze
4431534 shes 100 per cent healthy its no problem with her health she did feel some pressure earlier in the year but shes physically fitter than ever
4431535 youll be able to see the coat from the outside in the evening youll be able to see it when the theaters closed 24 7 itll be a really signature element
4431536 abraham lincoln became abraham lincoln when he lived in washington
4431537 thats when he became the man that we all know prior to that he was a prairie lawyer and a one term congressman
4431538 unfortunately we have a double homicide the shooting occurred about 10 the identities of the victims have not been released the motive is still unclear of course were asking around for witnesses or anything like that
4431539 people die every day thats how i see it you got to go one day and thats their time to go
4431540 maybe because ive been around it all my life it aint no big deal
4431541 i dont know who got killed or none of that
4431542 hes just trying to say its basically an everyday thing
4431543 he just looks at it like okay tomorrow everything be back to normal
4431544 i did not even have a moment to relish that i was a candidate
4431545 im sensing some resistance and hesitation for people to embrace change
4431546 theyre very active and very sincere folks but some of the people i talked with didnt even know what precinct they vote in
4431547 all of a sudden theyre active good im glad but some might say they should not start at the top
4431548 i wouldnt be going there if they city officials hadnt agreed
4431549 get changed first then come through to my dressing room
4431550 kame this is really important to me and its taken me a lot of courage to be able to say it so please listen carefully okay
4431551 thats okay i kind of thought so you being gay changes absolutely nothing between us
4431552 im so shocked at the moment i cant think i cant reply to you
4431553 gaki san can you give me half an hour to think about this
4431554 gaki san ive never been confessed to by a girl before heck ive never been confessed to by a guy before
4431555 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
4431556 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
4431557 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
4431558 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
4431559 ahh risa chan good morning i arrived early so i thought that id get us breakfast
4431560 risa chan how long do you plan to stare at me
4431561 eri youve got a drop of maple syrup on your chin
4431562 i know that but isnt there anything that you want to do
4431563 well i was thinking since we dont really have to do anything today that maybe we could go for a walk
4431564 a walk sounds nice ive not just wandered around for a while now
4431565 i think that your role as the prince in the musical really rubbed off on you
4431566 shes probably annoyed that she has to come here today when she doesnt really need to
4431567 well ill leave you two alone for the next week i have something of my own to do as well
4431568 theyre like pools of diamonds sparkly pretty rare and unbeatable
4431569 well ill leave you two alone for the next week i have something of my own to do as well
4431570 theyre like pools of diamonds sparkly pretty rare and unbeatable
4431571 a big high and then six outs away from even a higher high
4431572 we do what we need to do to win weve lived the last four years for that one moment in time this is a game of relaxed skills
4431573 we have such great games with them and it does go either way
4431574 one thats in a coma is a daughter of a neighbour a few houses down we know them all
4431575 its very very difficult on a lot of people it will basically shut down the community for a few days especially around the funeral time
4431576 i was at home this evening and one of my sister in laws came in and told me about it it was my niece actually that came upon the accident and had to identify the individuals there and she works for them so it was very tragic for her as well
4431577 we cant really determine what the cause of the collision is at this time
4431578 our reconstructionist is on the scene and hes gathering all the information that he can so that we can try and make a determination as to what happened
4431579 were going to wait and find out what any autopsy or investigation can tell us
4431580 one stopped and actually went into the dugout and pulled one of the victims out of the car and brought him to shore
4431581 theres going to be a lot of people that will need counselling and probably other kinds of help
4431582 winners of seven of its last eight and eight straight road games florida on the other hand is 13 14 since july 18 with 18 of those games being decided by three runs or fewer
4431583 the marlins do have one thing on their side however theyve won 12 of their last 14 games against the cubs
4431584 door verdere kostenbesparingen op de redactie van de krant af te wentelen loopt het vlaggenschip van dit concern zware averij op
4431585 hiermee zou op termijn niet alleen de werkgelegenheid van de redactie van de telegraaf op het spel komen te staan maar dreigt ook het voortbestaan van tmg in gevaar te worden gebracht
4431586 een verdere teruggang in mankracht dan al eerder is afgesproken is volgens de redactieraad absoluut onverantwoord en ontoelaatbaar
4431587 hiermee zou de kwaliteit van de krant ernstig worden aangetast
4431588 we kunnen niet meer met zekerheid zeggen wie de aanstichter was
4431589 since reaching a season best 10 games over 500 on may 26 the marlins have been 33 39 that is an awfully long time to be mediocre at best
4431590 florida is 13 14 since the all star break and the path gets no easier with three games on deck here against the best team in the league the cubs followed by a nine game road trip
4431591 bogatsu knew or ought to have known when buying the machine that the machine was an old model he therefore reasonably foresaw the consequences of purchasing for the project an old machine

4431595 it is due to the harsh climate growing crops was a problem due to long spells of drought
4431596 we have enough to eat and we are now selling some of it especially cabbages carrots and snow peas and the business is improving daily
4431597 the project will enable people to be self reliant in food production which will significantly reduce poverty levels and improve food security among households
4431598 my farm is valued at sh450 000 i bought it for sh40 000 and it is hard to get a farmer selling land here unlike before
4431599 i never thought land would be of any value here what we have seen is a miracle
4431600 im planning to start dairy farming to improve my income since i can grow enough pasture to feed the animals
4431601 because of walking long distances to the forest the cows cannot produce enough milk they are a poor breed and my plan is to sell them and buy a better breed for zero grazing
4431602 now most of them have applied to be connected but they must first fulfil conditions set by others who pioneered the project
4431603 we do it that way because thats the way we do it

4431632 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
4431633 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
4431634 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
4431635 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
4431636 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
4431637 its difficult the heat takes some getting used to and then theres the coldness indoors you need to be prepared to have sweat pouring down your back but once youre used to it and if youre wearing the right clothes then its ok
4431638 the consumer can put together flights with one airline and the other combine fares between one and the other frequent flier programmes will be combined so it offers the consumer more choice a wider network greater flexibility great news
4431639 with this team i dont think nervous is even a factor until you get a couple of outs in the seventh
4431640 i really felt that in the canada game we needed someone to come out there and throw zeroes up until we could get the bats going
4431641 and the way cats been pitching i figured we could count on her to come through
4431642 i was ready to go if he needed me against japan and he changed things up at the last second which was fine we just have to all be ready at any point in time there are only three of us pitchers its all about matchups right now and who theyre throwing
4431643 but i felt good out there on the mound weve played canada enough times and i know their hitters really well i felt like i was on a roll with them if we got one run and went ahead that would be ok but we obviously went ahead and put quite a few on the board
4431644 its not that we dont think about ever losing its just that we know what were capable of doing in the fifth inning you still have two at bats to go and we have a deep enough lineup that you cant get through 1 9 in our lineup without facing 1 9 good hitters
4431645 were not really dominant like people say we are we play a lot of competitive tournaments all around the world every year the difference is that the only time people really pay attention and see is in the olympics and we were dominant in athens we were flat out the best team
4431646 obviously we know that we have a bulls eye on our back all the time and the good thing is that we have athletes who thrive on that theyre very competitive and they understand the history of this program and do their part to prepare themselves thats why theyre in that uniform because theyre ready
4431647 we need to understand what the international agreement is all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4431648 we georgians ossetians and russians all used to live together of course there were some problems but we lived together my house had eight rooms but now i have lost it it has been destroyed
4431649 were playing well and were winning and thats all im worried about right now
4431650 i know japan didnt throw its nos 1 or 2 pitchers but we did what we had to do im not surprised by our power its always been there but pitching has been the key for us at this stage we just need to stay healthy and keep our mind set where its at
4431651 our offense put some runs on the board they were ready to go
4431652 and i knew i just wanted to keep getting them back in the dugout so they could keep doing what they were doing
4431653 i went back and watched tapes from the past three years last night and just tried to slow things down at the plate
4431654 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4431655 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4431656 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4431657 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4431658 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4431659 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4431660 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4431663 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4431664 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4431665 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4431666 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4431667 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4431668 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today

4431672 itll be an adventure for the kids and we want it to be fun but at the same time the kids will hopefully take some things home and apply it and share it and create a lifestyle that will be more environmentally conscious
4431673 its taken seven months to get the air conditioning replaced at a facility that houses some very ill children and i think it speaks highly of the problems we face in terms of dealing with these kind of day in and day out annoyances that makes our job even more difficult

4431682 in todays climate taking large numbers of clients to shoots costing as much as 30 000 was probably a non starter on pr grounds
4431683 were aware of shoots normally full and difficult to get into that are now offering days there will be some days coming back on the market discounted
4431684 its not going to make any difference for the guys that come in their own private jets but certainly at the lower end of the market there seems to be a bit of a slow down

4431690 given the important relationship of distance to data rate we based our model on information on cable lengths from a real network
4431691 we concluded that in our idealised environment capacities can further improve compared to todays deployments
4431692 we found that if the upstream modem is hosted in the exchange households within 2km of the exchange approximately 18 per cent of the total number of households could in theory receive data rates above 50mbit s
4431693 if the upstream modem is moved closer to the customer premises and into the street cabinet then almost 100 per cent of households are within 2km of the street cabinet and could theoretically expect a data rate of 50mbit s
4431694 these results are theoretical and do not reflect what could be achieved in practise
4431695 data rates experienced by end users depend not only on the distance between the customer premises and the exchange but also on home wiring and interference at the exchange cabinet and in the home
4431696 in the real world there are different providers with different equipment sharing the exchange and perhaps the cabinet and therefore impacting performance
4431697 nevertheless the real value of this study is to suggest an upper limit given all technical progress possible of 50mbit s with fibre to the cabinet

4431780 we may not hold a doctrine or seek an experience except in christ
4431781 any work that exalts the holy ghost or gifts above jesus will finally end up in fanaticism whatever causes us to exalt and love jesus is well and safe the reverse will ruin all the holy ghost is a great light but focused on jesus always for his revealing
4431782 where the holy ghost is actually in control jesus is proclaimed the head the holy ghost his executive
4431783 the temptation seems to be toward empty manifestations this does not require any particular cross or death to the self life hence it is always popular
4431784 we may not put power gifts the holy ghost or in fact anything ahead of jesus any mission that exalts even the holy ghost above the lord jesus christ is bound for the rocks of error and fanaticism
4431785 there seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that jesus was all in all the work of calvary the atonement must be the center for our consideration the holy ghost will never draw our attention from christ to himself but rather reveal christ in a fuller way we are in danger of slighting jesus getting him lost in the temple by the exaltation of the holy ghost and of the gifts of the spirit jesus must be the center of everything
4431786 where two or three have gathered together in my name there i am in their midst
4431787 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the pre eminence
4431788 that in all things he might have the pre eminence
4431789 this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
4431790 the spirit descended bodily like a dove but the focus was on the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world not the dove but the lamb
4431791 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
4431792 when he the spirit of truth is come he shall not speak of himself he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you
4431793 he will show you my glory my power my kingdom he will remind you of all my words
4431794 why ask god for what he has already promised just get hold of the promises and simply command deliverances
4431795 oh god where can i find an evangelist who doesnt care about money or who is not promoting something
4431796 the shame of this generation is that we have too many talented men of god and only a few who have touched god in prayer
4431797 this is such a busy age l have no time to pray
4431798 those who want power line up to my right those who want purity line up to my left
4431799 god giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us purifying their hearts by faith
4431800 the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
4431801 what can my faith get me what miracle will he perform for me
4431802 how shall i stand before him how shall i make it at the judgment
4431803 how do i feel how do i get happiness how do i get the desire of my heart
4431804 can i withstand that moment when i stand before the judgment seat of christ how can i withstand when ive lived so carelessly so selfishly so neglectful of his great salvation
4431805 malachi 3 3 kjv god is going to accomplish that by
4431806 the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up
4431807 two young moravians heard of an island in the west indies where an atheist british owner had 2000 to 3000 slaves
4431808 no preacher no clergyman will ever stay on this island if hes shipwrecked well keep him in a separate house until he has to leave but hes never going to talk to any of us about god im through with all that nonsense
4431809 may the lamb that was slain receive the reward of his suffering
4431810 what i make happen for others god will make happen for me
4431811 when the real fire of my spirit comes the seekers will come too

4431817 flying under the radar laboring in obscurity with very little visible progress are going to come to the forefront with a word of healing encouragement and restoration

4431819 i believe as you wear this bracelet this awesome power will flow through to you
4431820 i need you to fill out the prayer card and rush it back to me when i receive your prayer card and your prayer request i will rush you the second step in this process i will also send you the bracelet i would like you to wear for 40 days the most important part of this process after prayer is education let me show you how to access the power within yourself i am asking you to sow a seed of 35 00 today and i will rush you a very special gift
4431821 tribulation works patience patience experience and experience hope and hope does not make ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
4431822 when the waves of my presence seem to pull back it signals a time for you to prepare for the next wave that is about to come so prepare prepare prepare for the next wave is coming it is coming dont let it catch you off guard
4431823 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
4431824 one of the hardest tests we must pass in waiting on god to move is to not be distracted by other things god is doing its hard to resist the pressure of even joining other successful moves of god especially when well meaning people suggest you are missing god by not doing so we must learn to give ourselves only to what god called us to especially if he has us in a season of waiting on him not doing so yielding to pressure from others brings forth ishmaels and absaloms god may bless our ishmaels but they never will become gods real purpose for our lives
4431825 we got what we wanted but we lost what we had

4431832 many women tell me they dont understand the appeal of baseball becauseits
4431833 the game of baseball is not unlike a lifelong well worn comfortable love affair after a time you know what to expect but you can never predict what will happen you also learn how to forgive
4431834 for many women the sex appeal of baseball players is what brings them to the majors
4431835 through close attention to the game women begin to appreciate a masculinity defined not by muscles or money but by hard work and humility baseball players are men after all who sublimate the more primitive characteristics encouraged in other sports aggression rage dominance in favor of something approaching grace whether that be the lift of a soaring well hit left field single or the determination of a batter who fouls off one nasty slider after another

4431843 that normal people develop symptoms normally associated with cardiovascular disease
4431844 one hour after they drank red bull their cardiovascular systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4431845 if you get an increase in stickiness and a decreased ability of the blood vessels to stop its stickiness that adds up to a bad situation
4431846 if you add in other risk factors for cardiovascular disease stress or high blood pressure this could be potentially deadly

4431869 and that melrose fire department guidelines are different than the police department and village departments because we are not paid employees we are volunteers you cant fire a volunteer where you can fire an employee
4431870 we dont feel like we did anything wrong besides support a young man that wanted to help himself and do whats right
4431871 he has come to me every time and let me know what was going on he has been forthright with me every time and everything he has said to me has had merit he has been nothing but a very good volunteer for us

4431883 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4431884 totally baseless and malicious recent spate of unsubstantiated news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf was resigning
4431885 such unsubstantiated reports were creating uncertainty and negatively impacting the economy of the country
4431886 his close aides approached the government and were clearly told that the only way to avoid impeachment is to step down the government does not want him to remain in the presidency
4431887 ik ben niet gelukkig met het toernooiverloop de olympische spelen waren een van mijn doelen dit is dan ook een grote teleurstelling

4431893 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4431894 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4431895 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4431896 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4431897 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4431898 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4431899 hat mich mein leben lang inspiriert und mir immer wieder kraft gegeben mit den unzul nglichkeiten des alltags fertig zu werden
4431900 eric slowhand clapton kollektive streicheleinheiten sir eric clapton ist auf deutschland tour und feiert in der arena in leipzig seinen tourauftakt auf der b hne transportiert er statt buntem show gehabe echte handarbeit und st rzt sich in einen echten blues rausch
4431901 obviously we know we have a bullseye on our back all the time and the good thing is you have athletes that thrive on that theyre very competitive athletes and they understand the history of this program and do their part to prepare themselves and thats why theyre in that uniform because theyre ready
4431902 most kids feel that sense of urgency when they get down and if you can bring it to the ballpark when its even you have a chance of being successful but if you constantly wait until you get down and make that a habit that can get you in trouble
4431903 nah nervous probably starts when its 1 nothing in the seventh
4431904 were never thinking were going to lose it was only the fourth inning there was still a lot of ball left to play for our team and our lineup produces runs unlike any other
4431905 we knew it was just a matter of time and we knew we had a few innings to deal with it and if you give this team a few innings we can be really dangerous
4431906 a gente j fez uma previs o o vald via era um dos que poderiam sair e nos preparamos o que importante manter a competitividade da equipe sem o vald via muda se um pouco o estilo mas a equipe torna se competitiva de maneira igual esse o grande objetivo
4431907 voc n o acha um jogador igual ao vald via porque ele tem a caracter stica dele nico mas n o vai ser contratado nenhum jogador deste n vel neste momento acreditamos que n o h necessidade
4431908 no futuro algum dolo pode ser revelado ou n s buscarmos algu m para isso mas n o agora
4431909 se a venda n o acontecer continuamos com uma equipe forte com o vald via e todos os outros jogadores
4431910 esses epis dios n o influenciam em nada n o seria profissional analisarmos um jogador por causa das ltimas indisciplinas
4431911 temos um bom time mas perdemos os jogos nos minutos finais temos qualidade mas n o conseguimos segurar no final esse o problema de ter jogadoras jovens
4431912 este time novo perdemos um jogo na prorroga o e estivemos perto contra let nia e r ssia estamos jogando juntas h um ano tivemos uma boa prepara o e fizemos bons amistosos apenas perdemos nossos jogos aqui apesar de termos jogado em um bom n vel
4431913 temos que manter calma nos minutos finais estivemos frente no placar mas perdemos jogos nos ltimos minutos nos outros times h jogadoras com 30 ou 35 anos elas j disputaram outros jogos ol mpicos e s o mais experientes
4431914 i think we could have gone up after the match was tied at 5 5 in the first set but we failed to keep our momentum and im frustrated that we werent able to keep our services and let the tide drift away
4431915 oh my gosh ive been up until 12 30 in the morning almost every night
4431916 but we watch it live and record it so we can go back and watch it again later
4431917 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4431918 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4431919 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4431920 its what everybody talks about when they come into the pool
4431921 weve talked about the relay where we beat france and how far michael phelps torpedoes under the water doing dolphin kicks when the rest of the swimmers are already above water and hes still down there looking up at them it just makes people more excited about swimming especially the young ones who are just learning
4431922 i just learned how to dive off the side and im practicing diving off the blocks now
4431923 this year i started to become fast and sometimes when im in a good mood and a happy mood and a confident mood i try to swim fast and good like michael phelps
4431924 usually id be out doing other things playing sports with friends or going to see a movie
4431925 but ive been staying in to watch the olympics just to see michael
4431926 i dont want someone to tell me the next day what happened i want to experience it first
4431927 to know someone just going to the olympics is so absolutely incredible and exciting but this is just hard to explain its so motivational and hes just so michael
4431928 i think the visual of seeing so much excitement about swimming combined with higher summer temperatures it makes people think about having a pool
4431929 im feeling very tired the first time around i could put my feet up and relax this time i have a baby to run after and carry

4431940 one concern is what do they actually know hopefully they know more than what theyve indicated the other concern is why they deem this information not appropriate to give out
4431941 it is not a question that theres any need or attempt to hide anything due process is going on right now in thailand all the facts will come out in due process
4431942 somebody dies in mexico somebody dies here somebody dies there they dont care
4431943 one thats in a coma is a daughter of a neighbour a few houses down we know them all
4431944 its very very difficult on a lot of people it will basically shut down the community for a few days especially around the funeral time
4431945 i was at home this evening and one of my sister in laws came in and told me about it it was my niece actually that came upon the accident and had to identify the individuals there and she works for them so it was very tragic for her as well
4431946 we cant really determine what the cause of the collision is at this time
4431947 our reconstructionist is on the scene and hes gathering all the information that he can so that we can try and make a determination as to what happened
4431948 were going to wait and find out what any autopsy or investigation can tell us
4431949 one stopped and actually went into the dugout and pulled one of the victims out of the car and brought him to shore
4431950 theres going to be a lot of people that will need counselling and probably other kinds of help
4431951 if she does her personal best in each event shes going to score 6 543 and i would take my chances on that it statistically would be sufficient for at least a bronze
4431952 my start was pretty good i just got out pretty well and just didnt hit it as hard going into the end because its the first round so i wanted to save a little energy for the quarter finals
4431953 shes 100 per cent healthy its no problem with her health she did feel some pressure earlier in the year but shes physically fitter than ever
4431954 aristotle and an aardvark go to washington understanding political doublespeak through philosophy and jokes
4431955 we will keep competing for as long as we can
4431956 i dont think thats true we keep a balance between physical and mental strength
4431957 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this for the next time
4431958 you cant have a major tournament without criticism but i am satisfied that we have so far had the right winner on each occasion
4431959 ik moet een gaatje boren van 8mm dus ik wil graag een boortje van 3 mm en van 5mm

4431983 se vislumbra un acontecimiento todo el mundo est contento y hay una gran expectativa
4431984 lo que se comenta en la calle es que todo el mundo se va para el cine ese d a hoy
4431985 no estoy pendiente de eso lo que me interesa es sentar otro tipo de precedente
4431986 estar metido dentro del g nero urbano y sacar a la vez una pel cula y una banda sonora de 15 canciones originales es algo hist rico porque no se hab a hecho nunca en el ambiente latino
4431987 ahora mismo estamos trabajando en las licencias con estados unidos para saber cu ndo se presentar la pel cula por ac
4431988 es una nueva faceta como digo en mis letras daddy yankee no es un cantante sino un movimiento
4431989 estoy buscando siempre reinventarme hacer cosas nuevas y ofrecerle al p blico algo no ha visto antes presentar un paquete completo con m sica y pel cula es la mejor muestra de ello
4431990 es una cosa distinta combina la m sica electr nica europea el hip hop el songo latino y el reggaet n
4431991 metemos cuatro g neros distintos en un solo tema y este ha tenido una gran aceptaci n en mi pa s porque se ha convertido en el n mero uno yo no me amarro a un solo estilo y esto demuestra mi versatilidad
4431992 soy una esponja recojo de todo tipo de m sica porque mi o do es internacional
4431993 me gustan mucho paul van dyk tiesto y bad boy bill
4431994 no puedo decir lo que voy a hacer en el futuro porque trabajo a trav s de la vibra
4431995 escucho un estilo musical que me gusta y lo puedo fusionar con mi onda urbana me gusta dejarme llevar por lo que me transmite la m sica en el momento creo que la mejor manera de hacer arte es guiarse por el coraz n
4431996 se trata de tomar decisiones personales y de evolucionar por cuenta propia
4431997 cuando salgo a la calle lo que m s se escucha son el reggat n y la bachata quieran aceptarlo o no
4431998 si la difusi n radial ha disminu do no es porque la m sica no d rating sino porque los auspiciadores no quieren ser identificados con este g nero por lo que las radioemisoras no logran vender los espacios
4431999 es una mentira que ha corrido por ah porque las ventas los conciertos y el apoyo de la gente se encargan de demostrar la verdad
4432000 y es algo que ocurre no s lo en puerto rico sino tambi n en sudam rica en centroam rica y en estados unidos
4432001 lo que pasa es que lamentablemente el g nero sufre una persecuci n constante hay algunos que lo quieren eliminar cuando no se puede eliminar al pueblo
4432002 es un vivo ejemplo del modo en que la gente favorece a una canci n a pesar de que no tiene difusi n radial porque se ha convertido en uno de los temas m s fuertes en mi show
4432003 me ha sorprendido mucho la recepci n que ha tenido
4432004 vengo de la calle y escribo de mis vivencias nunca he negado mis ra ces y mis ra ces se encuentran en el barrio la gente se identifica conmigo porque sabe que soy un l der del barrio

4432006 el arreglo fue trabajado por music logo que es mi productor y por elvis crespo que es uno de los merengueros m s grandes que existen
4432007 elvis es un tipo de lo m s creativo se sent con mi productor y los dos sacaron una bomba
4432008 hicieron un trabajo en conjunto que fue muy ch vere
4432009 fue un proyecto local en el que se me dio una oportunidad que no quise desaprovechar
4432010 me permiti darme cuenta de que ten a el potencial para ser actor y es por eso que decid hacer como protagonista talento de barrio una pel cula de la que soy tambi n productor ejecutivo conf o mucho en m y me gustan los retos
4432011 no es mi vida pero no deja de mostrar sucesos reales representados por actores del barrio que atravesaron situaciones parecidas
4432012 lo que se presenta es el pan de cada d a para los que vienen de la calle
4432013 ayuda al pueblo y considera que lo que est haciendo es justo porque no tiene otro modo de sobrevivir
4432014 pero l mismo se motiva para cambiar cuando descubre que tiene un talento muy especial y aunque logra hacerlo el pasado no lo deja escapar tan f cilmente
4432015 pero la pel cula no es un musical a pesar de que contiene mucha m sica
4432016 en este proyecto ten a todav a que tenderle un lazo a mi audiencia porque representa un paso de transici n voy a seguir actuando y llegar un momento en el que el p blico separar al daddy yankee actor del daddy yankee cantante

4432018 this survey could give some hints if us consumers are able to drag the economy out of the mud
4432019 they will eventually start cutting rates from the early part of next year and that will be a key factor which will contribute to more euro weakness
4432020 we probably have seen the top of the euro at 1 60
4432021 were not convinced that we will see any interest rate hikes in the us this year which will ultimately disappoint the markets
4432022 bonterra trusts long term business strategy has been to combine its oil and gas production technical strengths with planned business strategies to generate above average results and returns for unitholders however since the october 31 2006 announcement and subsequent legislation by the canadian federal government with respect to trust taxation bonterra trust has been of the opinion that the trust structure is no longer capable of providing maximum value to unitholders

4432024 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
4432025 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud

4432037 after doing all of these collaborations i finally realized that i cant keep doing this
4432038 it was fun working with all of these different artists but i need to do the band thing thats whats most important to me
4432039 ill admit that we were kind of stagnating as a trio outside people were needed to get the creativity going but i needed to get back with these guys it was time after working with some incredible players
4432040 i think all the people i worked with were great but it was time to get back where im from
4432041 weve touched a number of bases with this album i needed to be eclectic
4432042 im just growing as a writer theres room for fun songs like cold beverage but with this album i think im turning a page as a writer when i wrote peace love and happiness i realized that this works on some different levels its an upbeat song but its more than a party tune
4432043 i love playing live the studio is fine but its a controlled environment you could have the perfect arrangement the perfect guitar solo but that all goes out the window when you play live
4432044 things happen when you get up there onstage there is all of that energy its an exciting thing particularly when youre out with bandmates youve known forever
4432045 being in a band is like having an extra girlfriend
4432046 you have to work at it to make it work im just so glad we got back together because its an important relationship to me its something that i and my music need

4432098 el pp ha ofrecido su colaboraci n al gobierno pero
4432099 plantearemos el debate una a una para que el gobierno diga por qu no las acepta pero desde luego la oposici n ha cumplido con su obligaci n ha hecho propuestas y adem s le ha ofrecido colaboraci n en este asunto
4432100 un capit n que no sabe lo que tiene entre manos
4432101 incapaz de fijar prioridades y tomar decisiones para abordar una crisis econ mica galopante
4432102 es un gobierno antiguo que adem s est dividido muy desorientado y que no sabe qu hacer enfatiz y as es imposible generar confianza
4432103 en este momento tocan esas medidas que habr a que hacerlas por decreto ley y urgentemente
4432104 no tiene sentido decir que va a regalar 49 millones de bombillas
4432105 al menos hay que plantearlo porque si no la dependencia energ tica ser mayor
4432106 sue o con ganar una medalla y me he preparado durante dos meses para conseguirla me gustar a revivir lo de hace ocho a os cuando tuve un recibimiento extraordinario al volver con la plata en la prueba de puntos aquel recuerdo no se me va a borrar nunca es dif cil de olvidar
4432107 si vuelvo a ganar me gustar a vivir algo parecido
4432108 hemos entrenado mejor que nunca hemos tenido todo el apoyo y el material del centro de la uci estoy en buena condici n pero los rivales son duros no s si ganar pero lo voy a dar todo en la pista
4432109 desde que salimos de uruguay tengo la medalla en la mente por eso quiero hacer todo lo mejor posible
4432110 importante para el ciclismo uruguayo y para todo el pa s que necesita alegr as
4432111 el 99 por ciento de los uruguayos est pendiente de lo que suceda en la carrera del s bado por eso ser a muy importante subir al podium
4432112 es una prueba muy dif cil y depende mucho de las circunstancias hay que estar muy atento a todo movimiento ser una carrera muy ajustada los detalles van a ser importantes
4432113 hay que estar muy despierto toda la competici n con la chispa dispuesta en todo momento
4432114 siento la misma presi n que puede sentir cualquier atleta en su deporte siempre con el deseo de hacerlo lo mejor posible
4432115 he participado dos veces en campeonatos mundiales en roma en el 88 y en alemania aachen en 2006
4432116 para este tipo de eventos es un caballo joven la experiencia que tiene a este nivel es la que ha tenido conmigo en los ltimos 6 meses
4432117 sufr un poquito pero estoy all y eso es lo que importa
4432118 sufr un poquito pero estoy all y eso es lo que importa
4432119 los cuatro primeros no fueron malos pero no fueron bien presentados al final que era lo que me dar a mayor puntuaci n
4432120 tienes que esperar mucho en cada clavado tienes que estar concentrada pero no totalmente porque tienes mucho tiempo de descanso
4432121 todas somos muy buenas las 18 tenemos bastante nivel no es f cil la competencia pero yo conf o en que voy a hacerlo y a estar en la final
4432122 llevaba una competencia muy buena y estaba dentro de la semifinal
4432123 hab a sido muy estable en los cuatro primeros saltos y estaba entre las doce primeras pero como que baj un poquito de actividad al final y el ltimo salto me sali muy dif cil eso fue lo que me dej fuera
4432124 raising them here in la is different because i was raised in new york city its totally different
4432125 i grew up in the upper west side of manhattan in the 70s there were fires and riots and serial killers it was great
4432126 llegue a los juegos ol mpicos para estar en las finales y no me conformo con la medalla de bronce
4432127 hice una buena pelea sal decidido a darle con todo
4432128 s que es un gran rival pero estoy preparado para darlo todo en el cuadril tero y seguir en la lucha por la medalla no s lo de bronce luchar por la de oro en la final
4432129 s que todav a puedo ir a m s y lo demostrar
4432130 me hab a estudiado muy bien lo que hizo en su primera pelea y sal con todo para no dejarle reaccionar creo que hice las cosas perfectas
4432131 diosito me debe ayudar para que siga por el camino del triunfo y la lucha de la medalla
4432132 para m no hay la pelea perfecta darleys hizo un gran combate pero dio algunos golpes por fuera que no podr hacer ante el ruso
4432133 sabemos que podemos superar la pr xima prueba pero hay que hacer un buen trabajo y seguir por el camino del sacrificio y la inteligencia
4432134 todo me suena a excusas y antes que nada tenemos que ser deportistas
4432135 tengo una sensaci n extra a por un lado estoy feliz con el diploma ol mpico y por otro siento que pod amos haber logrado un mejor puesto
4432136 contra hungr a no hemos podido hacer tiene un equipo muy fuerte y no nos han dado ninguna opci n
4432137 ha sido un honor competir y representar a venezuela en estos juegos he tenido muchos altibajos en la preparaci n de este torneo ol mpico pero hemos intentado superar todas las dificultades y hacerlo lo mejor posible la experiencia ha sido fant stica
4432138 hice un salto para arriesgar porque no ten a nada que perder
4432139 la ca da siempre es complicada hice un salto para arriesgar porque ya no ten a nada que perder
4432140 es una competici n distinta de s lo un ejercicio y hay tiempo para entrenar
4432141 espero que en la pr xima generaci n haya tambi n chicas buenas y alguna consiga mejorarlo
4432142 no estaba motivado para venir por el tiempo por el calor por el esfuerzo que tiene que hacer el caballo
4432143 los caballos han sufrido mucho viniendo ac el vuelo es lo de menos las condiciones infraestructura son buenas pero eso podr a ser bueno en cualquier lugar pero el tiempo es mal simo para los caballos
4432144 si de todos modos no estamos en pek n mejor hacer la olimpiada en holanda o alemania porque para ir a una olimpiada a un lugar donde s lo estamos nosotros
4432145 camila y pedro tienen mucho talento mucha experiencia est n acostumbrados a la presi n de una competencia como esta pero sobre todo y lo que es m s importante es la unidad que este equipo tiene todos estamos con el mismo objetivo
4432146 que las condiciones clim ticas de hong kong ser an peores pero despu s del tif n
4432147 yo creo que los caballos pasan la mayor parte del d a en condiciones muy buenas
4432148 creo que brasil puede pelear por una medalla de bronce y alcanzar otra
4432149 estoy muy contento de estar con ellos estamos muy motivados no son muy duros con nosotros
4432150 no tengo ninguna duda de que seremos competitivos en cualquier campo aun sabiendo que estamos en el inicio y que hay cosas a mejorar
4432151 el partido de la previa de la champions por ejemplo es complicado y mentiroso yo le doy valor porque s lo dif cil que es y adem s a n no nos hemos clasificado a n debemos viajar a polonia
4432152 prioritario de rendir bien en la vuelta de la champions y de empezar bien la liga
4432153 con la m xima seriedad ante un rival de prestigio internacional porque en el bar a no hay partidos amistosos o menos importantes
4432154 si piensa en el club y en la instituci n no se equivocar
4432155 s que en este club tranquilidad poca y no puedo pretender que la haya porque siempre se generan muchas noticias
4432156 hizo cosas extraordinarias que ojal pudi ramos igualar simplemente son ciclos que se acaban y entre todos nos vamos adaptando
4432157 todos se conforman con ser segundos detr s de hoy pero todos los ciclistas tienen puntos d biles y yo voy a tratar de encontrarlos

4432213 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis
4432214 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4432215 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4432216 wow giant cockroach dont chase it away i want to make a picture of it
4432217 oh i made some friends on my way you know
4432218 you one stop for all of your favorite cheats and glitches from clubpenguin
4432219 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4432220 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4432221 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4432222 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4432223 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4432224 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4432225 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4432226 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4432227 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4432228 i have to say sorry to dpp members and supporters with a heavy heart i let everybody down and caused irreparable damage to the party this was not my intention but i made mistakes

4432230 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4432231 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4432232 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4432233 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide

4432241 the industry is taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and thats a good thing
4432242 the fundamental goal has been to return money into the hands of investors and thats what these deals do

4432248 at its current price of 175 27 per share apples stock is trading at 33 9x our fiscal 2008 estimate of 5 17 we set our six month price target at 184 00 this represents a p e multiple of 35 6x our fiscal 2008 estimate which is still a premium to the industry but more accurately reflects the current outlook
4432249 i believe investors have become overly fixated on apples expected accounting income while ignoring apples impressive free cash flow generating ability free cash flow not earnings reported in the accounting statements determines the true value of a firm
4432250 the price earnings multiple p e is an increasingly useless metric when valuing apple inc
4432251 apples stock price is cheap if you use cgm as your valuation metric
4432252 for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tyre inflation
4432253 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy

4432256 sfi offers the perfect opportunity for a disabled veteran like myself to add to my monthly income i think that this is the best system that i have found to produce an income that will be both growing steadily i am looking forward to building my network and building residual income with sfi
4432257 i have found something at last that has and is proving itself organizationally and materially i could hardly believe the advance sfi commission checks being sent to me after only the first few weeks after joining the program the sky is the limit
4432258 the idea and construction of the sfi network is so simple its ingenious

4432263 im not concerned about the field goals were putting a bunch of points on the board

4432266 calvillo makes his decisions so quick and goes through his progession quicker
4432267 he has a quick release and knows where he wants to go with it that mental aspect allows him to deliver it quicker
4432268 what i love is that hes a gym rat hes in at 6 a m and treats this like a fulltime job he gives us everything and transcends the locker room
4432269 his work ethic is as good as anyones he has it all in perspective and leads the way he works hard at it his workouts are second to none compared to the nfl quarterbacks ive been around its impressive to see how he prepares
4432270 to say im surprised that were winning thats not a huge surprise
4432271 to me im just doing what i have to do to be competitive and be a starting quarterback in this league

4432280 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary

4432296 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4432297 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4432298 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4432299 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4432300 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4432301 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4432302 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4432303 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4432304 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4432306 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
4432307 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
4432308 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
4432309 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
4432310 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
4432311 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
4432312 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
4432313 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
4432314 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph

4432350 setzt ein positives signal dass mein mandant nach so vielen jahren in haft endlich entlassen wird
4432351 ich habe in der haftanstalt angerufen aber wahrscheinlich wird christian klar die entscheidung wie beim gnadengesuch auch aus dem radio erfahren

4432353 die ermittlungen werden unabh ngig von der entscheidung des bundesgerichtshofs ber die beugehaft gegen verena becker und stefan wisniewski weiter gef hrt
4432354 meines wissens nach handelt es sich um spuren eines helms einer jacke und eines handschuhs
4432355 selbst wenn darin verena beckers spuren nicht gefunden wurden bedeutet das noch lange nicht dass sie nicht an der tat beteiligt war
4432356 es kann nicht sein dass man sich in ermittlungen allein auf aussagen von terroristen verl sst
4432357 der staat muss doch auch dazu beitragen dass der mord an meinem vater aufgekl rt wird solange der verfassungsschutz vernehmungsprotokolle von verena becker nicht der bundesanwaltschaft zur verf gung stellt kann nicht die rede davon sein dass alles zur aufkl rung beigetragen wird

4432381 mbna had the foresight to realize that you can locate a successful multinational business on the coast of maine and have the labor force to meet your needs
4432382 they were the pioneers and businesses are going to continue to come
4432383 weve had success because we went out to get it
4432384 hes tenacious smart straightforward he doesnt tell you what you want to hear he tells you what you need to hear
4432385 we often dont know what company they represent during the first round of talks
4432386 we coordinate those visits down to where they will go who they will see what questions they will have about everything from minimum wage to parking questions for local officials
4432387 the fact that we have a trained work force from the mbna days is key if you dont have that nothing else matters
4432388 boston financial got 250 applications right out of the gate and they were tickled with the quality of the applicants
4432389 were in the 200 mile corridor around boston and will continue to attract businesses and jobs from people who dont want to pay the heavy price of doing business in massachusetts
4432390 i was concerned because if there was a place in the state that has them and we dont were done
4432391 in the long term we will build on that number
4432392 we wont face a disaster if any one company leaves
4432393 athenahealth and boston financial are hiring local people to remodel their buildings using maine architects and maine craftspeople landscapers all maine companies
4432394 that has a significant measurable economic impact even this early in the process
4432395 sometimes people turn to the legislature to answer questions that might be better answered at home
4432396 the legislature cant legislate atmosphere it cant legislate the intangibles that make businesses come to this area
4432397 if you look across a broader spectrum its not easy to do business in midcoast maine in a more general sense
4432398 the lines of communication are longer although i used to say this a lot when i represented mbna in the area modern communications are such that you dont need to be sitting in boston or new york to communicate effectively with a lot of your customers
4432399 outlying areas peripheral areas that sell their communities on a clean environment an environment where people care about one another and care about the vibrancy and well being of both the communities and their neighbors is really positive
4432400 but items such as cost to transport things cost in taxes and related levies are high in this area as compared to other parts of the country
4432401 as we look at this stage of the development of the midcoast area balanced change is important and without it will come stagnation
4432402 and with stagnation much fewer opportunities for the young people of this community
4432403 for the good of the community all you really need is for a person like charlie cawley of old to say i like this i like this atmosphere and though on paper it may not seem like the best place to do business i want to do business here
4432404 we thought the people we interacted with in the area were good people with a good work ethic and the likelihood was that they would do well in the jobs that we could bring to the area
4432405 the company felt that it needed to give back to the community and give back to the civic organizations and social organizations that improved the vibrancy and the quality of life for people in the community
4432406 which by extension was good for the people in the company as well
4432407 the consistency of mbnas earnings over the period of time that it was a public company is very very clear
4432408 it was hugely profitable hugely successful very bottom line oriented when you looked at it as a corporation
4432409 the part that isnt known by many people was that mbna was enormously bottom line focused and while the company was benevolent in the largest sense of that word we had a business model that was customer oriented from start to finish
4432410 certainly people could look at the area and say its a lovely area and a nice place to vacation but its much more than that
4432411 the relationships that were developed within this company and by extension within this community will live within all of us for the rest of our lives
4432412 i think that the greatest legacy is the legacy of the youth of the area that i think were affected in a positive way by being involved by being children of people who worked here or by some of the outreach that was done with younger people within this community
4432413 buildings are monuments of a type but thats like going into a cemetery and seeing what was
4432414 i prefer to look at vibrant things to look at people and say that person does great things in this community i feel happy if i could have done anything to support those people
4432415 we learned to be a little calmer in the area here
4432416 we learned that everyone in the midcoast made for a very friendly and wonderful community but they also were our strongest critics that made us a better organization
4432417 what is this business person trying to do are they trying to do something wholesome or not

4432422 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
4432423 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
4432424 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
4432425 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
4432426 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
4432427 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
4432428 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
4432429 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
4432430 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
4432431 there may have been more olympians in 2004 but there were a lot more dead people in iraq too now violence is down 80 those are more important numbers

4432434 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4432435 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4432436 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4432437 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4432438 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4432439 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4432476 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
4432477 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment

4432763 when my boyfriend moved into his current apartment the first thing i noticed was the horrific lighting in the kitchen there was an old style 90s california light panel or whatever they call them basically panels over fluorescents like an office there were cupboards over most of the counters and it was hard to see what you were doing at times a run to ikea solved this i bought two packs of the grundtal spotlights and some long pieces of baseboard moulding and double sided tape from my local hardware store using some nails i attached the base of the lights to the baseboard then hung up the baseboard with double sided tape which has now held successfully for almost two years hes a renter so i didnt want to do anything major there was a little ledge on the underside of the cupboards so it looks like the lights are attached to the cupboards i then attached the halogen portion of the lights clipped the wires and switches up and out of the way and now have some nice task lighting and just nicer than the horrid fluorescent lighting

4432784 agosti 24 bunge lilipitisha kwa kauli moja azimio la kutaka iundwe serikali ya tanganyika ndani ya muungano ili kuwa na muundo wenye serikali tatu na kwa kuwa agosti 6 1994 rais wa jamhuri ya muungano aliwasilisha katika kikao rasmi cha kamati ya wabunge wote wa ccm
4432785 na kwa kuwa kamati ya wabunge wote ililipokea kulijadili na kukubali azimio hilo na kwa kuzingatia katiba sera hii iliwekwa kwenye ilani ya uchaguzi ya ccm kwa ajili ya uchaguzi mkuu wa mwaka 1995 kwa hiyo basi bunge katika mkutano huu wa 16 unaofanyika dar es salaam sasa linaazimia kama ifuatavvyo
4432786 kwa misingi hiyo bunge linafuta azimio lake la agosti 24 1993 lililoelekeza serikali iandae utaratibu wa kuwasilisha bungeni kabla ya aprili 1995 muundo muafaka wa muungano ambao unazingatia haja ya kuwepo serikali ya tanganyika ndani ya muungano

4432804 as far as sea erosion is concerned in the chilika area and in other parts of our coastline experts and scientists are looking at the problem thoroughly and we will do something about all these matters
4432805 i would rather hesitate to dub it as a consequence of global warming there could be multiple causes in fact a detailed study is required to find out the causes we have made a lot of human interventions in the coastal zones in the last two to three decades and this could be one of the causes

4432813 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4432814 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4432815 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4432816 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4432817 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4432818 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4432819 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4432820 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4432821 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4432822 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4432823 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4432824 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4432825 the long and short of it was if the maps werent incorrect i never would have purchased the property in the first place

4432890 our little joanne was one of the liveliest children in the street and was someone who was so full of beans she could not sit still for any moment of the day
4432891 every day was very important to her and she filled each minute of the day being busy at school window shopping which she adored especially as it did not require any money to do or outside playing with her friends
4432892 she was very definitely an outside child and never seemed to have time for indoor things such as computer games and tv watching
4432893 she loved going to school and left home early every morning to make sure she was there in time for the breakfast club and only left school when she had gone to the after school clubs she especially enjoyed sports at school and loved playing football

4433178 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4433179 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4433180 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4433181 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4433182 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4433183 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4433184 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4433185 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4433186 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4433187 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4433188 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4433189 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4433190 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4433191 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4433192 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4433193 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4433194 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4433195 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4433196 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4433197 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4433198 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4433199 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4433200 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4433201 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4433202 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4433203 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4433204 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4433205 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4433206 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4433207 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4433208 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4433209 we were down and i knew i had to start being more aggressive
4433210 i dont know what it was but we werent playing well in the first half
4433211 weve been struggling but have been finding ways to win
4433212 sikkerhedsindustrien glorificerer og opmuntrer til en forkert opf rsel industrien skaber helte ud af sikkerhedsfolk og ser helt bort fra den store gruppe der rettet almindelige bugs som om de overhovedet ikke er vigtige
4433213 faktisk forholder det sig s dan at de almindelige kedelige fejlrettelser er klart vigtigere alene fordi der er mange flere af dem
4433214 jeg synes at openbsd folkene er en flok navlepillende aber der g r et alt for stort nummer ud af sikkerheden de g r det i s dan en grad at intet andet har betydning for dem
4433215 alt for ofte deles s kaldte sikkerhed op i to lejre siger linus thorvalds
4433216 en der tror p lukkethed omkring problemerne og skjuler viden indtil en fejl er l st og n der vil afsl re sikkerhedshuller fordi de ser det som endnu et bevis p at software udgiveren er korrupt

4433219 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves
4433220 sometimes they were so full of people that they put people in the trunks of cars
4433221 i wondered what was going on so i called the state authorities
4433222 human pawns in a scheme by hospitals doctors ambulance companies and others to defraud
4433223 red white and blue let it do what it do
4433224 given a nitroglycerin patch for her non existent cardiopulmonary condition
4433225 these allegations involve individuals in a complex arrangement involving shell companies kickbacks bogus contracts with the people committing fraud and hospitals covering up kickbacks
4433226 and i went with them to the hospital they treated me for my arthritis
4433227 they come down every morning with four or five people they fill up their van and take them to the hospital
4433228 when they come back they give them money sometimes as much as 150 or 200
4433229 you should have thought about that before you decided to not share wealth and be productive for everyones sake
4433230 this is truly an exciting venture as imaging professionals will not only have access to a single bundle of programs but multiple combinations
4433231 having spent several years trying to identify and serve the particular needs of the imaging industry we have become extremely familiar with the importance of specialized tools and were positive that customers of vertus and imagenomic will be very pleased with the pairings of these different programs they will have access to multiple powerful applications and all at a discount that will make the investment that much more feasible
4433232 photographers and art directors are relying on advanced imaging software tools to help provide a cleaner faster and more compelling photography deliverable for their clients and imagenomic is pleased to be a popular solution for many of these creative pros
4433233 we are very excited to work with vertus to bundle our software suite with fluid mask 3 there are distinct advantages to using these tools together as such weve created a super suite that truly enhances the workflow for creative and visual pros

4433237 hopefully in light of this incident the taboo subject of sexual harassment will finally be discussed widely on college campuses

4433242 youd assume that the demographics for this particular film were 18 to 34 year old males
4433243 but we found that lots of phones that were typically marketed to women were being updated too
4433244 despite all the negative reports of the financial sector and the increase in costs worldwide the group management still expects sales and profitability to show solid positive development in the second half year
4433245 we see good double digit growth at the moment at omega
4433246 the only penalty we have today is the exchange rate
4433247 the results were overall a mixed bag sales were slightly worse than expected outlook was solid and underlying profit was better than expected while the financial writedowns were worse than expected
4433248 sales are being driven by asia pacific and north america europe was solid the results should support the stock today
4433249 once more the middle east and asia put in the strongest performance growing by high double digit rates

4433257 the training this year has stepped up a huge amount and my focus in all areas has improved massively notes driving fitness etc the support and structure around me has been fantastic and will play a big part in my preparations for this event
4433258 it was a concert that went on in upstate new york for about three days and had lots of famous bands
4433259 it was also a time for hippies to get together and do drugs there was no sanitation people slept anywhere and they even urinated on each other
4433260 we have helped our customers cut bag use by 40 without a bag tax adding to the cost of their weekly shop in fact our
4433261 our customers have shown us how keen they are to break this environmentally damaging habit of a lifetime the
4433262 it took more than 14 months to save the first billion bags but the second billion was achieved in less than 9 months showing that the trend is rapidly gaining support
4433263 even the most committed greenies occasionally forget to bring their shopping bags with them so there will always be carrier bags available free of charge we want to help our customers remember to reuse their bags rather than punish them when they forget
4433264 essentially the challenge is to the directions given by the rajasthan high court directing production of the child manji yamada by the police though the child and or the guardians are not parties until further orders the child will be in the custody of emiko yamada who is stated to be the grandmother of the child the police will not take any steps for production of the child before the rajasthan high court until further orders
4433265 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world

4433281 all of them are accounted for the leak has been stopped
4433282 the energy level and the way i feel now is great
4433283 sending them to put out a fire in the wilderness is both overkill and unnecessary
4433284 firefighters are being ordered to take significant risks of their lives health and safety that are incommensurate with the benefits of suppression
4433285 those that are in wilderness areas tend to move out of wilderness areas
4433286 we ought to be treating these forests in the winter and the spring not in august
4433287 why are you letting random events dictate how you manage these forests
4433288 right now volunteerism is down nationwide so any time you get some young kids and you think you have an opportunity to train them and keep them we wouldve loved to have kept them
4433289 we wouldve hoped they never would have gotten involved in an activity like this
4433290 ive been chief for 10 years and its the first time ive had to deal with this issue im not going to tolerate it at belle fire department
4433291 he is a juvenile and i dont feel comfortable giving out his name
4433292 hes the only one ive talked to that has actually shown some remorse
4433293 i did not give them an opportunity to explain anything
4433294 i told two of the three theyll have an opportunity to come in and speak to the chief officers of our department and explain the situation if they choose to do so
4433295 i made contact with that individual and told him we were going to begin an investigation and asked if there was any further information he could give us
4433296 at that time he wanted to come clean with what happened
4433297 they set the fire called it in and then went back to the station to jump on the truck to go fight it
4433298 people are acting as if this was a prank but from our position theyre very fortunate the fire did not get further out of hand didnt spread to a house or result in someone being injured or killed
4433299 ive got a good department and it just takes a couple to mess it up
4433300 we have hundreds of volunteer firemen throughout the county they serve with distinction and honor
4433301 this represents a very small segment its disturbing im glad they were arrested
4433302 a lot of times people try to hide this stuff we want to be open with as much information as we can our members are disappointed these three have chosen to do this well bounce back and keep right on chugging along
4433303 the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respect and heard in denver

4433306 dia arif mesra dengan masyarakat setempat dan diterima oleh penduduk jalan sembilang
4433307 kalau nak minta bantuan kepadanya senang dan tanpa tangguh tangguh
4433308 dia tidak pentingkan diri sendiri dia berkawan dengan sesiapapun termasuk semua bangsa tak kira parti politik

4433313 it is a book about charity it is a book about how to love your fellow homeschoolers and how to demonstrate that love it is a book about how to model the virtues of hospitality kindness and patience for your children it gives many excellent suggestions on how to find other homeschoolers but most importantly it gives instruction in how to build a community i homeschooled my own children for 23 years i loved those days and i can honestly say we had a very good time nonetheless i wish i had had this book i love this book and i dont say that lightly it is truly wonderful
4433314 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team weve always been a second half team
4433315 there are kids that were hoping for a couple by now and so we were hoping for the same medals they were
4433316 it hasnt worked out yet but there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that may make up the difference
4433317 with those investments you can buy medals but were not doing that in our country
4433318 the athletes are quite well shielded from the frustration and disappointment in canada
4433319 there is disappointment for sure personal disappointment that they are working so hard and its just not enough
4433320 know that a personal best is not enough to cut it on the world stage and certainly not enough to get them on the podium
4433321 peter donnelly a physical education professor at the university of toronto pointed out that the korea sports council invested about 52 million in each athlete expected to win a gold medal

4433343 it doesnt surprise me that leitrim men have the lowest life expectancy but i am still disappointed
4433344 poverty is the overriding factor in life expectancy as well as the high dependency of men in this area on agriculture and the construction industry for their livelihoods
4433345 they say the life expectancy of a man living alone is greatly reduced
4433346 men have to be looked on as a specific group otherwise they are not being dealt with properly there has to be tailor made innovative programmes for men
4433347 to say that these people do not exist because they do not apply for home improvements is a failure of the agencies charged with looking after the most needy

4433362 dina borzekowski at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of health in baltimore maryland us and her colleagues asked 63 preschoolers aged three to five to sample two meals each consisting of a chicken nugget a quarter of a hamburger french fries two baby carrots and a small cup of milk although both meals came from a local mcdonalds only one of them appeared in its original packaging researchers presented items from the other meal in plain wrappers which lacked the companys distinctive logo in most cases children said they tasted a difference between the two meals and they overwhelmingly preferred the mcdonalds branded foods

4433368 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4433369 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4433370 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4433371 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4433372 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon

4433380 three patients sometimes have to share the same bed and we saw patients lying on the floor with drips in their arms
4433381 theres no shortage of experienced trainers from st marys willing to give up their time free of charge to go out to juba and by building a bungalow well be able to send them for the cost of the airfare
4433382 overheads will be minimal and sending 20 people a year will only cost about 25 000 which is cheaper than any other aid organisation i can think of
4433383 ultimately wed like to attract money from international bodies like the multi donor fund which is part of the world bank and the key to doing this is being able to show we can make a major contribution cheaply

4433540 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4433541 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4433542 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4433543 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4433544 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4433545 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4433546 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer

4433550 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody

4433553 whoever interprets something else from the photos has taken it completely the wrong way
4433554 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4433555 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned

4433581 why not put huan liu chinas top singer without a popular face singing behind the stage and bring some handsome face to move his mouth beside sarah brightman on the stage to boost chinas national interest
4433582 i dont oppose fake singing or so called cooperation but yang didnt get her credit
4433583 why not put singer peiyi yang performer miaoke lin why didnt anyone bring this up in the press conference immediately after the opening ceremony
4433584 uncle zhang the olympic opening director said my voice is splendid
4433585 all the faults belong to peiyi yang she stirred up the conflicts why wasnt she born to a powerful family shes from a grass root family but with a golden voice if she were from a national leaders family or at least had some powerful relatives but still with your face i bet nobody dare to bully her her talent would have put her on the stage instead of playing the hero behind the stage

4433594 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4433595 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4433596 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4433608 paul lieber paul ich hab sehnsucht nach dir und unserem m rchen

4433610 ich sollte ein schloss f r uns haben und dich zu mir holen damit du mein verwunschener herr drin sein kannst wir werden viele teppiche drin haben und musik und die liebe erfinden
4433611 die zeit und vieles ist gegen uns aber sie soll nicht zerst ren d rfen was wir aus ihr herausretten wollen
4433612 m nner sind irgendwie um mich aber es bedeutet wenig
4433613 du wirst dir ja denken k nnen dass die zeit seit dir f r mich nicht ohne beziehungen zu m nnern vergangen ist aber nichts ist zur bindung geworden
4433614 ich liebe dich und will dich nicht lieben es ist zuviel und zu schwer
4433615 lieber paul ich weiss dass du mich heute nicht mehr liebst
4433616 wir wissen genug voneinander um uns bewusst zu machen dass nur die freundschaft zwischen uns m glich bleibt das andere ist unrettbar verloren

4433623 you could say a game here is worth two elsewhere but it is more than that
4433624 i want to challenge myself both in matches and in training every day and i want to improve my game that is why i am here as long as the manager keeps me as part of the team that will do for me
4433625 despite 2007s wet summer this is the eighth year in succession that usage has risen and with around one in ten cyclists on the network being new or returning to cycling it shows that the uks appetite for healthy environmentally responsible travel is increasing
4433626 while theres already been a healthy increase in the number of people on bikes half of londoners who own a bike arent using them regularly and over a million londoners are still missing out on the benefits of cycling
4433627 i believe this partnership will create a step change for cycling cycling is already one of britains sporting success stories and this is a truly exciting opportunity to grow the sport even further sky is a committed and passionate partner for british cycling working together we can take elite cycling to new heights and get more people involved in the sport at all levels
4433628 over the past decade british cycling has seen unprecedented success in the international arena and more recently significant growth within the sport skys support presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform our sport by building on our international success and using it to get more people cycling more people engaged with the sport and more people belonging to british cycling

4433632 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4433633 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4433634 this result is just the first to be declared with positive ballot results expected over the next few days at stansted and manchester airports
4433635 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4433636 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4433637 el planeta ha cambiado y en lo econ mico el dominio estadounidense de hace 20 30 a os se ha desvanecido tenemos que hacernos a la idea de que nuestro pa s ya no es el l der del mundo occidental
4433638 aunque el siglo xx fuera el de los estados unidos no podremos decir lo mismo del siglo xxi
4433639 en realidad es muy f cil criticar a los estados unidos con esta administraci n tan p sima que hemos sufrido
4433640 puede que s admite es la tem tica de cada una de las pel culas la que marca la pauta aunque en ning n caso se pierde el estilo musical
4433641 una vez que aceptas un trabajo de encargo tienes que hacerlo nunca he sido bueno con el deber que me he autoimpuesto reconozco que soy algo vago e indisciplinado a la hora de componer para m por ello no me he centrado tanto en mis propios discos

4433643 the union engaged in unfair labor practices when they failed to notify us of this merger and they failed to prove the existence of seiu local 715 to us
4433644 all the national labor relations board said was that local 715 was supposed to have provided information to stanford proving the unions existence and we didnt
4433645 stanford as usual is taking something and completely distorting it its a cover to justify their 10 year pattern of anti union behavior
4433646 we wanted to provide a one stop fact based around the clock resource to help our employees make the right decision on voting day
4433647 stanford is wasting patient care dollars trying to fight the voices of caregivers at the workplace by trying to discourage them from voting for union representation
4433648 we expect the supreme court will be the final decision maker
4433649 in america we should value the labor of every person and reward it with a few basic guarantees such as fair wages and treatment healthcare and a dignified retirement
4433650 all workers should be free to form a union and if they choose to form a union management should negotiate in good faith to reach the first contract
4433651 the card check is no more accurate than the petition held by beef northwest saying the workers dont want representation
4433652 there have been ongoing discussions none of which have reached any point of consensus yet
4433653 democrats cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election we are the party that has always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
4433654 the misnamed employee free choice act also would have denied workers the right to a secret ballot on the question of whether they want to be represented by a union at all
4433655 the house has passed organized labors top legislative priority a measure that would make it far easier for workers to organize they could get a majority of workers to sign cards rather than having to win a contested election
4433656 the proposed law in most cases would dispense with elections and make the decision of whether to sign a union card the sole and very public determinant of organizing
4433657 efca strikes down a fundamental right of workplace democracy the secret ballot in representation elections
4433658 by eliminating the option of a secret ballot in union organizing votes a union would no longer have to win a secret ballot election to gain the right to represent workers should the employer refuse to certify that bargaining unit instead elections would be replaced by the card check system
4433659 this is perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4433660 nysut members are property taxpayers too and they too want relief but not at the expense of their schools and school children
4433661 political expediency over the future of new yorks children and public schools
4433662 but the teachers union is free to do what they want
4433663 we need more details on the specifics of a tax cap on growth of school taxes
4433664 legislators and the governor must take a comprehensive approach to school funding that reforms the property tax system maintains funding for classrooms and helps improve graduation rates
4433665 you will give a perverse incentive for the school district to spend more money
4433666 new york is no 1 in taxes and in some cases no 34 in test scores so something is backwards here
4433667 we may look back at this as a significant event and significant miscalculation on their part
4433668 this is a legislature that has been bending over backward for nysut for decades
4433669 do they really intend to declare war on 38 senators who odds are are going to be returned to the senate

4433675 pr cticamente la mayor a de las enfermedades respiratorias cr nicas pueden ser en mayor o menor grado causa de retardo del crecimiento

4433680 perhaps the biggest crisis the aviation industry has ever known
4433681 theyve put rings on each others fingers but we may have to wait for several years for the consummation
4433682 legislation is an open invitation to abuse and ought to be opposed by congressional democrats
4433683 during this tough economic time a yearly pay reduction of 250 to 500 for an unplanned unauthorized payroll deduction could spell disaster for many families
4433684 when hired as an employee of the las virgenes unified school district no employee was instructed it was mandatory to pay an agency fee to lvca
4433685 the issue has nothing to do with the administration or the board
4433686 im not going to back down i can tell you that
4433687 house prices have doubled in a matter of months restaurants are opening alongside the waterside corniche oil rich kuwaitis are beginning to move in and trade at the port is booming
4433688 i have participated in my share of vigorous public debates over issues of great consequence and the public has been free to accept or reject the decisions i made when they walked into a ballot booth drew the curtain and cast their vote i didnt always win but i always respected the process voting is an immense privilege that is why i am concerned about a new development that could deny this freedom to many americans
4433689 instead of a private election with a secret ballot overseen by an impartial federal board union organizers would simply need to gather signatures from more than 50 of the employees in a work place or bargaining unit
4433690 we cannot be a party that strips workers of the right to a secret ballot election we are the party that always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
4433691 and disrupt a tried and trusted method for conducting an honest election
4433692 will allow workers to form a union through majority sign up and card checks
4433693 members know that they have the option to be involved in political action or not
4433694 obviously general funds were used for the political action committee which violates the rights of the members to decide whether they wanted to participate in political activities are not
4433695 did not see approval of the additional expenses in the talb board minutes or representative council minutes
4433696 thats it how was it done i just dont have the particulars in front of me
4433697 they were held outside talb offices in secret places and we had no idea where they were
4433698 should not be secured with funds from the general fund as that restricts cash necessary for the payment of the ongoing operations of talb
4433699 there might have been problems with our procedures and some of the ways that we deal with our finances
4433700 but through the audit and through a lot of work we rectified a lot of those problems or virtually all of those problems
4433701 its the members money of course they have every right to know
4433702 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
4433703 a liberal is someone who puts his foot down firmly on thin air
4433704 america was built by its radicals the hope and future of america lies with its radicals
4433705 this is the job for todays radical to fan the embers of hopelessness into a flame to fight
4433706 from militant indians to chicanos to puerto ricans to blacks from all parts of the black power spectrum from panthers to radical philosophers from a variety of campus activists s d s and others to a priest who was joining a revolutionary party in south america
4433707 and their arrogance is the major threat to our future as a free society
4433708 the best education i ever had and where i learned the true meaning of my christian faith
4433709 camouflage is key to alinsky style organizing in organizing coalitions of black churches in chicago obama caught flak for not attending church himself he became an instant churchgoer
4433710 ethical standards must be elastic to stretch with the times
4433711 all values are relative in a world of political relativity
4433712 an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom lucifer
4433713 a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
4433714 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4433715 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4433716 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4433717 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4433718 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4433719 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt
4433720 the power and the people are in the big middle class majority
4433721 he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet he walks around in 520 italian loafers
4433722 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine
4433723 in key battleground states the retiree vote is going to be crucial in the presidential race
4433724 our research polling focus groups indicates that many seniors still are unaware of john mccains record in support of privatization and plans to drastically reduce benefits

4433751 travel is good recommends that networks of routes rather than single tracks and the provision of facilities such as toilets and shops within easy access of homes will all go towards increasing the use of sustainable forms of transport for short local journeys
4433752 unfortunately for the cyclists our ipsos mori survey of public perceptions of transport shows that facilities for pedestrians and cyclists came joint bottom in the list of priorities which people in general believe the government should spend its money on if it invests extra money on transport
4433753 it is highly commendable when large scale employers such as this take such a positive lead it is a win win situation because they are improving the health of their staff as well as reducing the impact on the environment
4433754 i would like to see all health employers positively ratcheting up their mileage rates
4433755 i started cycling in 1966 because there were no public transport links and i couldnt afford a car but i also enjoyed it as a method of keeping fit and healthy
4433756 in recent years the green aspect has become more important to me and i try to use the car as little as possible for business journeys
4433757 its a 23 mile round trip for me from home to work in all seasons there are great facilities provided here though with a bike shed and showers on site people should definitely consider cycling to work more often

4433764 i cant believe it said liukin who finished with 63
4433765 i worked so hard for so many years for this
4433766 i saw valeris gold medal every single day when i woke up that gave me a little extra motivation i think that made a little bit of difference just to be able to see it having it there in my room knowing that in a few months i could have one of my own
4433767 looking at the next day its all around finals liukin said of their evening on thursday
4433768 were just looking at each other like can you believe it tomorrows the day we just wanted to go all out and have fun
4433769 she deserved that gold medal shes one of my best friends and the usa was standing on top of the podium we just wanted the best for each other
4433770 i probably would have told you a month ago that i was done she said
4433771 but after being here and experiencing the olympics id give anything to feel that again if i can in 2012 ill be there

4433794 de winst van inbev groeide tijdens het tweede kwartaal weliswaar met 8 6 procent tot 808 miljoen dollar tegenover dezelfde periode vorig jaar maar die stijging was hoofdzakelijk afkomstig van een eenmalige belastingsverlaging

4433806 its encouraging that many people are considering changing their plans with regards to holidays this year although its still a concern that so many people are still spending beyond their means
4433807 the relatively easy access to credit in recent years has meant it is now common for people to get into debt to fund expensive holidays and this debt can become a serious burden if its not managed properly
4433808 we live in a culture where we can take many things for granted and it seems to many people that includes holidays but if that involves racking up large it might be best to carry on saving and maybe even wait until next year
4433809 sharing is a good way of minimising holiday debts this summer and some people may be able to avoid getting into debt entirely this way certainly if you are still intending on going on holiday we advise people to cut costs wherever possible unless you are completely sure you can afford it
4433810 the credit crunch is putting pressure on most of us at this time and there is the risk that unless you are very careful you could arrive home with potentially unmanageable debts to deal with
4433811 many people book holidays well in advance up to a year in some cases much of this is done on credit under the belief that they will be able to save up enough money in that time to cover the holiday
4433812 but the pressures of the credit crunch and rising costs of living mean that many people may be finding it much harder to pay for their holidays than they anticipated
4433813 we advise anyone in this situation to contact an expert debt adviser who can discuss your situation and help decide the best plan of action there are various debt solutions available to suit different situations including debt consolidation loans and ivas choosing the right debt solution could help you cut down your monthly costs and prevent your debts from continuing to grow

4433820 what stands out is the mediocrity of a group of technicians and developers who are well meaning but full of an anachronistic paternalism in the best of cases and are once more using gaud to leave their personal mark on the building to the detriment of the original work
4433821 what they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of gaud it has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes
4433822 this was a disaster because even though they had all the necessary documents regarding the material and techniques to be used they were not followed
4433823 the problem with restoring gaud s work is that by the time there was an awareness of his legacy he had been dead for 50 years

4433844 i believe strongly that if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem and he voted for the energy bill that had all kind of tax breaks and giveaways for the oil companies i believe if youre not part of the solution you are part of the problem and its a big problem in america today
4433845 in fact john mccain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation he has missed all eight votes over the last year which effectively counts as a no vote each time once he was even in the senate and wouldnt leave his office to vote
4433846 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
4433847 i think john mccain is going to make sure that america stays america
4433848 i am not sending any negative message in this campaign
4433849 this is why hes such a popular candidate in europe because theres such an anti american feeling there hes sort of capturing that
4433850 we dont want to talk about his obamas patriotism and character we concede that hes a patriot and a person of good character

4433876 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4433877 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4433878 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4433879 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4433886 hes strong and athletic and like his namesake has important experience at the top level we can call upon
4433887 cameronism is real as real as new labour or the third way and is likely to be the guiding light of the next government
4433888 cameronism is certainly not an ideology nor even yet a coherent political philosophy
4433889 cameronism displays a number of key features it emphasises the pragmatic over the theoretical takes an essentially optimistic view of human nature favours the devolution rather than the centralisation of power stresses social rather than economic progress and places more faith in society than the state
4433890 the best summary of cameronism cameron himself has yet articulated
4433891 we want to respond to what should be a new post bureaucratic age by decentralising power by giving people more opportunity and control over their lives by making families stronger and society more responsible
4433892 the level of political disorientation caused by cameronism is still difficult to cope with
4433893 there is more than a hint here in jon elsters phrase of cameron willing that which cannot be willed cameron wants to roll forward society but it is not yet clear how this can be achieved and doubtful it can be achieved unless the conservatives move to a more balanced view of the state
4433894 cameron verges on hypocrisy on the issue of state action he has set up a young adult trust which he says is working in partnership with many of britains leading youth organisations to develop plans for all 16 year olds that help teach them the responsibilities of adulthood
4433895 a national programme to teach adulthood if ed balls announced it the tories would be turning it into a piece of nanny state gone mad propaganda cameron is quite right that labour is very often guilty of knee jerk statism but he is equally at risk of unthinking anti statism
4433896 we treated him and tried to get him back for punchestown but it just wasnt happening hes had a really good holiday and he looks a million dollars hes moving better hes better than he ever was
4433897 last summer he didnt do as well as he has done this year hes come in 40 kilograms heavier
4433898 at the moment having spoken to owner alan potts were going to stick to hurdling our view is that hes the highest rated hurdler over two miles in england and ireland so wed like to have another go at the champion hurdle
4433899 at the moment bar if things didnt look great early in the season well stick to hurdling

4433918 feeling grateful or appreciative of someone or something in your life actually attracts more of the things that you appreciate and value into your life
4433919 develop an attitude of gratitude say think you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you
4433920 sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light
4433921 gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough and more it turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow
4433922 dont let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision
4433923 what is it that makes all of us end each day with the sense that we have not lived our time but have been lived used by what we do
4433924 why has time disappeared in our culture how is it that after decades of inventions and new technologies devoted to saving time and labor the result is that there is no time left we are a time poor society we are temporally impoverished and there is no issue no aspect of human life that exceeds this in importance the destruction of time is literally the destruction of life
4433925 with one mind we address our acknowledgement respect and gratefulness to all the sacred cycle of life we as humans must remember to be humble and acknowledge the gifts we use so freely in our daily lives

4433937 wfps initial emergency food response is well underway and will be sustained to ensure life saving food support is given to the displaced families many of whom are elderly women and young children

4433939 validation assessments to help determine a sustained and targeted response
4433940 in the current unpredictable security situation vulnerable victims of these clashes urgently need to receive humanitarian assistance especially essential food among other complimentary relief items
4433941 the important next step will be for wfp to conduct more in depth assessments together with relevant partners to better quantify the overall magnitude of the needs faced by the affected population and recommend additional support as necessary while food assistance is urgently needed in the current life saving relief phase it will also need to be sustained throughout the critical livelihood rehabilitation period
4433942 the milf said the signing of the moa is just a formality
4433943 what would be the effect of our ruling to the milf
4433944 can you cite a case where a person has been prohibited from exercising a legal right
4433945 the problem here is that there is no consummated act yet why cant you wait for the signing of the agreement
4433946 we dont want to get the impression that only anti moa people reside in mindanao
4433947 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
4433948 on matter of due process when petition is filed against the law provides that the other party should be given the right to be heard the government is like any other ordinary citizen who should be given the chance to be heard which is missing on this case
4433949 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
4433950 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4433951 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it
4433952 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4433953 i got the feeling they underestimated us as we were standing in the tunnel before the match
4433954 this was the greatest moment of my fcm career we fought like hell and ran and ran this win leaves us in a good position ahead of the second leg but we will have to remember that we are playing against a premier league team so nothing is decided yet
4433955 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4433956 in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and try to drive the play
4433957 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4433958 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4433959 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4433960 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4433961 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired

4433979 when the president was killed the national army and the rebels resumed the war
4433980 it was not easy to live with the war in the capital after two weeks we left kigali for my native province gitarama
4433981 there was no killing in my village but the life was useless because of many refugees around
4433982 the new rwandan army believed that there were people who had committed the genocide among the refugees
4433983 it was not possible to separate them from the innocent so they treated them as if they had all committed genocide
4433984 the responsibility is not established if they were killed by the rwanda army or by the congolese rebels
4433985 they give you your own land to start a new life

4434023 we are not immune to a recession nobody is but the hysterical approach to focus only on the luxury sector is dangerous because you need to develop the business in all areas and segments

4434028 they have been coddled in this market the iphone could be the trigger that forces them to make changes
4434029 our little joanne was one of the liveliest children in the street and was someone who was so full of beans she could not sit still for any moment of the day
4434030 every day was very important to her and she filled each minute of the day being busy at school window shopping which she adored especially as it did not require any money to do or outside playing with her friends
4434031 she was very definitely an outside child and never seemed to have time for indoor things such as computer games and tv watching
4434032 she loved going to school and left home early every morning to make sure she was there in time for the breakfast club and only left school when she had gone to the after school clubs she especially enjoyed sports at school and loved playing football
4434033 we were very touched when we received a card signed by the players of ipswich town football club
4434034 not a sad child joanne laughed and sang her way through the day
4434035 her care for the world around her was also shown in the way she loved and looked after her hamster and the family dog
4434036 she goes leaving a very large hole in our lives and her mum and dad her sisters sarah and louise will keep her memory alive forever
4434037 each of you has made our pain just a little bit lighter suffolk homes
4434038 todo fue creado en un estudio de rep blica dominicana
4434039 parece real porque est muy bien hecho la idea era aprovechar el contenido de la letra que trata sobre una persona que busca a su amada alrededor del mundo
4434040 siempre quise actuar en jap n y esta gira me dar la oportunidad de hacerlo
4434041 ser un sue o hecho realidad estoy seguro de que la recepci n a nuestra m sica por all va a ser muy buena
4434042 hace poco vi turandot pera de giacomo puccini y me llam much simo la atenci n
4434043 normalmente lo que digo en mis temas le corresponde a la realidad que se vive en mi pa s
4434044 esto sucede sobre todo cuando hago piezas sociales como ojal que llueva caf que es una frase de un poema que rescat para hacerla canci n as como el ni gara en bicicleta y visa para un sue o donde se habla de problemas que se dan en rep blica dominicana
4434045 tabar blanchard el muchacho que me hizo el video dice que mis canciones son muy descriptivas y eso le conviene mucho cuando tiene que pensar en las im genes
4434046 pero yo las hago as porque es lo que llevo en el coraz n
4434047 empiezo con la m sica hago los arreglos y termino con las letras
4434048 es algo que tengo adentro y que necesita salir no me pongo realmente a pensar por adelantado qu voy a decir o qu no voy a decir en una canci n
4434049 claro que me gusta mucho la poes a de federico garc a lorca pablo neruda y c sar vallejo as como lo que hicieron los grandes m sicos y los grandes pintores como claude monet y pablo picasso
4434050 ten a la intenci n de hacer algo social porque me gusta mucho esa tem tica pero las melod as de estas canciones no me llevaban por ese lado
4434051 uno no puede darle la contra a la inspiraci n pero eso no quiere decir que no vaya a hacer m s adelante otras canciones sociales
4434052 visa para un sue o y el ni gara en bicicleta tambi n son bailables
4434053 del mismo modo una canci n rom ntica puede tener un ritmo lento o r pido dependiendo de la intenci n que quieras darle
4434054 el amor tiene innumerables versiones y el que nos da dios se manifiesta tambi n en este trabajo aunque se muestre de manera indirecta a trav s de la relaci n de pareja
4434055 muchas de las letras en el lbum se inspiraron todav a en lo que se encuentra dentro de la biblia

4434058 me interesaba que el tema principal con el que se iba a promover el disco no se pareciera a nada de lo que hab a hecho antes
4434059 me gusta salir siempre con cosas nuevas esa es una de las t cticas de este negocio si es que se puede decir que hay t cticas en l creo que la llave de mi coraz n es en realidad una especie de mambo blues con toques de merengue
4434060 fue hecha con una guitarra ac stica y qued as
4434061 no creo realmente que tenga influencia de la trova me parece m s bien que va por el lado del pop rock de los beatles
4434062 nada de eso me afecta soy un vanguardista y me encuentro abocado a hacer cosas nuevas
4434063 por supuesto respeto mucho las formas tradicionales pero si estoy aqu es para hacer evolucionar la m sica dominicana me encantan las fusiones y eso es algo que he tenido en mente desde el inicio de mi carrera
4434064 we can do no great things only small things with great love

4434068 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
4434069 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
4434070 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
4434071 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
4434072 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by at st louis we have senator obama on board the aircraft and his campaign
4434073 the moons shadow also a signal blind area could cause a power shortage in freezing temperatures

4434077 what has gone up very high in a straight line will also come down
4434078 there are some projects launched at 2 200 per square foot psf that went up to 3 400 3 500psf today there are some people who are so frightened they would sell at 1 700psf
4434079 you pick up when some people want to commit suicide pick up cheap keep it rent it stay
4434080 its a question of how much profit you want to make its a question of when we want to recognise the profit
4434081 i can book in 30 per cent instead of 20 per cent launching at the right time will give you maximum profit
4434082 we have different ways of raising money including issuing convertible bonds
4434083 the hotel segment has slowed but its not so material you wont fall off the cliff

4434087 although the board were unable to state categorically that the fatal wounds were fired from an armoured support company viking the weight of evidence suggests it is possible that this was a blue on blue friendly fire incident
4434088 after looking at everything it looks like i had been there and just dont remember
4434089 epic is excited to work with ea partners to launch our next big ip on the global stage
4434090 ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs
4434091 grasshopper manufacture is excited to work with ea partners to bring our new title to gamers around the world
4434092 they are a great partner who shares our commitment to quality and innovation while respecting our independence as a studio which is very empowering
4434093 i think they look at gears of war and halo and wonder why they cant do that ea has to do something about that
4434094 they have tried on and off over the years its just like activision had to come out from doing hardcore games and do more for the masses
4434095 we are seeing a shift even in hardcore games to snackable gaming
4434096 call of duty 4 had a shorter single player campaign and really good multiplayer gamers are driven by getting achievements finishing games and they want to consume a lot of games
4434097 people do play with the wii like crazy for a while it gathers cobwebs then they bring it out again
4434098 but kids are such a big part of the gaming community now and theyre demanding wiis from their parents those kids will shape the future of gaming and theyre not a fad
4434099 they would absolutely have to be at the end of their tether to call the police a lot of parents dont even know they can call the police with these kinds of issues its absolutely the last step
4434100 parents are trying to compensate for not being available they are generally wanting to give their kids the best then the kids just start to use quite bullying tactics and slowly over time they will start to up the ante until they are smashing things and becoming quite abusive
4434101 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4434102 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4434103 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4434104 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4434105 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4434106 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4434107 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4434108 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4434109 id like to play in the first one i think its still a possibility but i havent run yet

4434111 its one of those things ive been used to for a long time now playing off the bench
4434112 ive been ready for test football for the last eight weeks so if the opportunity was going to come up earlier on i wouldve been ready and im ready this week
4434113 everyone suffers their fair share of injuries ive not been excluded from that but its one of those things and he burgess will be back at some stage
4434114 the opportunity is there for myself to press for another start
4434115 we had a job to do and we did it well
4434116 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4434117 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again

4434120 im almost sure i cant wait to do it again
4434121 gold remains a safe haven but its attribute as a commodity links it to the trend of other commodities
4434122 the speculative allure gold had presented to index and hedge funds has all but dissipated
4434123 clearly beyond the scope of their fundamentals and reached distorted levels
4434124 many were well aware that when the oil surge would come to a halt or reverse course that it would carry with it part or all of the group
4434125 this in fact has happened however it unfolded a lot quicker than conventional wisdom expected
4434126 the events of a few days or even a few months do not necessarily undo what is so far an event that has been going on for seven years
4434127 a bull market can stand a correction of 30 in the price from time to time and still remain intact
4434128 they are all undergoing shifts of an order of magnitude that we have not seen for half a decade
4434129 no wonder that investment postures and asset reallocation are also undergoing a significant transformation
4434130 strong advocate of a core insurance position in gold bullion trouble it seems is always but one headline away from undoing the best laid plans
4434131 this collapse in gold has caught the gold bugs wholly off guard

4434137 kasusnya baru kami ketahui pada masa registrasi ini sehingga surat pertanyaan kepada pimpinan pusat pdk sedang diproses saat ini

4434186 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4434187 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well

4434199 our proposed activities with basic element falls into two categories of activities
4434200 mining activities in particular in mongolia and eastern siberia and activities outside those regions
4434201 mongolia does have significant mineral deposits and its a question of how they develop those
4434202 we have exchanged correspondence with basic element and we are waiting for the next step
4434203 its works in progress we have a very strong and friendly relationship with the basic element group
4434204 were seriously looking at mongolia as an area of opportunity
4434205 weve also been in engaged in discussions with the basic elements group in russia oleg deripaska to look at mining opportunities in siberia
4434206 the people who deal with release dates are not film makers theyre worried about the bottom line
4434207 and the bottom line is they could do with a big film next year more than in november
4434208 i dont think theres a great overlap in the audiences for bond and potter
4434209 theyre different films aimed at different markets so i dont see them as competitors or rivals
4434210 you want to put your biggest releases on as many screens as possible
4434211 if there is a scenario where screens are being hogged by a film that is lingering around why not wait
4434212 i dont think theyre trying to eke out the cash cow longer
4434213 eight months wont make much difference overall in terms of the harry potter franchise

4434224 probablemente los dem s equipos quieran conseguir ante nosotros cosas que croacia no pudo no creo que podamos dejarlos en 53 puntos como hicimos ayer pero nuestra idea es mantener esa intensidad
4434225 hoy en d a en el deporte moderno cualquiera que est bien preparado y juegue bien al b squetbol puede darte un susto en cualquier noche
4434226 hicimos un gran partido esper bamos jugar as muy duro uno nunca espera sacar tanta diferencia en un choque de estas caracter sticas ante un rival como croacia que tambi n se jugaba much simo como nosotros
4434227 a nosotros no salieron todas bien y a ellos ninguna

4434232 hungary takes stand in uproar over russian invasion of georgia
4434233 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4434234 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4434235 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4434236 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4434237 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4434238 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4434239 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4434240 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4434241 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4434242 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4434243 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4434244 bitch drink the rest of that you know we dont waste
4434245 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4434246 in my short four months with the company i continue to be irritated and disappointed in the many issues that i continue to uncover and need to be addressed the elephant in the room today is q3 of 2008 we posted record revenues yet we lost money how can that be april and may combined for aloss of 637 000 had june continued as in past trends we would have ended up losing 750 000 in the quarter however we began an aggressive sales strategy in may in the atv accessories segment to capture orders that were at risk and took market segment away from our competitors as a result june revenue was over 1 7 million higher than any other previous june what is particularly frustrating is that the effect of this record revenue was diminished by increased raw material costs and sg amp a although the company implemented a significant price increase of its own we were not able to pass on the full price increase to distributors and customers in order to remain competitive
4434247 i am embarrassed by the pitiful performance of the weekend warrior segment if it can be called a segment less than 13 000 for the quarter is disgraceful there had been virtually no sales efforts in this segment for most of the year prior to my arrival and we are experiencing the consequences i still believe that this will be a successful market segment but i dont realistically expect to see any real revenue growth in this segment until q1 of 2009
4434248 another disappointing segment is the plastic wheel covers division at a time when revenue for this segment should be increasing it is decreasing the reason is the past lack of effective marketing and customer service which resulted in unhappy customers that are former customers we are now doing a better job of selling the capabilities to current and new customers
4434249 we are re establishing and strengthening relations with new and existing oems we are doing that and our revenue through oems is increasing inventory levels have rarely been higher than they were at the end of q3 the sales efforts of q3 are beginning to reduce that but it is not fast enough we have and will increase our efforts in that area
4434250 to avoid another disgraceful and embarrassing quarter we obviously have to increase sales and reduce costs we have worked with our steel suppliers and have locked in our steel costs for the remainder of the calendar year we are working with an outside consultant to analyze our product flow throughout manufacturing they will make recommendations to increase efficiency we are also reviewing all salaried positions to determine where we can reduce personnel costs
4434251 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4434252 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4434253 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4434254 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4434255 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4434256 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4434257 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4434259 sua avers o religi o no sentido que o termo normalmente tem era o mesmo tipo daquele de lucr cio ele a via com a sensa o de que era n o uma mera fraude mental mas um grande mal moral ele a via como o maior inimigo da moralidade primeiramente por estabelecer padr es artificiais cren a em credos sentimentos devocionais e cerim nias n o ligados ao bom do homem e determinar que estes fossem aceitos como substitutos para a verdadeira virtude mas acima de tudo por viciar de forma radical o padr o moral isso consiste em fazer as vontades de um ser com o qual esbanja todas as frases de louvor mas que na verdade relata como sendo eminentemente odioso
4434260 e ser que sobrevindo te todas estas coisas a b n o ou a maldi o que tenho posto diante de ti e te recordares delas entre todas as na es para onde te lan ar o senhor teu deus e te converteres ao senhor teu deus e deres ouvidos sua voz conforme a tudo o que eu te ordeno hoje tu e teus filhos com todo o teu cora o e com toda a tua alma

4434262 everton are putting big money forward as they are backed by the football club
4434263 they are trying to move up after finishing just above us i think they will be going for the championship
4434264 its going to be a lot stronger across the board which is good for basketball and the bbl
4434265 we have three or four new men to come in and we are also looking for some bench players
4434266 we are looking for certain players and we have to get them to gel together
4434267 this year we have players coming in from france australia and the usa you never really know until they get here how they are going to play together
4434268 southwest achieved two key goals in our efforts to stabilize and grow our business platform during the second quarter
4434269 first after a tremendous amount of hard work running aces harness park a 62 million racetrack and card room in minnesota opened on time and on budget and is now fully operational on april 11th we began harness racing a change in state law allowed us to expand into all breed simulcast wagering in early may and most importantly we opened the 50 table card room at running aces on schedule on the evening of june 30th after completing 50 days of live harness racing second the consulting services we have provided to palace resorts for the past 10 months led to an expansion of that relationship into a long term agreement to manage the casino we are helping them develop in the dominican republic our colorado casinos continue to outperform a market that is down we may be beginning to see the impact of the soft economy at all of our facilities as well as the effects of the smoking ban in our colorado casinos that began this year we anticipated the losses at running aces which were primarily due to pre opening expenses including hiring and training more than 500 employees and the cost of completing the first live race meet before we were permitted to open the card room as always we continue to explore opportunities that will enhance and expand southwest and increase shareholder value
4434270 i believe that our third quarter results demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model
4434271 we remain focused on executing against our business plan and controlling our costs and will continue to do so
4434272 we remain committed to tight fiscal governance as our revenues continue to grow
4434273 we are controlling our costs while turning around orders in shortened delivery times we expect to build our business base and increase sales without expanding operating costs we want to cross the profitability barrier as quickly as possible
4434274 we intend to keep building on our strong customer relationships which are yielding repeat orders as we aggressively pursue new account growth

4434295 se eles nos vencerem abrem 11 pontos na frente e praticamente eliminam um candidato ao t tulo outra partida importante seria uma decis o para nossa equipe
4434296 era uma equipe que para muitos iria brigar para n o cair j que veio de um acesso por m o grupo mostrou que tem for a e fez um excelente trabalho agora continuar trabalhando forte para permanecer entre os primeiros

4434310 their policies are all about politics the government is out of step with the hopes and dreams of americans the party is at its nadir the president has had nixon numbers for three years we cant go on being the all male gated community party we now know who our twenty seven percent is parties that oppose immigration end up on the dust heap of politics
4434311 they want to get obamas negatives up but the country doesnt want to hear it
4434312 if we run that kind of campaign obama could win by a landslide
4434313 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
4434314 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4434315 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4434316 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4434317 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4434318 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4434319 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4434320 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4434321 congress got a glimpse into how chemicals are regulated in this country and saw how broken the system is
4434322 the phthalate ban is only the tip of the iceberg of whats needed to protect americans from unsafe chemical exposures
4434323 public health advocates and parents were up against big oil and the chemical industry and we won this should serve as a wake up call to industry chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects have no place in consumer products
4434324 consumers are saying that the products we buy must be safe period the phthalate ban is a great start and an indication that congress is ready to consider the kind of sweeping chemical policy reform that is needed
4434325 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4434326 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4434327 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4434328 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4434329 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4434330 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4434331 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4434332 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4434333 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4434334 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4434335 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4434336 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4434337 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4434338 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4434339 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4434340 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4434341 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4434342 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4434343 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4434344 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4434345 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4434346 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease

4434417 for too long creating a film or visual message has been shrouded in mystery and has been beyond the reach of most people the reality is that with our software anyone can create a film in their lunch break using our quick start movie process moviestorm also provides experienced film makers with a comprehensive movie making tool to help them translate their visions to a screen easily and cost effectively
4434418 we built moviestorm to bring personal movie making to the world and this release is a huge step forward with nothing but moviestorm and your imagination anyone can make a movie put it online and experience the sheer pleasure of being a movie maker moviestorm proves what weve always believed given the right tools at the right price more people will make movies than you imagine

4434420 there has been a curiosity factor about jade goody ever since her rivalry with shilpa shetty in uk last year and we thought she would make a good participant
4434421 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4434422 this survey could give some hints if us consumers are able to drag the economy out of the mud
4434423 they will eventually start cutting rates from the early part of next year and that will be a key factor which will contribute to more euro weakness
4434424 we probably have seen the top of the euro at 1 60
4434425 were not convinced that we will see any interest rate hikes in the us this year which will ultimately disappoint the markets
4434426 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4434427 we will not give up bank secrecy but we are willing to collaborate with other nations when it comes to the misuse of bank secrecy laws for tax evasion
4434428 eliminate any abetment problems in violation of the eea european economic area

4434433 we are very pleased that the west virginia state police is so satisfied with the performance of our dvm 500 in car video rearview mirror systems that the agency has placed its largest order to date with our company
4434434 while the cumulative total of 516 units ordered by the west virginia state police represents the largest number of dvm 500 systems ordered by a single law enforcement agency in the united states the number of our customers that have placed multiple follow on orders after gaining field experience with their initial dvm 500s continues to expand
4434435 while this order from an international customer totals only 25 units it illustrates that law enforcement agencies are moving beyond the testing phase and into the deployment of the dvf 500 within their organizations
4434436 we have always expected that broad acceptance of the dvf 500 digital video flashlight would take more time than was the case with our dvm 500 in car video systems because we are defining and serving a market that did not exist prior to the introduction of our product on the other hand the dvf 500 provides law enforcement officers with much greater flexibility in the documentation of criminal activities regardless of their location and we believe the long range market potential for digital video flashlights will be substantial

4434438 our second quarter financial results reflect difficult macroeconomic conditions and a significant slowdown in consumer spending however we see these challenging times as a great opportunity to place more distance between us and the rest of specialty retail we remain firmly committed to the aspirational positioning of our brands and to building the foundation that supports us as a truly multinational business we will continue to focus on what we do best providing the best casual lifestyle brands for our customers by continuously elevating the quality of our product and the emotional store experience we believe this gives us a competitive advantage and is critical to our long term success

4434441 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings
4434442 as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level
4434443 understandably this is a high profile case and at this stage we are unable to comment further
4434444 he has trained all week we took him down to the community shield last sunday and he did some work for us then
4434445 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4434446 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4434447 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4434448 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4434449 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4434450 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4434451 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer

4434454 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4434455 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4434456 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4434457 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4434458 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy

4434462 my whole vision of this has always been about creating community and creating a place where we can not only be free but also the kind of community where youre really connected with the people there and feel comfortable and happy in your environment
4434463 im glad that you can forgive only hoping as time goes you can forget
4434464 for the people by the people and from the people
4434465 vegetarian but eating fish which is a bit inconsequent imo but who cares
4434466 its encouraging that many people are considering changing their plans with regards to holidays this year although its still a concern that so many people are still spending beyond their means
4434467 the relatively easy access to credit in recent years has meant it is now common for people to get into debt to fund expensive holidays and this debt can become a serious burden if its not managed properly
4434468 we live in a culture where we can take many things for granted and it seems to many people that includes holidays but if that involves racking up large it might be best to carry on saving and maybe even wait until next year
4434469 sharing is a good way of minimising holiday debts this summer and some people may be able to avoid getting into debt entirely this way certainly if you are still intending on going on holiday we advise people to cut costs wherever possible unless you are completely sure you can afford it
4434470 the credit crunch is putting pressure on most of us at this time and there is the risk that unless you are very careful you could arrive home with potentially unmanageable debts to deal with
4434471 many people book holidays well in advance up to a year in some cases much of this is done on credit under the belief that they will be able to save up enough money in that time to cover the holiday
4434472 but the pressures of the credit crunch and rising costs of living mean that many people may be finding it much harder to pay for their holidays than they anticipated
4434473 we advise anyone in this situation to contact an expert debt adviser who can discuss your situation and help decide the best plan of action there are various debt solutions available to suit different situations including debt consolidation loans and ivas choosing the right debt solution could help you cut down your monthly costs and prevent your debts from continuing to grow
4434474 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4434475 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4434476 there is a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4434477 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4434478 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4434479 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4434480 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4434481 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4434482 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4434483 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there
4434484 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4434485 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4434486 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4434487 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4434488 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4434489 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time
4434490 i look forward to going to poland to sign that agreement soon
4434491 its important for the peace and security of the region its important for peace and security internationally
4434492 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4434493 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
4434494 they want to paralyze the country as long as they can
4434495 they are putting everything in a nonusable condition and taking what they want
4434496 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4434497 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4434498 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4434499 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4434500 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4434501 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4434502 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4434503 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4434504 thats just the thing it was written so people could understand they dont want any of that complex stuff
4434505 someone supporting me that is them accepting my positions my viewpoint not me adopting theirs
4434506 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4434507 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4434508 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4434509 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4434510 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4434511 a great milestone in the history of the two countries
4434512 we are saddled with the painful but most important task of handing over bakassi to cameroon we have commitments to the international community to promote peace and brotherliness between our countries
4434513 it is believed that if african leaders observe the rule of law the continent will be a more peaceful place
4434514 historic moment showing brotherly celebration of cooperation between the two countries
4434515 we in the un are happy about the handover what is important is that the handover is done at last
4434516 it has helped to douse tension generated by the ceremony
4434517 it is a wise decision and i think there must be good reason for it
4434518 after the handing over there will be buses and escort to convey you to the new bakassi for you to conduct interview
4434519 a good number of the senators were there at the national assembly when former president obasanjo and his cameroonian counter part were negotiating this issue why did they not shout only for this injunctive order to be issued at the wee hours of the day why didnt they tell the whole world their position then a good number of them were busy looking for a return to the national assembly
4434520 this agreement which puts syrian lebanese relations back on track is an important historical step
4434521 are positive steps aimed at strengthening relations in the interests of both countries

4434534 just a few minutes ago they russians entered poti in tanks
4434535 some of the guys have blue signs badges which means they should be peacekeepers
4434536 yesterday they came to the commercial port but today they only came to the military port to the coast guard area
4434537 people are afraid to go in there it might be mined
4434538 there are no russian armour or troops in the city of poti now
4434539 i think what they did was blow them up with some explosives
4434540 while the death of lcpl ford was a tragic incident the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the uks armed forces
4434541 i think you can expect to see us gold medal competitive in about eight events which is phenomenal
4434542 and because of the previous performances at the world championships we are odds on favourite and whichever way you look at it you cant avoid that
4434543 we know there is a very strong link between under age drinking and anti social behaviour
4434544 we are doing everything within our power to prevent people under 18 from buying alcohol in wrexham

4434573 weve all been looking to the federal government to step in and do something about all of these foreclosures and theyve done nothing
4434574 so we decided wed do it on the state level and if nothing else help the people of north carolina
4434575 once something gets in full foreclosure mode we can be pretty much assured that all of the possibilities of trying to keep this home from being sold from under these families will have been exhausted
4434576 this is not the state taking money to try to pay mortgages off for people this is not the state trying to subsidize banks

4434621 ik heb daar niet lang over na hoeven te denken
4434622 ik selecteer namelijk de beste voetballers en mark hoort daar in mijn ogen bij
4434623 mark is groot en sterk en kan goed voetballen hij is denk ik niet voor niets de eerste buitenlandse aanvoerder van bayern m nchen
4434624 hij moet zich nog wel een beetje beter leren beheersen
4434625 sneijder is nu geblesseerd maar rafael van der vaart robin van persie en ibrahim afellay kunnen ook goed achter de spits spelen dat wil niet zeggen dat ik seedorf al heb afgeschreven als het niet loopt met de huidige spelers kom ik misschien wel weer bij hem uit

4434629 we are looking forward to brandon making a full recovery and expect him to be ready for the start of the regular season
4434630 my round was well managed and i think that if you had to pinpoint something it was distance control so when i was uncomfortable with a certain hole location and there are going to be some of those on this course i was able to just hit the ball in the middle of the green and then give myself an easy two putt
4434631 it was one of those rounds that when i had to a hole six eight 10 footer for par i did

4434634 the idea is to let them assimilate without all the chaos
4434635 starting high school is an overwhelming situation and for the freshmen coming through the doors it can be intimidating we began the delayed opening several years ago so that the students coming through the door for the first time can have some time to themselves to get their bearings its worked out well in past years and were glad to be able to continue doing it i feel it really does help alleviate a lot of anxiety and confusion and its a great way to help make the students more comfortable
4434636 it can be difficult for these students to go from being the oldest and wisest pupils in their school to being the youngest and newest
4434637 so weve found that by delaying the rest of the students a few hours makes a big difference in how the incoming freshmen assimilate themselves

4434646 its all going to boil down to who can handle the pressure and who is tough enough

4434664 as multinational companies address rising health care costs todays emerging trend is to take a global approach to employee health
4434665 but before a company embarks on this approach it needs to think critically identifying and evaluating the specific issues that will affect outcomes such as cultural and language differences insight international is a tool that allows employers to pinpoint these issues

4434682 you know it was a long time ago lets not go there now because it would be a lot of b s
4434683 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4434684 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4434685 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4434688 you can be perfectly patriotic without wanting to swear allegiance to not just one person its not just the queen its her heirs and successors whoever they may be
4434689 the queen is a profoundly unifying force no matter what your background what your heritage where your grandparents came from we can all unite with her as our personal head of state
4434690 not content with trying to run public policy and things that should be left to the elected government here we have an example of human rights lawyers wanting to usurp the queen
4434691 what i was talking about was the rule of law and the importance of the rule of law and that means nobody is above the law
4434692 some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch

4434714 at best these petition gatherers were uninformed at worst they were careless and misleading
4434715 regardless their actions are unacceptable and do not serve the best interests of the electorate
4434716 so what would this do to the 391 percent apr
4434717 this is going to regulate it to a 5 percent rate give the people 30 days to pay back instead of the 7 to 14 days
4434718 just like some of the people who reached out for some of these loans the people who are gathering some of these signatures are also desperate for their one dollar
4434719 what i saw was a general aura of confusion that had been created for these petitioners i assume by the payday lending industry
4434720 and these petitioners were passing on their confusion to me and to other voters
4434721 if anyone has any actual evidence that something was said incorrectly we ask that the circulators name be obtained and we will take swift action to investigate and remove the employee if necessary

4434724 the citys had to halt their progress id like ross county water inc to halt work until this is decided
4434725 it makes it impossible for us to tap that line for a service connection for a line for a customer
4434726 theres probably going to be a countersuit to get ross county water out of the area
4434727 so if they have to shut off the water theyll be liable for an unlawful shutoff as long as they know that
4434728 carver provides many services to those in need in our community and we are honored to support carver in their efforts
4434729 we thank the many individuals and businesses who have already made donations to this effort and it is especially noteworthy to receive a large contribution like the one from huntington
4434730 we are hoping and praying that many others will contribute so that carver can continue its important role of service to the community for many years to come
4434731 the current building was constructed in 1973 and after 35 years the building has developed many maintenance problems
4434732 the roof by far is the most serious if we dont replace the roof soon the leaks will continue to cause damage to the interior of the building the longer that happens the higher the ultimate costs of repairs
4434733 obviously the american mer rovers spirit and opportunity that were put up by nasa enjoyed an extreme amount of success they were able to travel large distances well beyond their planned lifetimes but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
4434734 its quite a tense period for us in astrium and for the other companies involved in building exomars and for all the many many scientists who will depend on this mission
4434735 on the one hand we are moving ahead with a great momentum as youve seen this is not a paper project there is real engineering going on and we are on the verge of building the real hardware that will go on to the planet mars
4434736 but on the other hand we do have a real problem in order to complete the project further funding needs to be made available and it wont be until november that we are sure that that is in place
4434737 the uk will be working with its international partners to try to bring about a mission that has high impact and is affordable in a process of negotiation that will culminate in decisions at the ministerial in november 2008

4434745 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested

4434750 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
4434751 why dont you shut up in your statement on monday regarding the legitimate actions of the russian federation in georgia you failed to mention the war crimes perpetrated by georgian military forces which american advisors support against russian and ossetian civilians
4434752 why dont you shut up your faithful ally mikhail saakashvili was announcing a ceasefire deal while his troops with your advisors were massing on ossetias border which they crossed under cover of night and destroyed tskhinvali targeting civilian structures just like your forces did in iraq
4434753 why dont you shut up your american transport aircraft gave a ride home to thousands of georgian soldiers from iraq directly into the combat zone
4434754 do you really believe you have the right to give any opinion or advice after abu ghraib after guantanamo after the massacre of hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens after the torture by cia operatives
4434755 do you really believe you have any right to make a statement on any point of international law after your trumped up charges against iraq and the subsequent criminal invasion
4434756 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green

4434761 fiscal irresponsibility and deficit spending is a matter of national security because it undermines the viability of our economy
4434762 lets say youre somebody whos a working person in this country trying to make a living trying to put your kids through school and you look at the people from both parties and on the key issue you really dont see a difference this is where the
4434763 there are certainly a lot of them who are voting with the white house certainly more than speaker pelosi would like
4434764 would certainly rather have a blue dog in congress than lose that seat to republicans
4434765 our common battle cry is balance the budget and pay down the deficit
4434766 we have to debate it on every single issue debating certainly cuts down on wasteful spending
4434767 this congress has an opportunity to change the fiscal direction of our country
4434768 theres no doubt there will be tough choices to make as we live within this budget but americans are not afforded the luxury of living beyond their means and our government should stop doing so at the expense of our children and grandchildren
4434769 we simply cannot continue to mortgage our nations future and pass on trillions in debt to our grandchildren
4434770 fiscal irresponsibility and deficit spending is a matter of national security emphasis by author because it undermines the viability of our economy

4434774 the members of this board take their responsibilities very seriously we are dedicated to the matters of this board
4434775 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4434776 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4434777 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4434778 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4434779 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4434780 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4434781 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4434782 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4434783 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4434784 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4434785 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4434786 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4434787 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4434788 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4434789 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4434790 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4434791 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4434792 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4434793 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4434794 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4434795 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4434796 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4434797 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4434798 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4434799 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4434800 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4434801 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4434802 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4434803 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4434804 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4434805 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4434806 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4434807 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4434808 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4434809 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4434810 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4434811 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4434812 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4434813 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4434814 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4434815 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4434816 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4434817 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4434818 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4434819 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4434820 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4434821 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4434822 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4434823 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4434824 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4434825 they havent been that helpful theyre not misleading us but they didnt witness enough of what happened

4434827 the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world
4434828 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice

4434836 i realized that these were reflections of the fire in the eyes of the sheep in the midst of danger the sheep were not looking out into the darkness but were keeping their eyes set toward the shepherd
4434837 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
4434838 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
4434839 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
4434840 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
4434841 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
4434842 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
4434843 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
4434844 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
4434845 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
4434846 she was playing she knew what they were doing on the other side of that mirror
4434847 she was taking the control back instead of being the victim she wasnt being slutty she was being confident and sexual that was one of my favorite scenes it was one of the best revealing moments for joan and i also just love the dynamic of men and women on either side of that glass that i think it sums up a lot about mad men in particular what goes on in the office
4434848 i came to a point where i was willing to die
4434849 i just took my shoes off and my shirt off and jumped in
4434850 i just happened to come up and there was mr johnson
4434851 i saw him diving in my next breath i looked up and saw him touching my kayak i said i cant die and ruin his day i was worried about him then dakota showed up i think theyre two heroes i couldnt believe how fast everything was happening
4434852 they were soaking wet and they were out of breath because theyre both out of shape as young as they are
4434853 they did a selfless act and they did it without hesitation you cant tell them no no no and not reward them for the positive things
4434854 it feels really good doing something good to help someone
4434855 traditionally copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money
4434856 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration however
4434857 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4434858 the fate of yahoo is not going to change by any addition of these board members

4434860 its hard enough to contain a species once it makes its way into nonnative waters
4434861 when each mud snail has the ability to produce large quantities of embryos without a partner youve really got a problem
4434862 where theyve gotten into streams in the western part of the country theyve caused a lot of problems
4434863 theyre taking over space that should have other native species living in it
4434864 i could sum it up in one word nothing the permit doesnt change a thing
4434865 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4434866 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4434867 there may be better sprinters in the world but i doubt it there may be better sportsmen in the world but i doubt it
4434868 he was far and away the greatest competitor i ever encountered
4434869 if you were ahead of him you had to worry every second wondering about how fast he was catching up with you and if you were behind him you lost
4434870 the level crossing is crossed by hundreds of thousands of motorists every day and theres not one single collision involving a train on impact sgt exton told the committal hearing for scholl
4434871 i saw the train and saw there was nowhere to go in front so i tried to swing to the left so i wouldnt hit the train he said
4434872 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4434873 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4434874 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4434875 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4434876 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4434877 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4434878 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4434879 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4434880 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4434881 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4434882 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4434883 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4434884 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4434885 hes thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range
4434886 but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back
4434887 the problem is that the volume of tenants has risen by 25 but the volume of property available for rent has risen by 35 there is a lot of stock coming in from people who cant sell and who are putting it on the rental market instead there is a lot of choice out there for tenants
4434888 across the uk we are seeing a lot of people choosing to rent rather than buy and our offices are very busy but there has also been a surge in stock and i would say in some areas rental prices have fallen by 10 in docklands in particular we are seeing an oversupply developers have decided not to sell and are putting properties through the lettings market
4434889 recent buy to let investors may find themselves facing a 90 capital loss if they borrowed 90 of their property value
4434890 property investors may be forced to sell up prematurely because interest payments become unaffordable the real test of affordability is to come in 2009 10 when those who borrowed large sums at relatively cheap rates in 2007 come off two and three year fixed deals
4434891 weve seen flats with no kitchens and not even enough space for a packet of breakfast cereal they assume you only need a microwave and a freezer lots had no storage space for clothes and there was one where the second bedroom was separated from the rest of the flat by a curtain some have been overpriced by as much as 500 a month because thats what they need to pay the mortgage

4434895 as soon as i saw him i knew he was in a serious condition i shouted out to the officers and they then called the emergency services he was in a very bad way
4434896 we have launched an investigation after a man in his early to mid 40s died after being taken into hospital from coleraine police station it is very early stages in our investigation
4434897 cases such as these are automatically referred to us by the police
4434898 i am finding it difficult to understand how this went undetected for so long this was a member of the public in a very small part of a police station was nobody keeping an eye on him or wondering where he was
4434899 manchester city officials have been advised that the player would not be for sale and we are very disappointed they have continued their interest
4434900 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4434901 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4434902 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play
4434903 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players
4434904 if the team dont play well the strikers dont get the chances
4434905 they played a lot of long balls and did really well in the air winning a lot of the second balls we were all very disappointed by the performance we gave as players and as a team we tried to do our best and it was not good enough
4434906 over the years weve struggled in these qualifiers which is not what you would want and we would certainly take it if we can get through now and go on to do what weve done in the champions league in the past
4434907 hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4434908 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4434909 i saw a head in the water bobbing up and down i didnt really know what to do i just started running
4434910 i ran up the embankment and pulled out the first life ring but there was no way i could get it to him he was too far out i kept running and another guy joined me
4434911 i began to panic as i was running down as i couldnt see him any more people on the bank were pointing down that he was right under me
4434912 i got down on my stomach and looked under and he was holding onto a rope it was the last bit of energy he had he looked like he was ready to let go any minute i managed to get his arm and pulled him half over he was a big fellow and was soaking wet and i got him halfway up onto the jetty
4434913 the other boy arrived just in time to help me pull the guy onto the jetty we put him into the recovery position and waited for the ambulance to come he was conscious but couldnt speak
4434914 its not something id do on a daily basis i think its the most exercise ive had in years the heart was pumping
4434915 my parents were on their balcony watching it unfold about 200 metres away they were saying to each other itll be ok theres a man running down the jetty but they didnt realise it was me
4434916 a lot of people talk about us and say we play good football good football is good but we didnt win anything and you play to win
4434917 what we are going to keep in our heads is that playing football is good but sometimes you have to be tough on the pitch to win a game we have learnt a lot of things sometimes you have to be dirty to win some games you need to do that because it is part of football
4434918 against twente we didnt play good football and certainly didnt play our best but we won 2 0 and thats what its all about
4434919 we kept going and kept passing it sometimes you have to forget about trying to play beautiful football and just make sure you win the game that is the important thing although we have to remember the passing and movement that we want to do
4434920 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game
4434921 we can confirm we have received the inquiry report and we are currently looking at what action if any may be necessary
4434922 the western trust has worked closely with colleagues in other trusts the western health and social services board and the department of health to ensure the independent inquiry report recommendations are taken forward
4434923 the western trust established a senior management review group to consider each professionals input into mrs oneills care against what would be expected as best practice
4434924 the western trust is satisfied that a robust investigation was carried out appropriately in line with our procedures and the framework for handling concerns about doctors in the health and personal social services this included an independent review of medical practice by the same consultant psychiatrist used by the belfast health and social care trust in the context of this work a decision was made not to refer any individual to their regulatory body
4434925 im ecstatic that im in the final and i back myself against anyone in going for gold
4434926 the goal was to make it through to the final and ive done that
4434927 now ill give it everything and i hope that i do northern ireland proud
4434928 i want everyone to get up and watch me go for gold
4434929 this is going to be the biggest race of my life

4434932 this shows that our policy is in favour in concrete terms of the less well to do community furthermore the budget increase also refutes the notion that the government is merely engaged in idle rhetoric we took action and will continue to take action to alleviate poverty in our homeland
4434933 in the near future our economic growth rate shall replicate our gains during the 30 years prior to the crisis
4434934 in the near future our economic growth rate shall replicate the achievement we have had during the 30 years prior to the crisis
4434935 not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area chelsea will now be following the process laid out in the drcs decision to claim the money from mutu
4434936 promoted teams dont need any extra motivation on that first day
4434937 the first time with west brom we went to old trafford and we were only undone by a late solskjaer goal right at the end on saturday well be playing a team full of enthusiasm that finished last season on such a high and stoke could have sold their tickets six times over i know tony pulis very very well and his team will be 100 per cent fit theyll be difficult to deal with in terms of effort we have to match them
4434938 wed had the worst result of the season the week before against arsenal when we were 2 0 up at home against 10 men and lost 3 2 ive never known a result take so much stuffing out of a football club it was soul destroying
4434939 there were a lot of articles saying we were relegated including one from a well respected journalist saying bolton have gone and im pleased they have ive yet to see a retraction of that we football managers get judged every seven days but who judges him for getting that wrong
4434940 oh i would think he does considering who hes married to
4434941 i first saw him quite a few years ago when he was playing for brondby and he caught the eye then there were quite a few after him certainly another premiership club and wed have gone to 12m hes not a direct replacement for nicolas anelka hes an entirely different player theres not that many players like nic anyway although im sure its inevitable hell be compared which is maybe a little bit unfair hes not got that lightning pace nic has but hes an experienced striker and a great lad his wifes just had a baby so its new club new country new baby which is a lot to deal with but hopefully he will be what we want him to be
4434942 i bought gary cahill for 5m from villa with 17 premiership games under his belt and it seemed expensive but now it looks like a really good deal its just the way it is the standard transfer fee seems to change every year a couple of years ago it was 3m now you have to start at about 5m
4434943 in todays market id have been about 7m or 8m
4434944 no it was about 250 grand from plymouth to everton and it gradually went downhill from there thanks for reminding me of that
4434945 yeah i found that really strange given that hed just signed me a month before that might say something about brian clough as a scout i dont know i was a bag of nerves after that but when i became forest manager carole washington who was my secretary and had also been brians secretary gave me a message from brians widow what it said has to stay private but it was about my abilities as a manager and i can tell you it meant the world to me apparently hed been going to give me a ring but then he passed away
4434946 it was typical of the man that he slaughters me to the whole world and then i get a private message from beyond the grave
4434947 talking about how footballs changed he took us to majorca once and the players went to a bar about 50 yards from the hotel weve had too much to drink so instead of going back the 50 yards weve walked three miles around the other way because the senior pros said that brian would be between the hotel and the bar waiting for us we eventually get back about three in the morning its pitch black and we just hear gnight lads
4434948 he knew what wed do because he knew people he didnt treat me particularly well i was suicidal sometimes at forest but when i left he was terrific
4434949 i took west brom from second bottom of the championship to the premiership in 90 odd games and i didnt spend any money so youve got to find a way of doing it
4434950 you need drive and desire and i dont have a great deal of time for people who dont have that
4434951 i have fallen out with people at all different levels but theyve all been the same type people who were cheating the club that i was working for whether theyre players chairmen directors or supporters it doesnt matter if they get in the way i have to sort it out
4434952 football management is second only to kamikaze pilots in terms of precarious professions but you never know how anything is going to work out were playing stoke on saturday and tony pulis was slaughtered when he took that job again hes walking on water now there are a lot of managers who arent particularly glossy but i consider them proper managers they dont have 150m to go out and spend on a team that was already good
4434953 a lot of this is down to sams innovations but this place has changed a great deal over the summer if it didnt move its been painted and all the artworks changed we have photographs on the walls of the current players now there is a place for history but we need to move on now i want this to be a club where if we have a good season were scraping into europe but if we dont were not half an hour from relegation
4434954 in my capacity as the head of the provinces committee i call the political council for national security to hold an extraordinary session to discuss the disagreements on the elections law and to reach an agreement that satisfy everyone
4434955 most of the disagreements on article 24 of the law have been settled
4434956 the symposium being prepared between each of the iraqi centre for economic reform and the ministry of commerce after tugging between supporters to accelerate accession to the organization and usefulness of iraq and among claimants to wait until the iraqi economy regain its health or obtain guarantees of non loaded at energy has to deal with the requirements of the global free trade
4434957 symposium which was pending on the day of the session until after the panel completed their preparation which will include research documented reading of the laws of global trade and contexts and applications adopted by sami suggestive adviser at the ministry of trade while the number of researchers participating in the interventions of the requirements to qualify for involvement in iraq wto and its commitments to its broad directions

4434961 i commend costello development for that it showed a willingness to compromise
4434962 i dont believe that a gated entrance is compatible with the character of the community

4434997 besides apps that are used for e mail and personalized contacts and calendar were seeing some additional traction amongst crm apps sales field service there are also sparks of interest amongst inventory management and logistics apps
4434998 from a features and functionality standpoint on the crm apps organizations arent looking for the applications to do complicated algorithms rather they are looking to the mobile apps to provide field users with more customer related information such as service call information that the customer has asked for in the past and what sorts of things that a customer has purchased before
4434999 previously mobile apps tended to be focused on extending the line of business app like crm or order management
4435000 now the vendors are working on making their solutions plug into other systems easier out of the box capability to enable stronger cross visibility
4435001 besides rim there are windows mobile devices palm devices nokia devices and iphone devices that are being uses for enterprise mobile apps from what ive seen rim and windows mobile support the vast majority of mobile enterprise apps that includes e mail i think the chief strengths of blackberries include versatility and cost blackberry devices can support a variety of enterprise mobile apps on the device and device costs range from 100 200 on average
4435002 the browser is somewhat kludgy compared to the iphones browser it can be difficult to navigate and users sometimes must flywheel down to the bottom of pages to access links or enter data
4435003 i chose to put oss instead of devices because palm offers devices like the treo that operate on the windows platform
4435004 there are constraints for some handheld solutions running on different operating systems
4435005 for example oracle peoplesoft crm has a mobile handheld solution that runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry and microsoft dynamics crm runs on a windows mobile device but not a blackberry so if youre a buyer running those solutions as your enterprise crm apps and want to extend those capabilities out to blackberry devices that youve already rolled out for e mail you face a challenge
4435006 they offer a software layer that allows organizations to extend their crm application to multiple device types
4435007 devices definitely play a large role in managing the deployment of mobile applications from a developers perspective they must take into account the operating system and capabilities of the phone
4435008 for many developers ensuring their software is supported on many phones can be costly
4435009 sprint has a wide range of solutions that can address our customers needs regardless of the device they are carrying most smart phones can support a variety of business mobile apps and most devices are compatible with gps based business applications including several rugged devices that are well suited for tough business environments
4435010 even the most current mobile devices still provide a small fraction of the bandwidth screen size and memory available to desktop based applications
4435011 mobile applications must be designed to function well in such a limited environment
4435012 in addition we launched the oracle mobile business indicators to coincide with the launch of the apple app store on july 11th 2008

4435059 to be honest im very excited but very scared at the same time
4435060 there are restaurants right now that are changing menus lowering prices so people come out but im confident well have customers here

4435074 we are playing with peoples livelihoods if retailers are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money all well and good but we know from experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance our costs are going up and confidence is fragile the price cutting could force more farmers to go under

4435091 but im still in a hotel for at least another week and dont have a kitchen
4435092 what you do is you cut the top off of it take out the core and put it in the refrigerator to get nice and cold i used to make something called a drunken pineapple but i dont do that no more
4435093 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4435094 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4435095 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4435096 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4435097 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4435098 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4435099 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4435107 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4435108 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4435109 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4435110 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4435111 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4435129 sorry but youre gonna suffer for our incompetence even though you were available to come to work and its our fault you couldnt work tough luck
4435130 until i realised it was a salad full of bacon
4435131 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4435132 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4435133 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4435134 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4435135 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on in the environment
4435136 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4435137 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4435138 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab

4435141 i thought id write a new south african novel because we didnt have anything that was apparently attempting to face up to the new reality
4435142 up until 1994 there was something offensive about a south african story that simply bypassed politics
4435143 in theory thats not the case anymore were free to write about absolutely anything
4435144 but in practise its not so simple just because this is a very highly politicized society the society is still shaped by the weird politics that apartheid depended on so that even seemingly innocent subjects take you into that area
4435145 as the first african woman to receive this prize i accept it on behalf of the people of kenya and africa and indeed the world i am especially mindful of women and the girl child i hope it will encourage them to raise their voices and take more space for leadership
4435146 some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention

4435148 it is both gratifying and mpressive that the spectator magazine has reached a record 77 000 circulation when its website is powering ahead to almost 200 000 unique users and 2m page impressions a month
4435149 it looks like we are heading for even more troubled economic times our goal is still to reach sales of 80 000 but until market conditions improve we will be content to tread water at around 77 000 and look for further growth in online readership and revenues spectator co uk shows every sign of being the new crown jewels of our magazine group
4435150 these figures prove that our editorial strategy for the spectator is right we offer the best most intelligent and wittiest journalism in print and online
4435151 it was one of the most enjoyable writing challenges i can think of
4435152 being asked to make a story that had to be unrelentingly entertaining
4435153 all the stories were wonderful and as snappy as youd expect from such great writers

4435203 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4435262 at the end of the day you have two oil men in the white house and they represent big oil the republicans are doing the bidding of big oil
4435263 represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits
4435264 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil invest in the renewable energy sources crack down on excessive speculation and stand up to countries colluding to shake down american consumers

4435278 from knife culture to youth violence and all these gangs hanging around on the streets at night

4435292 the clear implication is that the school funding lost by the cut in property taxes will be fully replaced by the state of florida on an ongoing basis
4435293 based on the seriousness of the charges being made it is only appropriate that the fbi and other authorities begin investigating these allegations

4435297 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
4435298 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
4435299 one of the major problems we have in clinical trials for new melanoma therapies is that we cant identify the people who are going to have a slower disease progression no matter what they receive in a clinical trial
4435300 when new treatments are tested it is necessary to show clinical benefit by comparing patients who receive the new therapy with those who do not although patients might all have the same type of cancers there can be big differences in their survival simply because their cancers behave differently and this may have nothing to do with the treatment if we are able to identify the good players and the bad players up front it becomes a whole lot easier figuring out whether good results are due to the new treatment or not most importantly far fewer patients would be needed for the clinical trials its partly because we cant clinically identify subtypes of patients that we have to do very large and very expensive trials and of course this increases the time it takes to test the clinical benefit of potential new therapies

4435303 wenn ich telefonieren muss muss ich mich immer stark konzentrieren die richtigen zahlen auf dem telefon zu tippen
4435304 mir konnte bisher niemand erkl ren weshalb die zahlen auf der 10er tastatur eines computers anders angeordnet werden
4435305 das ist also historisch bedingt damals hatten telefone noch w hlscheiben warum bei den tastentelefonen sp ter eine andere ziffernreihenfolge gew hlt wurde entzieht sich unserer kenntnis
4435306 ursache f r die reihenfolge der belegung der telefontasten war die damalige technologie beim w hlen der einzelnen ziffern durch die drehw hlscheibe am telefon
4435307 erst als auch die mechanischen rechenmaschinen durch elektrische und elektronische ersetzt wurden erkannte man die unterschiede beider tastaturen
4435308 die hersteller von rechenmaschinen argumentierten dass sie soundso viele tausend ger te im feld h tten das gleiche argument brachten auch die telefongesellschaften vor

4435320 people see it in the news every day that u s gasoline consumption is down and it clearly is
4435321 they tend to assume that its happening in this country and its not the case its a different country with a much different economy and a different housing market all these things contribute to different behaviour by canadians
4435322 if youre a four wheelin enthusiast like we are you just go
4435323 it doesnt slow you down youre spending thousands of dollars on tires you spend thousands of dollars on parts and a few more bucks on fuel it really doesnt make a difference
4435324 people took that drop as signifying some sea change in the way people are behaving and i dont think the data says that
4435325 are we on pace for a drop in annual gasoline consumption no its basically flat it could very well happen but this is the data weve got so far
4435326 for the majority of people being on the road today costs more than last year
4435327 the gunning down of three female foreign aid workers two of them canadians and their afghan driver a few dozen miles south of kabul on wednesday is the latest bloody murder to underscore the relentless deterioration in afghan security conditions
4435328 here in beleaguered kandahar where i have lived for nearly seven years and currently run a small soap making co operative what most distressed my co op members was the gender of the victims
4435329 theyre killing women these people cant be afghans if my worst enemy my own personal enemy came into my hands but his wife was present i wouldnt touch him i would let him go
4435330 western coverage has brought to light other areas however where afghan and international perceptions of this tragedy diverge
4435331 this conflict however is different from most countries where international aid agences operate
4435332 neither the forces fighting the afghan government nor ordinary people make any distinction between international humanitarian workers the afghan government and international military forces all are seen as part of the same system
4435333 the vast majority of regular folk desire the presence of these interlocking groups
4435334 but the most important constraint on aid work is the risk it poses to afghans many villages in kandahar have been refusing development assistance for several years now they are afraid that the mere acceptance of these projects will transform their homes into targets
4435335 the afghans do not support this so called insurgency they are its primary targets

4435360 door verdere kostenbesparingen op de redactie van de krant af te wentelen loopt het vlaggenschip van dit concern zware averij op
4435361 hiermee zou op termijn niet alleen de werkgelegenheid van de redactie van de telegraaf op het spel komen te staan maar dreigt ook het voortbestaan van tmg in gevaar te worden gebracht
4435362 een verdere teruggang in mankracht dan al eerder is afgesproken is volgens de redactieraad absoluut onverantwoord en ontoelaatbaar
4435363 hiermee zou de kwaliteit van de krant ernstig worden aangetast
4435364 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
4435365 a while wallace was careful with her wording the fact of the matter is that mccain hasnt actually addressed his real problem
4435366 agents of intolerance mccain remains for many americans the candidate who ran against bush in the 2000 republican primaries independent fearless the maverick that is the mccain people remember and that is the gops great hope
4435367 changing the republican party between september and november will be increasingly difficult if not impossible
4435368 these things usually change because a president serves one terms or two but i do think mccains actually put good distance between himself and bush there are a number of reasons why its tough to be in a better position than mccain others are going to suffer because of the party brand with him its relatively less so
4435369 hes disagreed with the president on little things and hes agreed with him on big things and vice versa hes going to say what he believes you dont want to be a campaign of reaction you want a campaign that looks to the future people want to know what youre going to do for them in the future and not in the past
4435370 you can start out a year and a half out
4435371 but when it comes down to the last 100 days voters are looking for three ways youre going to change their lives
4435372 in sen mccain you have an energy policy thatll relieve us from foreign oil
4435373 a pro growth plan that emphasizes cutting taxes and helping small businesses which are the economic turbine of this country the other big choice is national security which is as stark as any in the last three or four presidential cycles
4435374 some of the challenges of running when youre the party in power are pretty obvious youve got someone who for a variety of reasons whose come down to the last months of his administration facing challenges you never run against that you just have to keep focused on the fact is the choice is between john mccain and barack obama

4435404 could have a substantial impact in industries such as the electronics and computer industries where the largest companies with hundreds if not thousands of patents regularly cross license each others portfolios to avoid internecine patent litigation

4435407 we carefully evaluated oxford biomedicas present situation from a management scientific and equity prospective based on our analysis we decided to resubmit our previous rejected offer at a higher price per share we strongly believe that genethera may indeed be in the position by acquiring oxford biomedica to bring substantial value both to the companys scientific platform and to its shareholders
4435408 genetheras dna vaccine technology purivax is a highly efficient system designed to greatly improve dna vaccines application in clinic trials oxford biomedicas renal cancer clinical trial trovax was recently halted because of its failure to improve survival rate in the patients enrolled in the trial we believe that our purivax technology would be a critical factor in getting the trovax clinical trial restarted and possibly successfully completed i would like to also point out that the merging of the two companies would create a major player in the field of dna cancer vaccines the new company will also be in the position to meet the requirements for a listing on the amex or nasdaq giving genethera and oxford biomedica shareholders a greater advantage when compared to the present situation
4435409 having recently received our mill permit it is exciting to see mill construction underway in addition now we have mill equipment at or being transported to our marshalling yard in laredo texas in anticipation of ultimately clearing customs on their way to the aguila mill site we are optimistic the next federal permit for the mill tailings facility will be granted shortly so construction of the tailings facility can begin permits dictate our production time frame and though we do not see any issues that would preclude the granting of the remaining permits it is apparent that our production time frame will now push into the first quarter of 2009

4435418 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe

4435420 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4435444 i dont want anyone to think they can create an entity that is exempt from our campaign finance reporting laws i think all groups should be treated equally
4435445 requiring groups like nmyo to register as a political committee when they conduct issue advocacy campaigns
4435446 have a severe chilling effect on these groups free speech rights
4435447 what im hoping is that cooler heads will prevail in the secretary of states office and that people will take a serious cautious and careful look at this before they start acting because all its going to do is buy litigation which nobody needs

4435512 if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit who dwells in you

4435516 i was surprised and disappointed that the worlds media immediately took the side of georgian president mikheil saakashvili last week

4435520 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4435521 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4435522 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100

4435524 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4435525 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4435526 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4435527 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4435528 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4435529 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4435530 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4435531 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4435532 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe

4435542 the city hath no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb was the light thereof

4435544 there was a rainbow round about the throne like unto an
4435545 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet it could go lower
4435546 its a big shakeout in gold and silver for people who have been long but dont really believe in the commodities
4435547 if you do it speculatively with leverage i dont recommend buying it now
4435548 the major issue in commodities is the proliferation of etfs and hedge funds as they unwind positions this leads to the price overshooting
4435549 dollar driven probably because we are supposedly seeing more writedowns in the european banks
4435550 we could see gold go all the way down to 750 an ounce
4435551 longer term we would not be surprised to see gold double
4435552 we would be aggressive buyers at current levels expecting gold to work higher through 2009 10
4435553 why should i put myself on the line and run for office when i will be up against such an ignorant electorate
4435554 disrespectful speech is not protected by the first amendment when you are engaging in speech in their house
4435555 a body such as the city commission should be spoken to with respect even if you do not feel that way
4435556 the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the inviolable rights of man and every person may freely speak write print and publish on any subject being responsible for the abuse of that liberty
4435557 under our broader guarantee it has been and remains the preference of this court to sanction a speaker after rather than before the speech occurs this comports with article one section eight of the texas constitution
4435558 every person shall be at liberty to speak write or publish his opinions on any subject being responsible for the abuse of that privilege and no law shall ever be passed curtailing the liberty of speech or of the press

4435560 what would you say if your wife brought another man into the bed
4435561 but you do not understand the purpose of charter schools
4435562 they are not part of the city so why should they be permitted to dump their brush for free

4435564 by october and more likely by september all best buy locations should have iphones on hand to sell to customers lavish video displays like those erected in apple retail store windows ahead of the phones launch may also turn up at the electronics stores
4435565 hopefully each of the major search engines will try to employ identical or compatible formats for site urls because it will be a hassle to have to keep up with multiple formats
4435566 pro bono publico for the common good currently yahoo seems to be just defensively immitating google in this arena and no ones showing signs of collaborating

4435568 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board

4435570 now icahn biondi and chapple can vote as a block although they wont be able to block anything outright on the 11 member board but they are not there to block anything really they are there to approve and encourage another deal that results in the sale of yahoo
4435571 the world expected that google with its unparalleled access to web wide data would validate publishers concerns and show that comscores numbers were significantly under reporting reality
4435572 vamos fazer uma nova licita o em rela o a isso s o contratos antigos de 2004 e 2005 e v o ser examinados caso a caso

4435574 in 1971 you have this crowd of people and smokers are dispersed among them but eventually by 2003 the smokers have been pushed to the periphery of the crowd
4435575 so at the same time we are trying to help smokers to quit we have unintentionally been hurting them by wreaking havoc on their social lives
4435576 one of the implications is its harder to reach smokers increasingly they are huddled together in groups that are not connected to other people who dont smoke
4435577 no tengo ninguna duda de que seremos competitivos en cualquier campo aun sabiendo que estamos en el inicio y que hay cosas a mejorar

4435579 prioritario de rendir bien en la vuelta de la champions y de empezar bien la liga
4435580 con la m xima seriedad ante un rival de prestigio internacional porque en el bar a no hay partidos amistosos o menos importantes
4435581 si piensa en el club y en la instituci n no se equivocar
4435582 s que en este club tranquilidad poca y no puedo pretender que la haya porque siempre se generan muchas noticias
4435583 hizo cosas extraordinarias que ojal pudi ramos igualar simplemente son ciclos que se acaban y entre todos nos vamos adaptando
4435584 ning n enfoque puede ser totalmente eficaz por si solo cada alumno es un individuo que debe recibir ayuda para encontrar su propia forma de ser aut nomo
4435585 las estructuras competitivas fomentan en los alumnos una orientaci n hacia la comparaci n ego sta o social
4435586 que se sienten obligados con respecto al resto del grupo a rendir positivamente
4435587 es probable que los mejores resultados ocurran cuando hay una combinaci n de relaciones de afecto y de apoyo cuando se destacan las tareas y los logros acad micos espec ficos y cuando existe un entorno razonablemente claro ordenado y bien estructurado
4435588 es normal para los actores chinos vestir diferentes ropas de variados grupos tnicos no tiene nada de particular
4435589 ellos utilizan diferentes vestuarios para transmitir el sentido de unidad amistad y felicidad entre la gente

4435641 the ground breaking open skies agreement allows european carriers to fly to anywhere in the u s and vice versa
4435642 amr just wants to be on par with star and sky alliances
4435643 and with open skies giving the ability to buy slots at heathrow one would think there is now a better chance of this getting approved
4435644 changed regulatory world where heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the u s and where rival alliances have immunity
4435645 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4435646 virgin understandably sees a threat in the two largest airlines from both sides of the pond linking up
4435647 corporate clients tend to negotiate with alliances with regional flying destinations virgin is not part of an alliance and its getting harder for them to compete
4435648 one thing is for sure we have to keep an eye on this
4435649 because its there because it could develop into something stronger and if it follows what the models are saying it will be in our vicinity over the weekend
4435650 several of our guidance models would like to make it a hurricane

4435662 anyone who watched the pageantry of the olympic games opening ceremony in beijing knows it is unlikely to be topped in our lifetimes
4435663 as someone who began formally studying chinese culture history and philosophy in 1973 i e beginning in university including several graduate level courses i was struck by the depth of the opening ceremonys many levels of representation and allusions
4435664 i was especially impressed with the lavish references to the tang dynasty and the voyages of admiral zheng he as the nbc commentator pointed out these two periods of chinese history were marked by a remarkable openness to the world and a stupendous exchange of goods and ideas
4435665 mammatus are pouch like cloud structures and a rare example of clouds in sinking air mammatus clouds are harmless and do not mean that a tornado is about to form a commonly held misconception in fact mammatus are usually seen after the worst of a thunderstorm has passed
4435666 what i saw was not just encouraging there was enthusiasm among the voters in the automation of the armm elections
4435667 with dre the entire process is fast and the results come out fast too so the losers will feel less pain as they await the results
4435668 the armm experience definitely proves that we can hold successful automated elections even in the most difficult circumstances with less than three months of preparation
4435669 saved us from having too many hands intervening in handling ballots since votes are electronically transmitted there is no human intervention in the counting and canvassing of votes

4435675 unfortunately there was no point in fighting against the tide of this bad luck

4435680 last summer he didnt do as well as he has done this year hes come in 40 kilograms heavier
4435681 at the moment having spoken to owner alan potts were going to stick to hurdling our view is that hes the highest rated hurdler over two miles in england and ireland so wed like to have another go at the champion hurdle
4435682 at the moment bar if things didnt look great early in the season well stick to hurdling
4435683 we need to change our mentality quickly for saturday facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4435684 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4435685 anyone who saw him abdoulaye faye that day will know why hes attracted us
4435686 hes a big lad who has plenty of experience at premier league level in such an important area of the pitch
4435687 he wants to move back to the north west and that has been a help in trying to get him here
4435688 hes strong and athletic and like his namesake has important experience at the top level we can call upon

4435733 in a similar vein affecting commercial sized farmers usda is having an ongoing tug of war over how to interpret the average crop revenue election program set to begin by the 2009 planting season schafer argues congress budgeted acre one way but that it wants usda to implement the program another way
4435734 at issue with acre is what year the program starts its two year rolling average for per bushel price models on crops the values can be dramatically different in corn for instance the 2006 average national price was 3 04 a bushel while the 2007 national average was 4 a bushel thats a two year average of 3 52 a bushel but that average could be significantly higher if the average 2008 price comes in over 4 a bushel
4435735 so where do you start schafer said were of course now getting letters from congress saying to start using 07 and 08 im not so sure thats appropriate were trying to sort this out i think there are some gray areas on this
4435736 a spokeswoman for the senate agriculture committee responded thursday that the language in the bill is generally understood to mean the prices for the 2007 and 2008 crop years
4435737 this is a procedure that usda followed in implementing the 1990 farm bill which set loan rates using recent crop year prices committee spokeswoman kate cyrul stated
4435738 senators who helped shape the new farm law say the agriculture department is improperly implementing a new policy on payments to farmers
4435739 but the department contends it is adhering strictly to the law as written and is not bound by a statement of intent that accompanied the legislation pl 110 246
4435740 the dispute centers on the threshold at which farmers can receive government payments the law bars payments if the sum of the base acres of a farm is 10 acres or less
4435741 department spokesman keith williams said schafers stance is that if congress intended to allow an aggregated 10 acre exception for payments they would have put it into law and they didnt
4435742 congress debated this provision but removed it to have their legislation save 34 million over five years in order to claim a budget scoring goal williams said
4435743 if congress decides to change the law and require us to consolidate the farms then the department will do it williams said we will follow the law as congress passes it
4435744 harkin and conferee charles e grassley of iowa ranking republican on the senate finance committee subsequently responded by saying there is no inconsistency between the explanatory statement and the statutory language the managers statement further clarifies that the statutory provision streamlines payment administration which is the very same purpose served by consolidating smaller bases acreages they said

4435779 the message is were creative architects maschke said during a recent tour of the house pausing on a rooftop terrace with sweeping views that encompass cityscape lake sky and highway
4435780 its funny now were starting to do interviews weve just begun to understand what were doing whereas before without doing interviews we never really thought about motives
4435781 but always with any sort of politics which is why we havent got any you get extremists and once you get extremists you get people doing great things and terrible things for every following of some sort you get followers who distort things if people dont understand things they should say so theres too much pride we dont understand
4435782 things have to go on were trying to show that it does not have to be pop punk next it doesnt have to be the same old rocknroll riffs we dont like trends we formed initially because we felt we had something of our own to say what was happening was lacking in certain aspects it needed a different point of view a variant on things but with the same attack impact
4435783 well theres the girl thing theres a lot of people whove latched on to us because of the because theyve understood things that arent there like being labelled nazis things like that many of the audience dont understand but thats irrelevant as long as they get the feel that were doing something different we probably dont understand ourselves completely
4435784 we can play rocknroll but we ignore it shove it in a corner we dont see ourselves in the same context as rocknroll groups were out on a limb it is dangerous but it excites us makes it worthwhile
4435785 maybe its because theres a lot more emotion put into what were doing now when you just get up there like we used to the emotion that comes up youre not realizing it
4435786 passion its just emotion full stop theres no other words its just one thing
4435787 now we seem to have some sense of direction though we dont know what it is over the last year we havent got tangled we have just kept a different way of doing things we havent just gone out and done every gig that weve been offered the best gigs are those when you go down really badly but you know youve done a good set we dont really need audience approval the way we approach it were out there and were putting on a show for ourselves and anyone who wants to put their hands in well they can
4435788 were not out to give everyone a good time oh you can come on stage youre the same as us its not like that cos we go on stage and its for us and if anyone wants to take something its up to them were not going to impose anything on anyone so in some aspects its not entertainment its entertainment for some people but its not mainstream entertainment
4435789 were very aware of coming across as pretentious and thats one thing that were all scared of so weve never actually said this is art this is that we leave it all open we dont define anything so we can go back on ourselves like anyone else and find things that we didnt see before we dont really like being tagged as anything but it is inevitable that people have to tag something to understand it
4435790 we want to become successful because it would mean that people are confronting what were putting down on vinyl and paper but if we are wed probably be successful for the wrong reasons and thats something we cant avoid
4435791 everyday theres a problem about having to compromise everyday theres a reporter wanting to interview just siouxsie take pictures of siouxsie getting across that its a backing band for siouxsie its not that at all its a four piece band who supports us who plays with us its so hard when theres not many we like getting certain people in on the guest list record company people having to deal with record company people because theyre so out of touch with things in the end you have to explain yourself in the most basic moronic way and that takes something away record companies arent there to help a band progress thats bullshit theyre there to give the bands a little money and make as much money for themselves they dont care if a band falls by the wayside as long as theyve made enough money out of them we havent signed any record deals we want commitment from a record company so that we can do what we want to do
4435792 in this age of child psychology nobody pays any attention to the actual psychology of the child all that seems to matter is the psychology of the psychologist and the particular theory or train of thought that he is maintaining against another psychologist most of the art and literature now magnificently manufactured for children is not even honestly meant to please children the artist would hardly condescend to make a baby laugh if nobody else laughed or even listened these things are not meant to please the child at best they are meant to please the child lover
4435793 however we like to be different in yorkshire the mount grace lady chapel in north yorkshire is a long established place of pilgrimage it is situated on a hillside above mount grace priory and within walking distance from the picturesque village of osmotherley in the north york moors national park
4435794 the lady chapel originated as an outlying chapel of the nearby carthusian priory of mount grace now belonging to the national trust but managed and maintained by english heritage
4435795 then he and donivan played leaving louisiana in the broad daylight which hadnt been recorded yet
4435796 emmy and i sang duets at waylons house for an hour
4435797 and rosanne was over in the corner next to susanna clark i would be disingenuous if i didnt admit that the famous family johnny cash and june carter wasnt a flame to the moth i was a big time fan of both of them and i was a young man drawn to that fame it was something rosanne and her sisters had to deal with all of their lives that was a subtle part of it but i also became captivated by her susanna noticed and said heres her phone number call her so i did
4435798 but i cant begin to explain how shy i was i was a bit overweight and didnt want people to see me but carlene was going to waylons party and she invited me to come along i was living with my dad in hendersonville and i tried on everything i owned but nothing looked good i was so depressed that i said no im not going they walked out the door without me and i opened the door and yelled at them hold on im going to come i just knew that for some reason i had to go
4435799 i went to germany to stay with a girl friend renata damm who worked with ariola records
4435800 i was following her around to all her meetings and christmas parties and these guys at ariola said wed like to hear a demo from you they were interested because i was johnny cashs daughter i figured no one in america will hear it so what the hell i might as well do it
4435801 and recorded three or four tracks thats when we started flirting our relationship was born out of our working somehow we got work and romance tangled into one thing we never were able to separate the two thats one reason we eventually separated if we werent working together what were we doing
4435802 i remember telling my dad when i was 18 on the road with him
4435803 i dont want to be somebodys little wife sitting at home i want to do something he was totally surprised he was shocked that i had any guts im glad to be rodneys little wife but only because he doesnt try to make me do anything that i dont want to do he encourages me to fulfill my potential i love being married its not what i thought it was i thought it would be real stifling real boring but its not its wonderful the companionship the exchange of information
4435804 we went into her dads studio and tried a few tunes
4435805 and her natural talent rose to the occasion i started to believe in her and started to collaborate with her and push her she was very shy but in an innocent way i said try this do this it caught on and she began to grow i had never even thought about producing i joked you just used that as a ploy to get next to me but once i did it i enjoyed the work
4435806 he wanted me to record these jerk off songs i said no disco shit there was one song he wanted me to do and i said i am not going to do that song i hate it he had the musicians come in and cut a track on it but i said no way am i going to sing that song he said this song is going to be a big hit for someone i said fine for someone else not me after we finished my album he put his own voice on the tracks and had a number one hit in germany
4435807 of course he had to sing very high because the tracks were cut for me
4435808 i like how innocent i was but at the time i was so depressed i couldnt get out of bed i couldnt stop crying i saw how you could be manipulated into expressing something that wasnt you and i found that humiliating i told myself its going to be released just in europe no ones going to talk about my dad i can experiment and no one will know how it turns out i was thinking of myself as a european at that point i wasnt planning to go back i had an affair with an israeli pop singer then rodney called me in munich on my 23rd birthday
4435809 rodney and i started writing letters when i was in germany
4435810 he was recording his first album and was having a real hard time he was separating from his wife he had his little girl by himself and he had no money whatsoever he had to take the baby to the studio and put her in a playpen i was in love with him before that but i wouldnt admit it to him i called up my mother and i was crying i told her im so in love with this guy and hes married what am i going to do and my mother said you cant do anything you have to forget about him so i tried to i didnt make any advances to him until i was in germany and i started writing to him
4435811 i said yeah do you want brian to produce it i said yeah do you want me to represent you i said yeah it was that simple i had just been playing dodger stadium with emmy in front of elton john and i said ill do that ill make a record and have hits like emmy it was pretty jarring when it didnt happen that way
4435812 in this modern world were livin in the rules aint like theyve ever been
4435813 he slipped the handcuffs on behind my back then he left me freezing on a steel rail track
4435814 i had been writing folkie balladeer things but when i got to california i started writing differently
4435815 one of the first songs to come out of it was aint living long like this i was part of a rhythm section in a band so some of the things i wrote for a good while became more rhythmic given that that was my daily musical input the language and the melody were still just as important but the rhythm got underneath and became a part of it the chord changes though very simple were more designed to be played by a group of musicians its not what you would call a troubadour song its one of my songs most performed live by other bands just a good four to the bar rocknroll song
4435816 i know for a fact that it was the source we went straight for the art of elvira as opposed to the commerciality i was much more interested in exploring the song and finding some source of soul in there whereas making a hit record wasnt the first thing that came to mind
4435817 when my first record came out i ran off to germany with rosanne
4435818 i got back to l a on the day of carlenes record release party
4435819 after a long awful flight from munich i was exhausted from customs and when i got to the apartment i was sharing with rosey she wasnt there i didnt have a key so i broke a window let myself in took a shower changed and went to the party at the magic shop when i walked in rodney was sitting by the door i sat down next to him and didnt move the whole night he was no longer married and we were together from that moment on he started asking me to marry him hed ask me every day i never said no but i didnt think he was serious but i finally said yes and we got married in april
4435820 but i was kind of resentful of you i thought that you were given a chance to make records because you were johnny cashs daughter
4435821 but i didnt think you had paid your dues enough to make a record you had never slugged it out and if your closest friend and lover was judging you that way just imagine how other people were
4435822 theres no formal schedule of dues paying either i just paid them in other ways
4435823 when rick decided to sign me i said why not
4435824 everyone i knew was making records emmylou harris karen brooks carlene and rodney
4435825 i guess songwriters are making records now so thats what ill do i wanted to be part of that group but to do that i had to come out of my shell so i stopped being the shy plump girl and became the cute girl
4435826 even today im not a real good guitar player so if i play on my albums its for the personality of it it can be kind of sweet if im playing and singing at the same time for a long time i wanted to be good on the guitar now ive gotten to the point where i can accompany myself and write songs on the guitar
4435827 i didnt know what the hell i was doing and rodney didnt have a much better idea all i knew was go for the emotions and thats all i did we both have pretty good ears for songs we recorded a song called the winding stream a beautiful old carter family song but we decided not to go in that direction because it was too hippie
4435828 it was during the making of that album that we stopped being hippies
4435829 brian created a style in southern music the fusion of rock and country
4435830 when i started making records with rosanne it was an extension of that we recorded those records in the enactron truck with the same team of people only with me guiding it the fact that emmylous records became commercial and artistically successful at the same time stemmed from the fact that we didnt look at it commercially at all when i started working with rosanne we took the same approach
4435831 i was pretending to be a singer i knew i didnt have the real live ability i had no sense of my voice or how to place it or how to get around its limitations i was at the mercy of my voice if it was working a little bit i was really happy if it wasnt i didnt know what to do i had a gut feeling about what i wanted and i just found it by feel
4435832 she had inherited a tone in her voice from her father hers is real sweet when she doesnt sing too hard it has her fathers resonance when shes in a comfortable musical environment thats a real cool sounding voice i started to believe in her and started to collaborate with her and push her she was very shy but in an innocent way i said try this do this it caught on and she began to grow in confidence
4435833 i never would have done half the things ive done without rodney
4435834 he had so much more confidence in me than i had he had an unshakeable faith in me so many times i felt i cant do this i should do something else i should just stay home but he was unfaltering in his faith if for nothing else ill owe him for that for the rest of my life
4435835 she wrote a song called this has happened before played it for me and i was stunned
4435836 she possessed a kind of melancholy some of that lennonesque melancholy like youve got to hide your love away
4435837 i asked him not long ago i said if i had been you i would have had severe reservations about marrying me
4435838 and he said well i did at first just because my family is so intense they all are all of them i cant explain to you how intense all of the back and forth is the little things that go on and he said yeah and you know he separated me from that
4435839 besides we were really in love when you marry and have you own family that naturally helps you get a distance from it i dont need to be enmeshed in all the goings on of my sisters and my parents i have to put that energy into my kids we really make a conscious effort to stay out of it you cant lead their lives for them
4435840 and they said this is a country record i said no its a pop record like the eagles or the byrds i know what country music is and this isnt it i thought i was signed to columbia not columbia nashville
4435841 i thought my songs would go straight to the top of the charts emmy had been so successful that we thought wed all be that successful we were shocked when rodneys first album flopped

4435901 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4435902 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4435903 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4435904 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4435905 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change
4435906 the federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesnt mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides
4435907 this opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet that even though money doesnt change hands attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy
4435908 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now you are probably thinking about beaches sunsets and other abstract information on the other hand if you were going to cancun tomorrow you would be thinking about taxi cabs and boarding passes concrete concerns making you more likely to process information about speedy check in or the phone number of a taxi
4435909 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
4435910 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
4435911 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race
4435912 rising mortgage and other living costs are behind the increase in repossessions as people struggle to pay the bills

4435929 there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4435930 all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india
4435931 we have taken special measures to insulate the poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices our government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers we have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under pds public distribution system
4435932 we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices the reserve bank of india is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4435933 the problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove our efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve health care services for all citizens will continue
4435934 i promise to you that we will continue striving for the development and prosperity of our country we will work hard to take the country to greater heights in all fields
4435935 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4435936 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
4435937 after almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004 investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this area
4435938 we have gone beyond the recommendations of pay commission in increasing emoluments of employees
4435939 insulate the poorer sections of society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices

4435974 we still have work to do at some of our schools particularly at the middle school level but i am pleased that the large majority of our schools are doing what it takes to meet standards which rise every year
4435975 it really is a cumulation of the msa results that we got weeks ago
4435976 there are forces in place with curriculum department to deal with the schools
4435977 this system has rallied around these schools and has put the measures in place to help them succeed next year

4436018 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia

4436020 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia

4436022 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency

4436071 this survey could give some hints if us consumers are able to drag the economy out of the mud
4436072 they will eventually start cutting rates from the early part of next year and that will be a key factor which will contribute to more euro weakness
4436073 we probably have seen the top of the euro at 1 60

4436075 how do you get a job as a tour caddie
4436076 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4436077 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4436078 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4436079 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4436080 y familiares ya est n aqu y eso como pod is imaginar es una muy buena noticia
4436081 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4436082 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4436083 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4436084 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4436085 deer drive is an entirely different animal when it comes to hunting games

4436087 i think with that score i can be up there with the medals im just going to swing big
4436088 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4436089 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4436090 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4436091 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4436092 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4436093 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4436094 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4436095 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4436096 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4436097 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4436098 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4436104 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4436105 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4436106 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4436107 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4436108 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4436109 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4436110 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4436111 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4436112 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4436113 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4436114 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4436115 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4436116 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4436117 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4436118 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4436119 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4436121 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4436122 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4436123 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4436124 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4436125 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4436126 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4436127 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4436128 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4436129 specifically authorized purposes of lake lanier as navigation hydropower generation and flood control with water supply as an incidental benefit
4436130 the issue is atlantas greed and gluttony versus floridians necessity and survival
4436131 oyster beds are being reduced and shrimp are disappearing and if the problems continue tourism will decline along with the seafood industry even honey production is affected because the rivers flood plains are drying up which hurts tupelo blooms
4436132 the irrigation bill limits lawn watering to two days a week most of the year and once a week during late fall and winter it gives city employees authority to write tickets for violations a warning the first time 50 the second time 250 after that
4436133 i seem to recall most restrictions have been lifted yet the drought continues go figure
4436134 recreational fishing exposed sandbars and the plight of farmers in the counties surrounding the apalachicola river
4436135 it is both ironic and telling that commissioner branchs comments about the apalachicola river and the plight of florida farmers in surrounding counties could have equally applied word for word to lake lanier and the plight of georgia farmers in the counties surrounding lanier
4436136 city council inacting a permenant water restriction law and the ne florida area is not under drought conditions like atlanta is
4436137 florida is demanding water from north georgia even though north georgia is in a drought condition and florida isnt
4436138 thanks to georgia the oyster fishing has not died out entirely from these past droughts let alone this one far from being the big bully on the block usace georgia and the reseveroir system has kept your business running without gaining a benefit from doing so
4436139 when the rivers temperature rises and the level of dissolved oxygen plummets
4436140 georgias rules for water quality control require a minimum daily average instream concentration of 5 mg l for dissolved oxygen in the chattahoochee river below peachtree creek
4436141 look we need to conserve some of this water change the rulings
4436142 richs i think that releasing more water from lanier when it rains is exactly what they are doing july 13 for example we get over an inch of rain and the lake goes up by less than half an inch
4436143 if you look at april numbers it is clear that approx 500 cf s can take care of atlantas needs even if you adjust that up by half to compensate for summer needs you get a figure of 750 cf s
4436144 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4436145 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4436146 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4436147 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4436148 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4436149 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4436150 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4436151 who are open to doing something on the production side
4436152 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4436153 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4436154 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4436155 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4436156 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4436157 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4436158 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4436159 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4436160 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4436161 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4436162 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4436163 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4436164 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4436165 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4436166 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4436167 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4436168 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4436169 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4436170 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4436171 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4436172 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4436173 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4436174 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4436175 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4436176 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4436177 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4436178 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4436179 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4436180 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4436181 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4436182 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4436183 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4436184 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4436185 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4436186 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4436194 the sun evaporates 2 10 of laniers water each day
4436195 its raining again on the north side of lake lanier
4436196 not at the dam you idiot north of the lake where it actually drains into it
4436197 the shallower water conditions could expose sandbars or stumps to those swimming or boating boaters should be cautions as declining levels may reduce clearance over underwater obstructions
4436198 the dropoffs arent new they may just be in unfamiliar territory
4436199 as the water goes down thats what exposes or makes the dropoff closer to the waters edge
4436200 gee therell never be another flood like this one in my lifetime
4436201 employers have told us that the delays in processing these criminal record checks are causing serious staffing problems for them most noticeably in the adult social care sector
4436202 i cannot allow these delays to impact on the care of those vulnerable adults and children who rely on health and social care services this emergency legislation is a temporary but necessary step to address this problem
4436203 labour should not underestimate how bleak a picture these figures paint
4436204 as drugs get stronger the harm they are doing to young peoples mental health is increasing the government needs to wake up to the scale of the problem we face on drug misuse
4436205 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4436206 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4436207 we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4436208 ets had a long history of international failure before they were signed up by this government to run sats tests ministers bear direct responsibility for signing up with a firm that let down children and teachers so badly
4436209 it is important that we learn the lessons of this years delays including for the 2009 test cycle
4436210 the government needs to take this golden opportunity to completely overhaul its testing regime and in the interim should suspend sats for 2009
4436211 in the long term appointing a new administrator for these tests is akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic
4436212 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4436213 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4436214 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 a threefold increase
4436215 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4436216 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4436217 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message as we strive to further improve our green credentials
4436218 it was really important that if we were going to redevelop the north market that it had to have that kind of permanency so thats why at the end of the day we looked at the courts
4436219 is the court the perfect tenant maybe not but can we live with it absolutely
4436220 to protect the north market vendors and to make sure that theyve got a viable place to show up every weekend the courts is a no brainer its guaranteed revenue
4436221 this is a community project it comes out of a community vision
4436222 the citys studies are three years old this area has grown considerably in the last three years
4436223 so to say that their studies relate to 2008 let alone 2014 is ludicrous
4436224 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4436225 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4436226 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4436232 hes a very athletic player he played every minute in the league for his club last season and hes also very versatile

4436234 i have some interesting news about the weekend i will share with you later

4436290 as a very concerned citizen i have to wonder why pornography isnt even an issue on the radar screen in the upcoming elections i can certainly understand why certain sectors of the population dont bring it to the forefront and i can understand why candidates dont address it but why dont organizations like mim bring it up constantly id really like to nail down the candidates on their views and the methods they plan to use to enforce pornography laws then hold them to it please please please do what you can my letters and emails to candidates go unanswered
4436291 were the next president to do all in his or constitutional power to ensure that federal obscenity laws are enforced vigorously against commercial distributors of hardcore pornography would you support or oppose the president in this matter
4436292 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
4436293 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president
4436294 i hope i die before this dog does i just couldnt stand it
4436295 in the past the venues have been much smaller for this one weve been here since thursday getting things ready
4436296 the problem is arcade owners dont know anything about gamers or what gamers really want to play
4436297 we dont run neo empire events for profit and well be lucky to break even this time but we want to keep the fighting game scene alive because thats our passion
4436298 you can use it to cancel on start up and on recovery it acts as a linking mechanism
4436299 it allows you to dash forward and keep up the pressure but the important thing is its really simple to do as you only need to hit two buttons

4436301 after edwards confessed the affair to his wife he restarted it and was sexually involved with rielle when she became pregnant
4436302 despite his denials edwards was aware that his former finance committee chairman fred baron was funneling money to rielle
4436303 experts are now calling for a federal investigation into edwards use of campaign funds

4436306 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
4436307 very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia
4436308 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4436309 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4436310 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4436311 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals
4436312 anyone who saw him abdoulaye faye that day will know why hes attracted us
4436313 hes a big lad who has plenty of experience at premier league level in such an important area of the pitch
4436314 he wants to move back to the north west and that has been a help in trying to get him here
4436315 hes strong and athletic and like his namesake has important experience at the top level we can call upon
4436316 we need to change our mentality quickly for saturday facing sunderland away will be a very tough game they have strengthened their squad and are always difficult on their own ground
4436317 we would have preferred that he did not need to play we waited and waited but in the end we needed him because we were not in control of midfield
4436318 we treated him and tried to get him back for punchestown but it just wasnt happening hes had a really good holiday and he looks a million dollars hes moving better hes better than he ever was
4436319 last summer he didnt do as well as he has done this year hes come in 40 kilograms heavier
4436320 at the moment having spoken to owner alan potts were going to stick to hurdling our view is that hes the highest rated hurdler over two miles in england and ireland so wed like to have another go at the champion hurdle
4436321 at the moment bar if things didnt look great early in the season well stick to hurdling
4436322 yes it was a war online to purchase your tickets it was all sold out so soon

4436326 you cant just run around doing all those little crazy things
4436327 you have to be professional at all times coming in as a rookie you have to show em what you can do
4436328 i know how hard it is on those guys coming in not knowing if theyre going to make the team trying to learn a new offense trying to learn a new city learn new players
4436329 its hard man we try to keep everything fun and light hearted around here
4436330 a lot of the vets have opened their arms to us but dont get us wrong were still rookies
4436331 even with getting a big contract all that can be gone just like that and its like what happened

4436334 buna sunt ramona am 26 ani si as dori sa va cer o parere am o relazie stabila de aproape 2 ani si prietenul meu tine ca in curand sa ne casatorim insa eu am o problema cand facem dragoste ma simt bine dar nu reusesc niciodata sa ajung la orgasm avem un raport foarte frumos dar eu reusec sa ating placerea maxima doar cand ma masturbez e un subiect intim si destul de delicat si nu stiu cui as putea sa ma adresez pentru un sfat sau o parere prietenului meu nu i am vorbit pentru ca ar putea ramane dezamagit credeti ca as putea gasi o solutie sau ar fi mai bine sa ma resemnez multumesc

4436337 i hope that the appointment of a chief and deputy administrator will soon be followed by the full establishment of the interim administration and move us all closer to the day when those displaced by mays fighting can return in safety and dignity to resume their lives in a secure environment
4436338 it is important to keep in mind that the au is pursuing a policy of stabilization of somalia and to achieve that objective we are bringing together the transitional federal government and the opposition i must say that the current prime minister of somalia nur hassan hussein has been very focused on talking to the opposition essentially the alliance for the reliberation of somalia ars and the alliance has also been very positive so we have jointly with the united nations facilitated the dialogue towards reconciliation between the tfg transitional federal government and the ars and this has led to the djibouti agreement
4436339 i think the two parties to the djibouti agreement are fully committed there is a high level political meeting and the security committee is meeting at a very high level in djibouti this weekend so there is a commitment and i would lead the au delegation so once we have launched this committee we hope that both the government and the ars will go in somalia and to galvanize the somali population i can tell you that when i was in somalias capital mogadishu i met with the civil society elders members of the cabinet and they are all for the total implementation of the djibouti agreement and i dont have any doubt that we are going to move forward
4436340 there is no rift as such there is only the difference in the interpretation on how the provisions of the constitution should be implemented i dont think there was a disagreement on the dismissal of the mayor of mogadishu what was the disagreement was how the process was conducted

4436344 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4436345 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4436346 who care deeply and have much invested in the evolution of windows
4436347 starting from the first days of developing windows 7 we have committed as a team to promise and deliver thats our goal share with you what were going to get done why were doing it and deliver it with high quality and on time
4436348 we believe the judicial review will uncover the predetermination flawed processes and inappropriate external political influences that led to the electricity commission approving transpowers horrendous 220 400kv proposal for a 200km transmission line on 70m pylons into auckland
4436349 there were four clear errors in law made by the electricity commission including illegality irrationality pre determination and bias and mistake of fact
4436350 the decision that the commission arrived at to approve the transpower proposal was not one that a reasonable unbiased person would come to if the law had been followed
4436351 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4436352 in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up
4436353 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4436354 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4436355 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4436356 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4436357 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4436358 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4436359 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4436360 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4436361 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4436362 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4436363 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4436364 we commend the four trade associations for using their influence to change these intolerable practices
4436365 combined these trade associations represent almost 100 of all purchases of cotton products in the united states the fact that they are meeting with the ambassador of uzbekistan are publicly condemning forced labor and asking for international monitoring sends a clear message that forcing children to pick cotton must end immediately
4436366 we need to see concrete measurable actions taken immediately by the government of uzbekistan
4436367 we have heard only denials and empty promises coming from this government for too long
4436368 although many companies have said that it is impossible to trace the source of their cotton purchases that may occur several steps down the supply chain we have found that where there is a will there is a way
4436369 companies are finding that it is indeed possible to trace the source of their cotton and we believe responsible companies have an obligation to do so
4436370 we have heard from several of our portfolio companies that they feel their efforts are best placed in industry initiatives while those initiatives play a crucial role we believe retailers must address child labor within their own global supply chain right down to the cotton fields where some of the most egregious human rights and environmental violations occur
4436371 it is our experience that collaborative efforts of investors non governmental organizations trade unions companies and industry associations can make a difference
4436372 we would like to see many more u s companies join in our shared goal and publicly take actions to help address ending forced child labor in uzbekistan
4436373 we know this situation is not going to change over night
4436374 by leveraging influence from a number of different angles simultaneously we have the opportunity to make significant and lasting change this type of change will benefit children workers investors and consumers world wide
4436375 i wouldnt say it happens every winter but yes that happens every now and then
4436376 its a concern but theres no problem yet once it gets up to lawn level thats when we get concerned it came up that high about five years ago

4436382 it seems beyond belief that they can be on their own record as to the importance of the structure plan and now suggest it was all a mistake
4436383 we were floored that the council pushed ahead with the hearing but were even more shocked now the council appears to be doing everything it can for the developers and changing the rules to suit
4436384 the hearing is fundamentally flawed its exclusionary its wrong in law and there are issues surrounding it that are far from resolved the council is doing things backwards
4436385 ours was a defender it could push all the rings
4436386 its been brilliant and exposes them to new challenges they have been really engaged its good for them to compete with the boys theyre trying to break down a few barriers
4436387 these are seriously big robots there are millions invested in running this competition
4436388 its really fun to do things with your hands and learn to put robots together

4436393 they have created a tremendous company here its a company that we have wanted to bring into verizon wireless for the last 10 years
4436394 i dont think any other company but verizon wireless could have bought alltel and taken it to the next level

4436408 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4436409 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4436410 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4436411 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time

4436439 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4436440 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4436441 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4436442 but in the end we must all accept gods limits atheist or no
4436443 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4436444 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4436445 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4436446 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4436447 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4436448 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4436449 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4436450 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4436451 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4436455 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
4436456 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
4436457 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
4436458 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
4436459 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
4436460 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
4436461 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
4436462 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
4436463 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
4436464 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
4436465 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat

4436467 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict

4436474 no holds barred if side effects occur consult a physician
4436475 im going now to talk to georgian president saakashvili about the clarifications that the french have provided
4436476 and then well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap
4436477 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4436478 of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4436479 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalise their presence in georgia
4436480 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4436481 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4436482 there are seven eight nine people who im fairly sure i know are going to make the finals now
4436483 its incredibly open and it will feel different i think to other years
4436484 she has an incredible vocal but i think shed be a nightmare to work with

4436486 and for the girls look out for joseph hes gorgeous
4436487 shes a great judge she knows what shes looking for shes really good at it and were having a good time
4436488 and i just love it when she sticks it to simon
4436489 i find the whole stuff about me and dannii not getting on and dannii being older and all of that really quite insulting to both of us to be honest
4436490 and i think last year we probably had too many emotional stories on there and we probably ended up with maybe not as strong a 12 in the final as we could have

4436506 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4436507 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4436508 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4436509 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4436510 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4436511 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4436512 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4436513 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4436537 they said they knew arashi from that and later watched yamada taro monogatari goodness how do these american fans watch so many dramas it doesnt play on tv there does it
4436538 i didnt really watch tv in california but nobody recognized me they must not watch dramas on tv
4436539 maybe so but of course our american fans watch dramas so they watched us in yamada taro monogatari and they thought you looked like a little kid they thought i looked too old for a high school student
4436540 but they thought you were cute so they started liking you more than jun kun and they liked you in iwo jima stand up sukoshi wa ongaeshi ga dekitakana marathon ao no honou kiiroi namida yasashii jikan haikei i think theyre listing everything youve been in

4436542 no they dont speak much japanese but they say that people translate it
4436543 i guess so this person says they also buy magazines and those articles are translated as well
4436544 is this all online so amazing i wonder why weve never heard of this
4436545 yeah i know i wonder if they translated my radio show
4436546 but you know this must be illegal or something like rules or copyright
4436547 maybe maybe but anyway the letter is almost done they say that were so amazing of course and we should come to america for our 10th anniversary of course and that the people on the internet are so amazing for helping international fans reach arashi
4436548 yeah i suppose its good even if its maybe illegal another american fan said that she came to 3 concerts and bought every one of our albums so it cant be bad
4436549 yes i remember i had to translate that letter for you too you know even jun kun doesnt make me translate english letters for him when he gets more than you but continuing this one said something i couldnt really understand she said she writes fan fictions do you know what that means nino
4436550 it has the same meaning in english right its like a book or a drama thats not real
4436551 i believe so and fan we know what that means
4436552 so does that mean they write books about us or something
4436553 ah so it exists here too so i think they write stories kind of like fan art here search for
4436554 my first ficcie plz dont be mean im a bad writer
4436555 wow you seemed so absorbed in that for a while what did it say i can see nino in there is it about me
4436556 nino i dont think you want to know about this
4436557 its detailed though you know have you ever read murakamis norwegian wood
4436558 of course i have its being made into a movie now did you know that
4436559 well this is like that novel except its in english its kind of differently written but its about you and ohno
4436560 so from ohmiya sk and whatnot do people really think were dating i hope people realize we just do these things for fun
4436561 maybe they just like to imagine it i think thats probably it you know
4436562 i see well i hope people writing this at least know we date women
4436563 yeah i hope they do well so many people wrote in to ohno so i think people in america know about these kinds of things
4436564 hey sho kun i think we should try and find some fan fictions about you
4436565 im not going to read the whole thing okay i couldnt even stomach all of yours so dont expect so much when im reading h stuff about myself
4436566 shoooooooo chan aiba called out lets play a gaaaaaa me
4436567 what kind of game asked a suspicious sho serious after returning from news zero
4436568 i dont know oh oh a and also sho kun and and aiba them too

4436578 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4436579 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4436580 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4436581 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4436582 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4436583 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4436584 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4436585 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4436586 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4436587 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4436588 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying

4436594 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4436595 thats why we want to bring out the information now
4436596 there are some things you can do now to reduce your energy use
4436597 we want to sure people are not missing the information that might help them cope with these heating bills that will be quite a lot more than last year
4436598 the wyoming journal last week reported that home heating bills in casper could increase anywhere from 50 90 this winter not just 47
4436599 we should be cheaper than the national average its all coming from our backyard
4436600 why is the price of oil shifting and with it the price of gasoline in ways that seem to make little sense on the surface were using less but gas is not dropping at the same rate that the cost per barrel for oil is hmmm heres the explanation
4436601 they provide an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal
4436602 wow all these people complaining about not having any money yet in the middle of a work day their on the internet reading the paper
4436603 the glut argument made by the energy brokers theres too much gas not enough pipeline space thats why we take a hit on gas prices in wyoming
4436604 time to get my buffalo robe back out for the winter
4436605 rex my post is two parts an observation and a comment
4436606 yes you dolt you may take free drop when your ball comes to rest on a sprinkler head one club length no closer to the hole idiot
4436607 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4436608 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4436609 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years

4436613 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4436614 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4436615 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4436616 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4436617 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4436618 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4436619 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community

4436621 intelligent tutoring systems virtual laboratories browse through lectures on a wide range of subjects simulations and frequent opportunities for assessment
4436622 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4436623 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4436624 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4436625 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4436626 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4436627 does anyone out there think barack obama is too thin to be president anyone having a hard time relating to him and his no excess body fat please let me know thanks
4436628 yes i think he sic is to sic skinny to be president i wont vote for any beanpole guy
4436629 the article should have disclosed that the reporter used the bulletin board to elicit the comment
4436630 n either chozick nor onlinebeerbellygirl has made any other posts on yahoo before or since and both profiles appear to have been created on 7 15 the day chozick started the topics it certainly looks like amy chozick constructed the whole thing
4436631 do wsj reporters make up fake ids and make up fake quotes cached copy is available here
4436632 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4436633 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4436634 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4436635 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4436636 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4436637 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4436638 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4436639 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4436640 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4436641 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4436642 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4436643 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4436644 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4436645 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4436646 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4436647 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4436648 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4436649 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4436650 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4436651 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4436652 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4436653 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4436654 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4436655 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4436656 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4436657 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4436658 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4436659 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4436660 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4436661 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4436662 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4436663 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4436664 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4436665 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4436666 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4436667 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4436668 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4436669 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4436670 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4436671 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4436672 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4436673 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4436674 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4436675 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4436676 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4436677 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4436678 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4436679 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4436680 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4436681 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4436682 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4436683 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4436684 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4436685 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4436686 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4436687 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4436688 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4436689 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4436690 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4436691 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4436692 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4436693 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4436694 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4436695 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4436696 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4436697 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4436698 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4436699 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4436700 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4436701 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4436702 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4436703 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4436704 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4436705 who will be the next president of the united states
4436706 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4436707 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4436708 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4436709 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4436710 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4436711 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4436712 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4436713 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4436714 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4436715 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4436716 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4436717 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4436718 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4436719 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4436720 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4436721 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4436722 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4436723 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4436724 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4436725 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4436726 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4436727 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4436728 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4436729 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4436730 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4436731 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4436732 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4436733 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4436734 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4436735 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4436736 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4436737 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4436738 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4436739 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4436740 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4436741 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4436742 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4436743 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4436744 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4436745 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4436746 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4436747 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4436748 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4436749 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4436750 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4436751 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4436752 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4436753 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4436754 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4436755 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4436756 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4436757 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4436758 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4436759 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4436760 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4436761 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4436762 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4436763 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4436764 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4436765 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4436766 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4436767 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4436768 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4436769 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4436770 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4436771 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4436772 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4436773 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4436774 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4436775 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4436776 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4436777 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4436778 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4436779 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4436780 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4436781 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4436782 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4436783 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4436784 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4436785 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4436786 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4436787 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4436788 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4436789 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4436790 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4436791 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4436792 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4436793 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4436794 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4436795 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4436796 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4436797 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4436798 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4436799 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4436800 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4436801 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4436802 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4436803 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4436804 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4436805 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4436806 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4436807 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4436808 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4436809 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4436810 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4436811 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4436812 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4436813 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4436814 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4436815 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4436816 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4436817 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4436818 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4436819 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4436820 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4436821 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4436822 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4436823 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4436824 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4436825 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4436826 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4436827 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4436828 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4436829 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4436830 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
4436831 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4436832 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
4436833 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4436834 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4436835 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4436836 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4436837 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4436838 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4436839 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4436840 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4436841 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4436842 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4436843 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
4436844 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
4436845 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
4436846 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
4436847 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
4436848 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
4436849 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
4436850 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
4436851 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
4436852 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
4436853 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
4436854 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
4436855 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
4436856 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
4436857 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
4436858 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4436859 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4436860 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4436861 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4436862 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4436863 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4436864 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4436865 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4436866 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4436867 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4436868 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4436869 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4436870 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4436871 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4436872 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4436873 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4436874 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4436875 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4436876 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4436877 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4436878 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4436879 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4436880 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4436881 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4436882 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4436883 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4436884 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4436885 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4436886 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4436887 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4436888 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4436889 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4436890 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4436891 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4436892 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4436893 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4436894 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4436895 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4436896 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4436897 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4436898 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4436899 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4436900 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4436901 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation
4436902 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4436903 when the rbi is selling dollars and crude prices are going up then the rbis action is negated
4436904 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
4436905 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
4436906 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
4436907 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
4436908 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
4436909 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
4436910 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
4436911 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
4436912 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
4436913 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
4436914 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
4436915 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
4436916 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
4436917 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
4436918 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
4436919 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
4436920 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
4436921 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
4436922 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
4436923 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
4436924 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
4436925 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
4436926 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
4436927 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
4436928 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
4436929 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
4436930 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
4436931 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to

4436949 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying

4437000 by way of introduction the obvious cannot be overstressed here namely that israel is the occupier and therefore the aggressor while the palestinians are the occupied and therefore the victims paradoxically this fact is hardly ever even taken into consideration by western politicians thus ignoring the fundamental element of the conflict needless to say attempting to solve this conflict without differentiating between the aggressor israel and the victimized the palestinians will never lead to permanent peace

4437006 if i were an arab leader i would never sign an agreement with israel it is normal we have taken their country it is true god promised it to us but how could that interest them our god is not theirs there has been anti semitism the nazis hitler auschwitz but was that their fault they see but one thing we have come and we have stolen their country why would they accept that

4437010 meanwhile more folk die while desperately trying to break the fairs fair
4437011 the character of the provisional palestinian state will be determined through negotiations between the palestinian authority and israel the provisional state will have provisional borders and certain aspects of sovereignty be fully demilitarized with no military forces but only with police and internal security forces of limited scope and armaments be without the authority to undertake defense alliances or military cooperation and israeli control over the entry and exit of all persons and cargo as well as of its air space and electromagnetic spectrum
4437012 strange in 1945 there was no israel either so whats your point that israel does not exist
4437013 the brits you spoke to are mistaken the problems in the middle east were started by the british and the french after world war one
4437014 as to where this policy of the british and later the americans originated we neednt look further than a series of meetings held in britain starting in 1905 headed by prime minister sir henry campbell bannerman from this a high committee was formed it specialized in matters of colonialism consisting of members from the participating states of leading historians social economic and agricultural analysts scholars geologists and experts in oil and gas the members of this committee met in london in 1907 the final decisions made by the conference were threefold 1 separating the muslim lands in the east from those in the west making their unity more difficult 2 planting a new enemy for the muslims on their lands in the first qiblah and the third of the holiest mosques this would draw their attention to a new enemy focusing all their energies on defeating him and in turn weakening their capability of resisting western aggression causing them to forget what occurred during the days of the crusades 3 establishing an advanced base for the disbelieving colonialists at the head of them britain to protect their interests implement their plans and schemes and ensuring the outflow of natural resources from the region as well as the import of their goods and products into the markets of the region the goal of the colonialist powers then and now is to keep arab peoples backwards by not enabling them to elect popular leaders and to control the vast mineral wealth that the arabs were fortune enough to possess
4437015 the sykes picot agreement concluded in 1916 divided the middle east into areas of influence for france great britain and others giving the french control over modern syria and lebanon

4437021 these are situations that are faced internationally and we have got to find a better way to try to make sure journalists are not caught up in crossfire

4437024 the balfour declaration illustrates the contradictions in a single paragraph

4437026 when the question of the british mandate over palestine was discussed in parliament it became clear that opinion in the house of lords was strongly opposed to the balfour policy as illustrated by the words of lord sydenham in reply to lord balfour
4437027 the harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an arab country arab all around in the hinterland may never be remedied what we have done is by concessions not to the jewish people but to a zionist extreme section to start a running sore in the east and no one can tell how far that sore will extend

4437056 dlrc auctions has not had such a small but powerful collection since the hoosier collection which realized right at 1 1 million in february 2008 the southern states sale should realize very close to that mark as there are many issues here that collectors have been seeking
4437057 it is not only something she deserves but something that historically shes entitled to to not allow her name to put in for nomination would be doing something different than has been done in the past
4437058 had they not allowed her name to be put in nomination it would have been disrespectful of her it would have been denying the women of this country who supported her and it would have been as the young kids say today it would have dissed her it would have been divisive this is something that theyre not giving her this is something i believe she is entitled to im pleased that this has been done this is an indication that at least the obama campaign is reaching out to her supporters there are other things that still have to be done one obstacle has been removed
4437059 i think its an appropriate reflection of the historic nature of her campaign and baracks i think its a great achievement and a celebration this was really a historic moment in our history when a woman can get within a hairs breadth of holding the highest office in the nation and in the world this gives her the perfect platform to call upon those who have given so much to her campaign to continue giving until we win i mean its a win win and maybe even her delegates will be he ones who put barack over the top but i think its a unifying historic ending it brings closure as we unite behind baracks candidacy
4437060 it gives honor to her and her supporters and it gets us all on the same page supporting barack i think its the perfect outcome and its something obama wanted as much as hillary did
4437061 i am thrilled and i really believe entering hillary clintons name for the nomination will help our party it will define a moment in history it will give everyone in the democratic party a chance to recognize this historic race hillary clinton ran and i think it will help bring the party together and we will come out of there unified and committed to our shared goal of defeating john mccain im very proud of all hillary clinton achieved in her historic campaign she shattered barriers she is respected she stood up for americans who most needed a champion its inspiring that a woman can be a viable candidate for the white house people are justifiably proud of what her candidacy represented
4437062 it was a brilliant strategy by both campaigns just brilliant because what it does is it both shows respect for hillary her campaign the historic nature of the campaign and creates a real vehicle for her to embrace sen obama and get her supporters to do the same because many of her supporters are still having a hard time by doing it in this way it just creats a respect for her that she deserves in the democratic party and creates a vehicle for her to unify the party which i think sen obama very much wants

4437079 on the surface cattle producers are unlikely to notice any differences in the new evaluation
4437080 under the surface however there are some distinct differences especially for breeders and commercial users of lim flex genetics
4437081 during its 40 year history in north america upgrading of limousin breed composition chiefly has occurred from angus based animals
4437082 so more accurate accounting for past and present day angus genetics also will enhance predictions for purebred and fullblood limousin animals
4437083 no other multibreed genetic evaluation in the world more thoroughly incorporates performance information from two populations of animals as does agis work for nalf
4437084 the epds and index predict genetic rankings among animals and they are the most accurate predictors of genetic merit

4437092 the fact that the parasite actively uses a component of the host hemoglobin as a way to protect itself against the defenses of the host is an interesting facet of the biology of parasites we discovered that the two subspecies of t brucei that can infect humans both possess tbhphpr
4437093 as the receptor shows equal affinity for the human specific hpr hb complex and the hp hb complex in contrast to the analogous human receptor cd163 which cannot bind hpr hb we deduce that tbhphbr is a parasite specific entry site for hpr hb thus the hprhb complex could be coupled to toxins and used as a novel drug against the parasite targeting only the parasite and not the host
4437094 our next step is to contribute to the development of these new conjugate drugs using the receptor as an entry point into the parasite the assay using a biacore system developed during this investigation will be essential for assessing binding of drug candidates to the receptor

4437099 previous studies have examined the role of parents in diabetes self care and found that parental influence decreases during adolescence as friendships and school life become more important during adolescence examining the influence of school personnel and peers was pertinent there were few studies examining this area so possible outcomes were unknown
4437100 the impact of teachers on young people with diabetes cannot be overestimated given that poorer self care increases the risk of complications including unconsciousness seizures and coma as well as serious long term problems such as blindness and kidney failure
4437101 diabetes is a legally recognised disability all young people with the condition have the right to appropriate school care to help them fully take part in school life young people with diabetes must be allowed to undertake care at any time at school schools need to make all staff aware of pupils with diabetes and their related care needs and staff must be trained in recognising and treating hypoglycaemia

4437108 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4437109 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4437110 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4437111 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4437112 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4437113 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4437114 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4437115 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4437116 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4437117 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4437118 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
4437119 robert michael educational institute llc recognizes that continuing medical education plays a crucial role in the provision of quality health care and is dedicated to offering professionals meaningful opportunities for lifelong learning
4437120 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4437121 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4437122 it is possible that testing for this abnormal expression may become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4437123 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer
4437124 deet has been shown to be an extremely safe and effective repellent
4437125 natural is a word that is sometimes used to promote safe products unfortunately the wording can be misleading for the uninformed individual natural products are usually essential oils distilled from plants these oils can be toxic and irritating in high concentrations natural repellents are not necessarily safe repellents
4437126 there is no scientific evidence that eating garlic vitamins onions or any other food will make a person repellent to mosquitoes
4437127 it is also unlikely that b 1 skin patches will work either
4437128 there is no evidence that wearing devices that emit sound will repel mosquitoes
4437129 bug zappers do not control mosquitoes and can reduce the populations of beneficial insects
4437130 the truth is although many home remedies and oddball uses of everyday products do serve to repel mosquitoes somewhat they dont work very effectively for very long
4437131 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4437132 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4437133 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4437134 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4437135 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4437136 a military mastermind who takes part in hatching a plot to wipe out nazi leaders
4437137 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
4437138 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
4437139 the way this disease grows and spreads has perplexed clinicians and researchers for nearly three decades during which time the dismal outcome for metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma has remained essentially unchanged despite improvements in surgical technique radiation delivery and chemotherapy
4437140 a therapeutic strategy for children with muscle cancer might be developed that would target this growth receptor and possibly similar ones at the same time
4437141 the benefit to the patient is that such treatments are clinically available today for adult cancer patients who have other diseases importantly too the way these targeted therapies work is less toxic than chemotherapy
4437142 we believe this clearly establishes platelet derived growth factor receptor a as a potential future therapeutic target in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
4437143 moving our results to the clinic will require close attention and further study of how tumors become resistant to this drug
4437144 we will have a look at him over the next week

4437149 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4437150 i knew at that moment that i was going to give it everything i had
4437151 i know i had so many doubters over the last few years with my injuries and people thinking that i was older than the other girls but i proved everyone wrong when i came out here and i feel stronger than ever

4437158 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4437159 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4437160 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4437161 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4437162 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4437163 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4437164 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4437165 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4437166 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4437167 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4437168 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4437169 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4437170 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4437171 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4437172 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4437173 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4437174 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition
4437175 my brother is getting ready to take his entire family to orlando for a vacation

4437185 the queen is a profoundly unifying force no matter what your background what your heritage where your grandparents came from we can all unite with her as our personal head of state
4437186 not content with trying to run public policy and things that should be left to the elected government here we have an example of human rights lawyers wanting to usurp the queen
4437187 what i was talking about was the rule of law and the importance of the rule of law and that means nobody is above the law

4437197 she then said im attacking you to the congolese woman then the next one will be gloria and the third one is sisay all these people i want you out of here so it was a big fight
4437198 they have to leave the shelter because we actually invited them to the shelter to provide for them in their time of need
4437199 we are convinced that conditions exist in all the communities within gauteng for all the displaced people to safely return to their places we dont expect anyone to refuse to leave
4437200 but the community does not want to accept them and the community says we wont allow them to come back
4437201 sensible people would go home i know its bad on the other side but sensible people would go home if youre not wanted in a society
4437202 they say that they were working on a plan and holding meetings to help us and that hasnt happened
4437203 they havent reintegrated us or helped us all theyve done is put me here on the street with my children the government has really treated me very badly here in south africa
4437204 she went and picked up our laundry and dipped it in muddy water

4437220 i want to say thank you to all the judges and people who came out and everyone who helped put this on
4437221 were really proud of her shes such a good girl
4437222 its fun and we like to go see all the other festivals
4437223 i loved traveling to all the different places some i didnt even know existed
4437224 work overtime for extra income for all the traveling and be patient
4437225 hes had a lot of fun representing coshocton county its been exciting to see him in parades and build his self esteem
4437226 its gotten his name out there and maybe encouraged people to come visit our community
4437227 i look at the way the costumes are made because we use things today they didnt have back then
4437228 they didnt have zippers and elastic and things like that
4437229 i love the innocence they have and the look on their faces whether they say anything or not
4437230 its more challenging to interview a 4 or 5 year old than any adult

4437234 a i can barely afford art materials b i dont like the media bombarding me with bullshit everywhere i go c i like to see the public react to my work
4437235 i dont want poster boy to be about one person theyre never signed unless you consider the flickr page my signature so that any piece can belong to anyone a lot of people say im a sucker for not trying to make money off poster boy but i still feel rewarded however id like to make a book of the best pieces from 08 who knows how well thatll turn out
4437236 we live in a big city of big boxes with little windows peeking onto other big boxes next to smaller ones and so on the shape the image i employ is new york i guess i feel like theres a certain sense of forgotten dimension a lot of overlooked layers so i create reminders and portals with the cubes adding to the urban landscape it just makes sense
4437237 though last week i had a couple cops pull up while i was doing a sidewalk piece saying they got calls about suspicious activity they made me take it off and said take it to the park i think it is regarded as marginal by both sides a kind of polite graffiti but ive heard of detainment for chalk graff so i dunno sometimes with these guys
4437238 there are the times where a scenario catches me a platform violinist a preaching panhandler a sleeping drunk honestly there are too many to do i think that goes for most street artists
4437239 i want to bring something new to street art or rather i want people to get something new from street art not just a sight seeing game but a physically intellectually and emotionally engaging opportunity i think i try to highlight the possibilities in my documentations at
4437240 theres a certain magic ive found about working in collaboration with the street environment making aesthetic decisions in the middle of a piece in the middle of the street
4437241 as a painter i had a lot of frustration with the hermetic formulaic life of paintings studio to storage the tape gives me a chance to let my art live i get to feel the effects of what it means to make art i dont have to have a relationship with a gallery to reach people i mean i think the tape as a medium has a ton of aspects that allow me to work differently freer in more places but ill never stop painting on canvas
4437242 i met poster boy a few years ago while i was in school we shared a creative imperative that art could and should be made anywhere and everywhere after we both broke out of the studio to make art we started planning a collaboration and we finally just got around to doing it i thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the results were planning the next session
4437243 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4437244 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers

4437248 the phthalate ban is only the tip of the iceberg of whats needed to protect americans from unsafe chemical exposures
4437249 public health advocates and parents were up against big oil and the chemical industry and we won this should serve as a wake up call to industry chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects have no place in consumer products
4437250 consumers are saying that the products we buy must be safe period the phthalate ban is a great start and an indication that congress is ready to consider the kind of sweeping chemical policy reform that is needed
4437251 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4437252 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4437253 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4437254 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4437255 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4437256 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4437257 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4437258 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4437259 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4437260 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4437261 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4437262 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4437263 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4437264 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4437265 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4437266 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4437267 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4437268 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4437269 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4437270 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4437271 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4437272 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4437273 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4437274 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4437275 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4437276 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4437277 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4437278 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4437279 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4437280 but when we cant do that we want to give physicians ways to determine precisely the cause or causes of your hypertension and optimal ways to target your disease

4437301 when i stayed with aunt krystal she didnt do that to me
4437302 i kindly reminded her i was her mother not my sister
4437303 i told him that we had an offer of 32 million euros 25m from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4437304 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4437305 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100 million he was very emphatic
4437306 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4437307 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as fifa president sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo
4437308 they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4437309 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer

4437339 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4437340 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4437341 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4437349 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4437350 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4437351 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4437352 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4437353 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4437354 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4437355 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4437356 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4437370 tidak ada tempat yang lebih buruk daripada perut manusia yang diisi penuh dengan makanan
4437371 malaikat jibril seringkali memberi wasiat kepada rasulullah untuk berbuat ihsan kepada tetangga saking seringnya rasulpun mengira mereka para tetangga akan mendapat warisan
4437372 sesungguhnya allah mewajibkan berbuat ihsan dalam segala sesuatu jika kamu membunuh hendaklah dengan cara yang ihsan jika kamu menyembelih hendaklah dilakukan dengan cara yang ihsan hendaklah menajamkan pisau dan menyenangkan hewan sembelihan itu
4437373 barangsiapa dapat mematikan cecak dengan sekali pukulan dia mendapat seratus kebaikan siapa yang mematikannya pada pukulan kedua maka dia mendapat sekian kebaikan lebih kecil dari yang pertama dan siapa yang membunuhnya pada pukulan ketiga maka baginya sekian kebaikan lebih kecil dari yang kedua

4437376 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4437377 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4437382 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4437383 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4437384 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4437385 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4437386 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4437387 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4437388 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4437389 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4437390 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery

4437398 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4437399 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4437400 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4437401 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4437402 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4437403 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4437404 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4437405 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4437406 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4437407 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4437408 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4437409 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4437410 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4437411 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4437412 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4437413 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4437414 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move

4437426 i was in springfield tuesday and stayed at the abraham lincoln hotel i went to the bar there and it was packed with legislators politicos not the usual state fair crowd one legislator who shall remain nameless was three sheets to the wind or my interpretation drunk as a skunk sitting on the floor they were bringing him glasses of water but he kept knocking them over he left for a few minutes but came back and went from table to table ending up at one table and started arguing with a state senator from up north everyone heard him shouting would you have accepted the pay raise or not to which the state senator replied equally as loud doesnt matter it was rescinded there was much arm waiving and more shouting and just when it looked like the fists would start flying some fellow legislators stepped in and broke it up

4437434 in the end it was just too entangled to get a good deal in place and so we had to close down it was really kind of a wrenching horrible period actually and we learned a lot from it wed do things differently next time for sure
4437435 we all were up all night every night not getting any sleep working every day trying to get it to work out for everyone and in the end it just didnt

4437461 the driver has buttons on the dashboard to control the hybrid drive
4437462 he can boost the power when coming out of corners or when someone is about to overtake
4437463 in the drive for efficiency i have always seen fuel cells and electric motors as good for flexibility and torque and i think they are appropriate for motorsport

4437477 i would expect them to put out information that people can rely upon
4437478 this has to be over and above what their plans are for the year they have to take their responsibilities seriously
4437479 im very interested in the idea as long as we find someone from the coast
4437480 people of the coast have to decide how to rebuild the coast
4437481 it should be someone whos here suffering with us who wakes up on the coast each day
4437482 whether its with the programming of money or the consideration for low income housing credit projects or the opportunity to take mississippi cottages and do something productive with them for people who are going to lose their homes or domiciles even being a motel come next march

4437490 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4437491 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4437492 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4437493 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4437494 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4437495 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4437496 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve

4437503 stands at the glorious midpoint at that difficult fulcrum between innocence and experience romance and disillusion adventure and satire the unashamedly commercial and the purely aesthetic between the stoned rangy funkiness of the seventies and the digitized cool of the present day between a time when outrage was a moral position and a time when it has become a way of life such balancing acts have always been the greatest feats of american popular art

4437541 it has a lower profile but it will be an issue in peoples minds the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism healthcare energy
4437542 the first thing that springs to mind with a draw like that are the travelling difficulties both for the team but in particular our supporters its a really tough draw in that sense and especially when you consider that we are in london on the saturday anyway for the orient game however from a football point of view and definitely from a player point of view its a cracking game our players can now put themselves up against a team that is expected to make it to the premier league next season so we can look forward to facing a challenge like that yes of course we would have preferred it to have been at home but well take the experience and see what we can use from it prior to the shrewsbury game we mentioned that we wanted to go through so that we could face another test in the second round and thats exactly what weve got
4437543 they are a side that are getting plenty of publicity both on and off the pitch
4437544 they have some high profile backing now and they genuinely expect to make that next step up i think its quite exciting for us to go up against a team like that i dont think many people will give us much of a chance but we dont mind that well be going down there to give it a go and we will be doing our best to get through to round three you never know we might actually get a home draw if we do
4437545 the first thing we did this morning was sit down and look at the logistics of it all
4437546 we are considering all of the options and i would imagine at this point that we will decide to travel back up after the orient game and then go down there again on the monday i think the lads would prefer to be back at home on the sunday and get a bit of rest and family time rather than stay down there but well see
4437547 our intention is still to go ahead with the open training session on the monday after the orient game as we had arranged
4437548 thats something that we are very keen to do with the fans but obviously we do have to see where we are once we have finalised our qpr travelling details
4437549 what is very common now is to see people struggling to buy food because of the high prices of staples like rice and bread

4437582 this was about them deferring some standard maintenance and continuing to fly the aircraft
4437583 this potentially could have compromised the safety of passengers and the crew
4437584 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans actions in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
4437585 they can present their case but in our view this is an appropriate amount especially considering they knowingly flew these planes with passengers aboard
4437586 from those hearings the suggestion was that there was far too cozy a relationship between the faa and the airlines inspection management
4437587 they seem to have taken more of a hard line approach and are not as willing to negotiate down the fines
4437588 this is just a big splash to make it look like theyre being tough with the airlines
4437589 this is like fining a lexus dealer for not changing the oil these are regulatory violations more than anything and as far as the public being endangered absolutely not what theyre arguing about is whether these planes could only fly under certain conditions
4437590 it got really bad around last year with gangs and drugs
4437591 all this time i assumed these people were here legitimately
4437592 weve had a lot of violent shootings and violent activities in this area
4437593 were looking at one sweep to make the neighborhood better
4437594 when youre calling people wetbacks and spics youre going to lose control
4437595 no one is going to follow orders when theyre being demeaned like that
4437596 as an organization we take it quite seriously weve spent a lot of time looking into it
4437597 i feel that its possible that the fans at the time were inebriated
4437598 when people are drunk things can get out of hand and things can get crazy
4437599 if there was any evidence of discrimination and racism the employee would be fired
4437600 a lot of people are sickened by sector latinos treatment

4437607 i first saw him quite a few years ago when he was playing for brondby and he caught the eye then
4437608 hes a goalkeeper that has been on our radar all summer
4437609 jeromes a young player that harry has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4437610 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself
4437611 we have two and a half weeks to go until the transfer window closes weve been monitoring quite a lot of players and its vitally important that we do try and add some new players
4437612 we have lost two players and its important we try to fill their places
4437613 weve brought in paul robinson but we hope to continue signing some more players in the next two and a half weeks
4437614 every player brings different challenges and i will get on with my job as captain as normal he is bubbly everyone knows what he is about sometimes he gets himself into trouble or others create it for him but im sure he will be fine
4437615 people will know what diouf is all about and we will have to look after him and help him to try to make sure he does not get himself into trouble because referees will be after him they target certain players
4437616 its part of my job and other players to make sure he doesnt react in a bad way
4437617 the conduct of the brigade involved was exemplary throughout its tour typifying the professionalism bravery and swiftness of action that defines our armed forces
4437618 but that does not mean that we should not learn lessons from the tragic loss of l cpl mathew ford
4437619 worry not youre not alone in your complaint and the bbc are going to rectify it too
4437620 for digital viewers the whole ceremony was available via the red button all night along with a 90 minute edited version and there was also extensive coverage on the bbc website in addition the four hour ceremony was featured on bbc iplayer for seven days after transmission
4437621 im very excited to be here and it is a dream to play for such a big club in the premier league
4437622 i have known about newcastles interest for a while and i wanted to sign because it is a club i know all about from my time watching english football in spain and argentina
4437623 im a defender who will always try my best for the team
4437624 i think i am a good technical player and i will be suited to the speed and physical side of the game in england
4437625 scolari is prepared for this challenge during the past few weeks i have seen him show a lot of spirit and hunger to succeed
4437626 arriving in a new country is always complicated but i have no doubt he will be a success in the premier league he only needs a little time to adapt to what is going on scolaris position at chelsea was crucial to my decision to join the club
4437627 he explained his plans to me and then i decided it was the best option for me as i left barca
4437628 now i cant wait for the season to start and get on with winning silverware
4437629 we are not looking for massive changes among the squad weve done that within the last 12 months
4437630 if you look at the players weve brought in its been virtually every position plus the emergence of one or two players from the academy and we believe this is a very good squad
4437631 if we go into this season with this group after august 31 we will not be unhappy
4437632 we have not had a single offer for jon if stoke are serious about jon then they should make an offer if not then they should go away
4437633 it annoys me he is an ipswich town footballer on a three year deal we dont want to sell him we want to keep him if stoke are showing serious intent in getting jon then they should do something about it if not they should leave alone and let us get on with it
4437634 i want hull city to be in the top flight for a number of years not just one
4437635 the realisation of dreams and all of those words that people come out with will all be there tomorrow
4437636 but managing in the premier league is something ive always striven for as an individual and ive got there now
4437637 personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4437638 hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better
4437639 weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on
4437640 i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season
4437641 my wife says i treat them better than i treat her

4437658 denn die markenhersteller werden so marktanteilsverluste gegen ber billiganbietern und handelsmarken ausgleichen wollen andererseits kann es wie erfolgsbeispiele zeigen durch eine ver nderte preiskommunikation oder neue preismodelle gelingen ohne reale preissenkungen dem trend zu folgen
4437659 im detail muss jedoch beachtet werden dass die verbraucher auch weiterhin qualit tsvergleiche anstellen
4437660 daraus folgt dass die verbraucher zum beispiel bei als mangelhaft wahrgenommener qualit t nicht unbedingt zu discountern wechseln sondern eventuell ganz auf den kauf verzichten oder diesen zeitlich verschieben

4437667 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh

4437671 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face

4437691 zenit have decided to reduce the asking price for andrei but exactly how much i cannot say because the negotiations were led by zenit president alexander dyukov
4437692 hes very strong and athletic and he has important experience at the top level we can call upon
4437693 this has been the plan after ascot but i am concerned about the ground hes been very effective on fast ground ive never run him on soft ground although he has run on very soft ground in france
4437694 its a concern but its probably not going to put us off obviously if it got bottomless with the rain coming in tomorrow we might have a rethink but at the moment we are intending to run
4437695 this is dropping back a little bit in trip but ive been keen to give him a shot at it for some time and well see how he gets on
4437696 if my horse isnt as good at this trip we can go back up for the doncaster cup
4437697 weve not got a lot to lose by having a little go and hes seven its not like we got some big long term plan hes there for everyone to enjoy
4437698 newbury should suit him well as will the trip but i am just hoping that it wont be really soft ground
4437699 hell be absolutely fine on good to soft but i hope that the wet weather clears up so we are not running in a bog
4437700 eastern anthem is pleasing me and has come out of his last race very well
4437701 he won nicely at newmarket and deserves to contest this group three
4437702 at headingley he bowled quite well and didnt let himself down at all perhaps there were a few nerves on day one as you might expect from a man making his test debut but on day two he was probably englands best bowler
4437703 hes been doing well since he was left out and his performances would certainly merit the selectors taking another look at him
4437704 we didnt really know anything about pattinson but we made a few phone calls to some of our contacts on the county circuit and got some information from them pretty quickly
4437705 when it came to our first innings we all studied him closely to find out what his bowling was like
4437706 at the time we felt he had bowled quite steadily and then after the match we noticed how much stick he had been getting
4437707 most of it was a bit harsh and im sure that if england had won the test it wouldnt have been an issue at all
4437708 he didnt ask to be selected and every player wants to represent their country he was hardly going to turn them down
4437709 its the goal of the team to be number one in the world in both forms of the game
4437710 before they returned to demo songs for the follow up to 2006s
4437711 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense
4437712 the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling
4437713 its just kind of like another outside of the bubble song for atreyu on lead sails paper anchor which i think the whole record is kind of outside of our bubble another weird song that we wrote and we play we dont even play it that well
4437714 we are excited change things up this time and work with josh weve never stayed in one place too long and the evolution continues there is an aggressive shift in the material and our approach the bar has been raised

4437738 we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement which is also good for the czech republic and nato
4437739 it would have happened even without the events in georgia

4437755 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4437756 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4437757 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place

4437766 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4437767 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4437768 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4437769 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4437770 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river

4437787 continued failure by u s tax policymakers to keep up with our top global economic competitors means that were solidifying a trend that will result in our children and grandchildren not seeing the economic growth weve seen in our lifetimes
4437788 theres a real wallet impact for americans as we continue to sit idly by while other countries improve the way they do business and we should be very concerned about jobs capital and investments moving from high tax countries to low tax countries
4437789 meeting all these conflicting demands is a very tall order

4437804 as we continue to grow and expand into canada we remain focused on the security of our system and with our customers ability to comply with applicable privacy regulations a number of clients in the canadian market have already taken advantage of our new data center to ensure that their security and privacy needs are met

4437807 thats pretty cool to see the company youre keeping especially when we really dont consider ourselves a big band not an arena band or a stadium band
4437808 the stages get bigger but we always stay the same distance apart from each other especially at glastonbury the stage is so huge and other bands take full advantage and fill up every inch that they can but we all like to stay in our little bubble our little comfort zone

4437813 one of the awards staff asked zac who the straighteners were for and he said vanessa hudgens but it was really for him
4437814 he said the humidity was killing his hair and that it was flat
4437815 i teased him too though especially for having been a model

4437831 feelings about romney do run deep and the choice of romney as a vp would not activate us

4437834 ive had meetings with the big three and they are confident with the new hybrids flex fuel vehicles and other technological advances that they will succeed
4437835 i worry about us predicting failure on the part of automakers when theyve made strides on things like labor agreements

4437841 so i phone these guys to get my hours sorted and he says i have to talk to my employer even though im contracted to them they didnt track any of it
4437842 and the guy i was talking to was such a cocksucker he may actually be one for all i know
4437843 uh not that it would have any bearing on anything

4437861 this was the first painting i did in this studio
4437862 i was really excited about working in this great new light and i wanted to create an honest image of myself in the studio
4437863 the most important aspect of a self portrait or any portrait for that matter is to make the piece a compelling painting on its own regardless of who the subject is
4437864 ive noticed in looking at other artists self portraits both by todays artists and by the masters of the past that the self portrait usually becomes more honest as the artist grows older
4437865 many young artists when they are starting out including myself have used themselves as models out of convenience as a student you are focused on learning and mastering your craft studying the anatomy and facial expressions and experimenting with new styles and not so much about exploring your own persona
4437866 this is a painting i did after being reminded daily by insurance companies of my impending official senior status
4437867 since im not interested in creating a flattering image often a requirement of commissioned portraiture i am free to experiment with technique and or message with no time constraints there are unlimited possibilities
4437868 the role of the self portrait is to present an unbiased reproduction of the self
4437869 it becomes a short biography that illuminates the passion and dedication of an artist by vulnerably and humbly placing one in his or her own creation
4437870 i want to recreate moments of light and color that present the inner light that is within all nature
4437871 if i had pots of money id have a huge collection of self portraits
4437872 they bring to light the most fascinating and accurate insights into artists psyches and techniques
4437873 i always start with a self portrait in those situations
4437874 that way the subject matter doesnt get in the way of trying to master the techniques my wife also claims that i am appallingly and unjustifiably self absorbed
4437875 when i painted this piece i had been studying at studio incamminati for about three years
4437876 this painting represented one of the first opportunities for me to develop a figure painting beyond a study and to use all the tools i had learned thus far i had this idea in my mind of myself as a young cocky painter this was the concept i wanted the self portrait to convey
4437877 as in all my work im interested in painting the subject in space
4437878 the air and atmosphere of the room or landscape are always of great importance
4437879 my primary goal as with all of my work was to make a visually beautiful image something that is food for the eyes and soul
4437880 then there is the goal of faithfully rendering the subject matter in this instance myself
4437881 down from the loftiest star a splendor falls on earth and draws desire afar to that which gave it birth the old fashioned medium of egg tempera itself all express my inclinations and temperament they are the things that i value and love most in my world
4437882 this drawing is obviously a visual depiction of the incident but whats more this piece is meant to convey the dialogue that occurs between an artist and his or her work while drawing or painting through tough times
4437883 i spent countless hours on this self portrait doing just that i was drawing while simultaneously living in a broken state this self portrait may be no more than a drawing for some but for me and hopefully for at least a few others it reflects an arduous and frustrating healing process this underlying reflection was my ultimate goal hopefully the months of struggle and emotion show through the finished image like rings on a tree trunk the ideas that i meant to convey lay within the act of drawing and are not carefully placed hints within structural elements such as the background or a carefully interpreted composition they are instead evoked with more subtlety when the time invested and the act of drawing itself show through the formal elements of traditional portraiture
4437884 there are a ton of obstacles that representational artists have to overcome in order to find a place in todays world
4437885 to me the hardest obstacle to overcome is finding the ability to take something people are completely used to that has been seen and done over and over again and pull it out of its original context in history or in nature and put it into the context of a current piece of art thereby making it personal and unique an artist has to cross over the barrier that an ordinary person may have in his or her relationship with nature to do so the more familiar artists are with their subject the easier it is to take what they want from it and leave the rest out there is nothing more familiar to any person than oneself by using oneself as a subject an artist can cross barriers with unusual ease without the need to focus on crossing barriers and overcoming difficulties within a subject a self portrait has the potential to convey an idea in a way that other subjects may never be able to self portraits are still portraits but they can be used to really convey a personal idea and become much more than an interesting drawing or painting
4437886 self portraits are a very important part of any portrait artists life
4437887 it can be an essential tool that helps an artist balance his subjective nature and objective observations its a good opportunity to give the viewer a great deal of insight as self portraits may be one of the most subjective efforts an artist can explore

4437926 we think a great deal of this problem comes from the political influence of the food industry and a persistent disregard of consumer safety in favor of profits as far as were concerned its time the public were made well aware of the chemicals at play in the grocery products they buy to enable them to make better food choices for a healthier lifestyle and to beat the very conditions theyre trying to avoid

4437933 when visiting an lccs website customers may not be surprised to find a convenient way to save money on their electricity bills it adds credence to the notion that the lcc is going the extra mile to save customers money american and other traditional carriers have been around long enough to serve three generations of customers and are just beginning to serve the fourth there is no need to reach beyond the scope of travel related services in order to make a name for ourselves it makes sense for us to stay focused on offering products that enrich the customers travel experience

4437937 i draw two conclusions from this airlines have a natural advantage in selling non air components and the other 25 percent of travel purchasers should not be expected to suffer through an air booking path before finding non air options
4437938 for the 75 percent of customers that like to purchase air first my bias is to get them through the booking path as quickly as possible and then offer the most relevant non air options at the confirmation step or between booking and travel however i wouldnt rule out the possibility that some ancillary products when placed correctly within the booking path could actually improve air conversions the key in that respect is to test a few different selling strategies and track the results
4437939 the other 25 percent of customers are more likely to be package purchasers that require a bit more inspiration and research before ultimately deciding to purchase they need a different booking experience that is more akin to what a travel agency would provide before investing in a separate booking product an airline needs to decide whether it has enough customers that expect it to serve this type of inspirational role if the volume isnt there then a partnering approach is probably more appropriate

4437945 as long as im not the person in the bed i dont have a right to complain
4437946 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
4437947 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
4437948 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
4437949 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
4437950 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
4437951 the students involved become well acquainted with the preamble from this process this was a very moving experience for all the children really thought through what they value and how they want to see those values shared by others in the world this summoned respect and awe in the audience
4437952 when content is transmitted through song and movement it is much easier to remember making learning fun increases the childrens interest and thereby their capacity to learn
4437953 when i ask children what they most remember in previous school years they never say the homework or the written work they always say the performances productions puppet theater and we use the talking hands talking feet curriculum based performing arts program because we want a professional result
4437954 we have seen tremendous enthusiasm in children working with this approach they have a chance to make it their own to be it to live it rather than to just talk about it separate from themselves children want to engage in life and have a chance to put their own creativity in the process what we are doing is giving them confidence to create express and to learn in a deep and thorough way
4437955 consumer businesses everywhere are seeing a slowdown in sales the ordinary man or woman no longer has access to the same resources as before and naturally competition for sales is hotting up as a response to this seismic economic shift its becoming more important than ever before to differentiate and reach out to different demographics
4437956 one of the most cost effective ways for consumer businesses to reach out into new markets is through gpt offers by creating competitive offers with appropriate incentives savvy businesses can utilise the full impact of gpt marketing campaigns to their advantage and bring in a raft of new customers as a result
4437957 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4437958 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4437959 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4437960 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4437961 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4437962 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4437963 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4437964 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4437965 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition
4437966 my brother is getting ready to take his entire family to orlando for a vacation
4437967 and ive tried to convince him that he should vacation closer to home and use that money to make some investments in five or 10 years nothing will be left of that 4 000 vacation other than some photos but using that money for investments now will leave him with 20 000 or even 30 000 in the bank down the road
4437968 we are very pleased that the west virginia state police is so satisfied with the performance of our dvm 500 in car video rearview mirror systems that the agency has placed its largest order to date with our company
4437969 while the cumulative total of 516 units ordered by the west virginia state police represents the largest number of dvm 500 systems ordered by a single law enforcement agency in the united states the number of our customers that have placed multiple follow on orders after gaining field experience with their initial dvm 500s continues to expand
4437970 while this order from an international customer totals only 25 units it illustrates that law enforcement agencies are moving beyond the testing phase and into the deployment of the dvf 500 within their organizations
4437971 we have always expected that broad acceptance of the dvf 500 digital video flashlight would take more time than was the case with our dvm 500 in car video systems because we are defining and serving a market that did not exist prior to the introduction of our product on the other hand the dvf 500 provides law enforcement officers with much greater flexibility in the documentation of criminal activities regardless of their location and we believe the long range market potential for digital video flashlights will be substantial
4437972 for the candidates this is their opportunity to address the national convention of americas oldest major veterans organization and the nations largest organization of combat veterans
4437973 what the vfw membership wants to know is how each candidate would prosecute the war on terrorism and protect america through strong national defense and homeland security programs we also want to know how they would enhance military and veteran healthcare programs benefits and quality of life initiatives
4437974 including 2 2 million military service personnel and all of our spouses and adult age children brings the nations veteran family to well over 50 million americans
4437975 a fifth of the nations adult population is a voting bloc that absolutely cannot be ignored by any politician at any level regardless of political party

4437994 julians a quality goalkeeper and to work with that everyday can only improve me
4437995 i told calderon we have a proposal of 25 4 million from chelsea and that robinho wants to leave
4437996 robinho said there is no point being unhappy and unproductive at the club
4437997 but calderon said he would not sell even for 100 million i left the meeting thinking that was that but after talking to other leaders of the club i saw that this position might change
4437998 robinho told calderon he was treating him the same as fifa president sepp blatter had said manchester united were doing with cristiano ronaldo
4437999 newcastle have given us permission to talk to the lad and we have been in contact with his agent
4438000 charlie woods and sir bobby know shola chapter and verse and i will talk to them about him
4438001 we are not prepared to comment on the fee involved lets just say they have met our asking price
4438002 we regard this as a good deal for a player who could have left on a free transfer in 16 days time
4438003 the transfer window closes on august 31 and no one would have paid any money for glenn after that
4438004 i was never going to throw money around particularly when i was learning the job myself its bloody impossible to balance the books at a football club
4438005 we knew that and its as close to being balanced as possible while trying to fulfil ambitions and move forward
4438006 we signed three first class players in january and four first class players in the close season
4438007 its too easy to write big cheques on big names if they dont deliver then the moans will start and ill be doing most of them

4438010 were doing our best but we might have to be patient
4438011 one of my competitors walking out said it reminded her of melbourne for the commonwealth games so there you go
4438012 i would suggest that in the long endurance outdoor sports you can see an impact these athletes are talking about seconds apart long term exposure in these conditions it can certainly take seconds off
4438013 i was expecting the worst and we put measures in place if it was necessary but it hasnt been an issue not since ive been here
4438014 its visible you can see it but it doesnt bother me
4438015 we were all going to be in the same situation so it doesnt matter at all
4438016 i deserve the medal because ive trained for 14 years
4438017 i was looking forward to winning gold at the olympics but it was just not to be
4438018 i think the beijing games will be my last olympics truthfully i really dont know what else to say

4438042 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
4438043 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
4438044 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
4438045 the divine name at qumran in the masada scroll and in the septuagint

4438099 the democrats with the help of their friends in the media will now use the pennsylvania pro abortion senator to sell the message that they have gotten beyond their anti catholic reputation that reputation which was played out in 1992 by delegates who wore anti papal buttons at the convention still sticks if they are serious about reaching out to catholics and jettisoning their anti catholic baggage once and for all they can allow a prominent catholic to speak in denver who is truly pro life that should be an easy choice to make given the small pool of eligible candidates

4438106 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds

4438108 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff

4438130 we knew that if we were going to do something again it had to be something big and emotional i played this very clever cat and mouse game to get my husband and then my best friend involved
4438131 it still amazes me that people actually watching me with a gun didnt just burst out laughing
4438132 i cant even play ping pong but it turns out im good with weapons ive got enormous hands like a transsexual and thats probably why
4438133 most employers take every opportunity they can to judge staff and employees can be overlooked for promotions if they dont present themselves accordingly
4438134 employees are just far too lax in their opinions of business casual and there is a want for clarification of this term
4438135 it does not mean sloppy nor even in some cases relaxed and the same image of professionalism needs to remain at all times
4438136 if i was going to go gay for another actress it would have to be cate blanchett absolutely
4438137 we could talk about the theatre and she has played a guy really well so if i got bored thatd be nice
4438138 my friend and i went in for lunch last week with our two 3 year olds all the tables at the restaurant were empty except for one other couple with a child at a corner table no customers were waiting to be seated ahead of us the entrance to the place is quite narrow with a service counter and stools there were one or two people eating at the counter as well as some service people getting a large delivery ready i ushered the 2 toddlers towards the empty restaurant in order to get them out of the busy entrance they sat quietly at a table as we waited for our table and high chairs to be set up at this point the owner chef notices us and states he will be with us in a moment and asks that we wait for him to he sets up our table i said no problem i just wanted the kids out of the way until we were set up he says again no you have to wait you cannot sit there i looked at him kind of incredulously and turned to the kids and said ok we need to go back to the front door and wait now at this point he got very hostile and said quite loudly what is this the first time youve had to wait to be seated in a restaurant i looked at him with an ironic smile and said i guess you dont have kids well this guy exploded on me seriously he looked at me and the two kids who are still quiet as mice btw and said ok you can leave now get out he actually kicked me my friend and our 2 kids out of his restaurant because i dared to sit quietly in the corner with 2 kids and not stand at the door even after my friend told him that she lives up the block and eats at his restaurant all the time and is just not beleiving this he was adamant and of course we left i was sooo shocked this guy was seriously over the top hostile and scared our kids just thought this may be of interest perhaps to advise your readers that this is not a very kid friendly place despite the presence of high chairs and the casual atmosphere
4438139 these store owners dont seem to understand that we are special and the rules dont apply to us we have money and children
4438140 what everyone seems to not notice or merely forget is that the children arent the problem in this town its the parents
4438141 what everyone seems to not notice or merely forget is that the children arent the problem in this town its the parents
4438142 i love people who dont have children who tell you how to parent
4438143 id love for him to be responsible for three children for the next year and see if he can control the volume of their voices every minute of the day
4438144 part of parenting skills is teaching kids they behave differently in a restaurant than they do on the playground

4438166 contrary to the claims of free trade critics the trade deficit tells us almost nothing about the success or failure of u s trade policy the deficit reflects the continuing inflow of foreign investment to the u s economy without that investment millions of homeowners and businesses would be saddled with higher interest payments its ironic to hear democrats complain about the trade deficit under president clinton in the 1990s the trade deficit exploded from 70 billion to 380 billion and by all accounts the american economy performed well

4438168 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4438169 it just didnt feel right he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
4438170 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4438171 so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4438172 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time
4438173 theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera
4438174 all am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4438175 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye

4438183 the price adjustment is necessary to help ease pressure on companies production and business activities as well as peoples lives
4438184 purchasing power at our station has dropped about 20 per cent since last months petrol price hikes of 30 per cent
4438185 its good news but the price adjustment is not very significant
4438186 a cut of vnd2 000 3 000 would excite people more
4438187 petrol prices were raised to vnd19 000 per litre when the world oil price reached 135 a barrel now that oil is around 115 a barrel a cut of vnd1 000 is not enough
4438188 but i wonder when or if prices of other commodities will drop the prices of goods remain high despite petrol price declines
4438189 the way i look at it any price cut is good
4438190 a drop of vnd1 000 per litre is not significant to each individual but means quite a lot to society at large in the context of the governments efforts to curb inflation
4438191 the adjustment is good for augusts consumer price index cpi
4438192 i believe prices in the general market will go down particularly transportation costs
4438193 if world oil prices continue to fall we will consider reasonable adjustments in domestic prices
4438194 but i must stress that the domestic petrol price is not simply based on world oil prices but on many factors controlling inflation being of top priority
4438195 the matter is how to raise capital sources especially when the government still has to compensate large sums to petrol dealers
4438196 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4438197 literally in the process of working out a self surrender
4438198 market liquidity has improved considerably recently as more people are flocking to the market
4438199 inflation ratio fdi and interest rates have been improving the first signs of success that the government is stabilising the market
4438200 all of these factors will help spur trading the trading bands opening will give investors options in buying and selling which will lead to better market liquidity in this context
4438201 the hastc could begin the operation of the controlled over the counter market otc in the end of third quarter which has a trading band of 10 per cent if both of the listed and unlisted shares are traded within 10 per cent plus or minus misunderstandings could easily occur during the counts

4438204 you will think you are in zimbabwe if you go into some supermarkets in zambia mozambique or namibia
4438205 but the latest moves by the government to lift import duty and suspension of exports on basic goods should go some way in making these goods available in local markets at reasonable prices
4438206 it is a noble idea since it address the issue of the availability of basic commodities individuals who can afford can now import the goods as opposed to buying them on the black market at exorbitant prices

4438263 die b uerliche landwirtschaft mu wirtschaftlich effizient sein sie mu gemessen an den eingesetzten produktionsmitteln und im hinblick auf die produzierten mengen eine hohe wertsch pfung aufweisen nur unter dieser bedingung k nnen die bauern mit relativ bescheidenen produktionsmengen zurechtkommen und nur unter dieser bedingung kann die landwirtschaft eine gro e anzahl von arbeitskr ften besch ftigen eine in dieser form effiziente produktion ist voraussetzung f r die produktion von qualit t
4438264 sie denken selber in den katagorien der ware und wollen sich gar keine vorstellung ber eine welt jenseits davon machen was dann als vermeintliche kritik einer welt der waren brig bleibt ist nichts als eine verk rzte und nebelhafte denunziation von subjektiver profitgier und geldgeilheit das geld ist aber nur die erscheinungsform der universellen warenproduktion nicht deren wesen das in abstrakter arbeit und wertform gr ndet

4438267 unser zweites lamm berhaupt das bei uns geboren wurde zwillingsm dchen das nachdem der bruder gelandet war mit einem fuss zurueck feststeckte aber damals schon in der position mit kopf draussen laut gemaeht hat kann das sein
4438268 wenn ich meine schafe kraule grunzen einige wonniglich vor sich hin h rt sich an als ob sie schnarchen
4438269 und bei den schafen haben wir eins dabei vermutlich fr her ein flaschenlamm sie sucht die n he der menschen und wenn man zu den schafen geht und sich hinkniet legt sie einem den kopf auf die schulter und schl ft ein
4438270 ein bocklamm von m rz 05 ist von anfang an immer auf unsere h teh ndin zugelaufen wenn sie auf die weide kam das b ckchen hat ihr immer die schnauze geleckt wie es ein welpe bei erwachsenen hunden tut unsere h ndin hat ihn daraufhin auch wie einen welpen behandelt mittlerweile muss er nun doch schon mal mit der herde mitgehen wenn sie treibt und darf nicht mehr hinter hund und herde herlatschen aber an der begr ssung hat sich nichts ver ndert er war im gegensatz zu seinem bruder und vater allerdings noch nie agressiv gegen den hund bei unserer anderen h ndin kommen solche vertraulichkeiten aber gar nicht gut an ist ihr wahrscheinlich peinlich von nem schaf geknutscht zu werden

4438274 es gab sicherlich unterschiedliche gr nde auf den finkhof zu kommen z b das interesse an gesellschaftlicher ver nderung und der wunsch mit dem damaligen theoretischen hintergrund etwas ganz neues selber zu schaffen man fand sich auf der basis des gemeinsamen betriebes und der gemeinsamen konomie wieder finkhoffilme zeigen j ngere menschen gemeinsam beim wolle waschen heu machen und tiefsch rfende diskussionen f hrend praktikantinnen probezeitlerinnen oder besucherinnen waren an der weife ein ger t das mit muskelkraft 25 wollstr nge auf einmal aufwickeln konnte gut aufgehoben kurbelnderweise kamen finkh fler und neulinge sich n her erste bereinstimmungen und unterschiede wurden festgestellt diskussionsstoff gab es damals reichlich die arbeitsrotation wurde schnell abgel st durch die aufteilung in arbeitsbereiche in denen man sich aushalf sp ter wurden auf dem plenum kneipendienste wolltouren und k chendienste verteilt durchaus in manchmal z hen verhandlungen nat rlich sind wir nicht dort stehen geblieben arbeitsbereiche wurden aufgemacht und wieder geschlossen relativ schnell wurde klar dass der homo collectivus nicht automatisch ein allroundgenie ist die ersten jahre waren gepr gt von versuch und irrtum viel gezahltem lehrgeld aber auch von der lust am entwickeln und aufbauen immerhin haben sich die meisten von uns ihre t tigkeiten selber beigebracht vom volkswirt zum sch fer von der bibliothekarin zur f rberin von der weberin zur kataloggestalterin vom sch fer zum versandler um nur einige karrieren zu nennen jeder fand sich im laufe der zeit auf dem platz wieder der seinen neigungen und f higkeiten entsprach nderten sich die neigungen konnte der arbeitsplatz gewechselt und neue f higkeiten entwickelt werden grundprinzip war immer leben und arbeit als einheit zu sehen f r arbeitsbereiche die uns wichtig waren stellten wir die ersten mitarbeiter an das war ein schritt dem langwierige und sehr emotionsgeladene diskussionen vorausgegangen waren unser arbeitsleben nderte sich wir mussten mehr planen mehr organisieren der anfangsschwierigkeiten gab es viele heute sind wir zehn finkh fler denen der betrieb geh rt und je nach jahreszeit bis zu 15 angestellte dazu kommen noch praktikantinnen und zwei auszubildende mitarbeiter die nicht mit uns leben sind aus unserem betrieb nicht mehr wegzudenken ohne sie w ren wir nicht da wo wir jetzt sind unsere arbeitsbereiche sind weitgehend autonom organisiert und treffen eigenst ndige entscheidungen nur manchmal wird beim abendessen entschieden welche farbe die neue bettw sche f r den katalog haben soll wir leben aus der bed rfniskasse unsere angestellten bekommen einen einheitslohn wir sind weit davon entfernt kollektiv wolle zu spinnen und gemeinsam socken zu stricken die arbeitsteilung hat mit moderner technologie und sehr umfangreichen spezialkenntnissen einzelner bei uns einzug gehalten diese finden aber auf wunderbare weise immer wieder eingang in unser aller wissen also alles wie im richtigen leben ja und nein wir unterliegen betrieblichen sachzw ngen zum beispiel ist jedem von uns klar dass er von oktober bis januar w hrend der hauptgesch ftszeit nicht in urlaub fahren kann jede r hat arbeiten die er nicht so gerne macht und wie berall wo sich mehr als ein mensch aufh lt gibt es unterschiedliche ansichten und konflikte ziehen sich auch durch unser arbeitsleben mancher arbeitsbereichswechsel oder schmerzlicher weggang hatte als ursache pers nliche konflikte die nicht zu l sen waren wir gestalten den betrieb gemeinsam dadurch haben wir ein hohes ma an individuellen freir umen die jeder nach seinen bed rfnissen ausf llt und nicht zu vergessen durch die art unseres betriebes und durch unsere gemeinsame geschichte die vertrauen geschaffen hat sind wir in der lage auf ver nderte lebenssituationen zu reagieren hierf r ein beispiel wir kommen in das alter in dem wir uns um unsere eltern in der einen oder anderen form k mmern weil sie alt oder pflegebed rftig werden das braucht zeit da kann es schon mal sein dass man einen tag in der woche nicht da ist oder einen monat ausf llt oder mit dieser problematik so besch ftigt ist dass andere dinge hinten anstehen m ssen dieser notwendigkeit k nnen wir raum und zeit geben weil wir solche ver nderungen nicht nur menschlich sondern auch betrieblich auffangen k nnen am anfang war es vielleicht ein spiel aber wir haben uns mit diesem betrieb etwas ganz besonderes geschaffen n mlich die m glichkeit unser arbeitsleben nach unseren pers nlichkeiten auszurichten und nicht umgekehrt
4438275 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4438276 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4438277 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4438278 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance to catch liukin
4438279 at that point i didn t really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4438280 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4438281 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4438282 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4438283 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4438284 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4438285 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4438286 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4438287 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers
4438288 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough

4438293 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4438294 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4438295 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4438296 el colmo de la desfachatez que el consejero de industria culpabilice a los tribunales de que canarias este a la cola de las comunidades aut nomas en potencia e lica instalada porque la sentencia es la consecuencia y la causa es una mala pol tica de muchos a os que siempre acaba en los tribunales como terminar ste en materia e lica la sentencia es la consecuencia la causa por la que se dict mejor ni recordarla
4438297 la excusa del volumen de los proyectos deja en evidencia la incompetencia de este consejero porque si seguimos su razonamiento debemos decir que en educaci n hay un mayor volumen de matriculaci n de alumnos en un mes determinado por ejemplo y no por eso se dejan de cumplir las leyes es como si hacienda le dijera que ante la cantidad de declaraciones de la renta a devolver la suya debe esperar a os el retraso es pura incompetencia e ineficacia del gobierno que venimos sufriendo los ciudadanos y que para nada tiene que ver con la transparencia y s con el incumplimiento de las leyes

4438302 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammed as a hostage i have no problems with islam but with the terrorists
4438303 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologize we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark

4438307 they intercept at many junctures in our lives and help wherever they can to make our lives run smoothly sometimes this is by inspiring a thought to spur us into action at others it is to lend us super human strength such as in the case of a woman being able to lift a car long enough to free her trapped child or we hear of a runaway truck with an unconscious driver at the wheel inexplicably swerving sharply at the last moment to avoid a bus stop queue of people in fact there are many instances which are often put down to luck coincidence or even a miracle but which have the touch of a hand of light behind it

4438508 de voedselsituatie was slecht en dat heeft mijn gezondheid aangetast bijna alle kinderen leden aan dysenterie en andere aandoeningen door kalkgebrek brak ik na de bevrijding mijn arm op mijn 23e werd ik al aan een hernia geopereerd later volgde opnieuw een rugoperatie mn hele leven ben ik moe geweest toen ik lerares kinderopvoeding en verzorging werd die keuze zal ook uit mijn jeugdervaringen zijn voortgekomen vroeg ik om in mijn lesrooster een rustpauze in te lassen in het kamp kregen we een strenge zindelijkheidstraining na de oorlog begonnen mijn zusjes allemaal weer in bed te plassen tot mijn dertiende jaar zoog ik op mijn vingers en rollebolde ik met mijn hoofd als ik in bed lag uitingen van een gevoel van onveiligheid
4438509 toen we naar het schip gingen waarmee we indi verlieten moesten we onder matrassen gaan liggen als bescherming tegen kogels van nationalisten
4438510 opeens zat er een man met een baard naast het bed van mijn moeder is die vreemde meneer mijn papa vroeg ik
4438511 aan boord werden veel vaderlandse liederen gezongen soms lag het schip stil dan ging er een lichaam overboord de haaien zwommen rond het schip vele jaren later was ik eens in de middellandse zee aan het zwemmen opeens drong zich de angst aan me op haaien ik ben zo hard mogelijk teruggezwommen en dat terwijl er geen haai te zien was
4438512 vader en moeder moeten vrolijke mensen geweest zijn maar na de oorlog waren ze veranderd moeder was een koele vrouw geworden vader een moeilijke man dat be nvloedde hun huwelijk en de verhouding met de kinderen ze spraken vaak over scheiding maar zijn toch bij elkaar gebleven zelf was ik een moeilijk kind dat geen onrechtvaardigheid kon verdragen dat leidde tot botsingen met mijn ouders vader moet aan de birmaspoorlijn gewerkt hebben en uit krijgsgevangenschap ontsnapt zijn aan een pak rammel door een japanner hield hij een scheve mond over op school vertelde hij soms over zijn indi tijd dat hoorde ik dan van andere leerlingen thuis sprak hij er echter niet over als het over de jappen ging werd hij furieus de lijfstraffen die hij ons soms gaf moet hij haast wel uit het kamp hebben overgenomen de oorlog heeft hem psychisch verwond hij kon er niet mee omgaan als een van de kinderen meer eten op zijn bord kreeg dan hij op de bakkersvakschool in amsterdam waren zijn leerlingen hem soms bijna de baas dan kwam de oude angst voor de japanners weer boven
4438513 ook al was ik nog maar vijf jaar toen we uit indi weggingen toch verlangde ik altijd naar dat land de bergen de kleuren de warmte de zangerige tonen zodra ik er na mijn echtscheiding het geld voor had heb ik een reis naar indonesi gemaakt als lerares vertelde ik vaak over indi ik heb er planken vol boeken over en eet ook graag indisch achteraf zag ik hoe mijn kinderjaren me hebben be nvloed toen mijn twee zoons geboren werden was mijn eerste gedachte dat is kanonnenvlees nog zoiets mijn provisiekast was altijd overvol ik gooide ook nooit eten weg k maakte een hevige sc ne toen mijn zoontjes hun bord niet leegaten tot ik opeens dacht waar ben ik nu eigenlijk mee bezig ik was altijd erg paniekerig toen ik tussen twee meren reed met naast me mijn gehandicapte man en op de achterbank een van onze zoontjes dacht ik wie van de twee moet ik nu redden als we in het water rijden ik zag overal gevaar in frankrijk liep ik weg van een familiebijeenkomst omdat ze het barbecuestel op een wankele tafel hadden gezet en dat niet wilden veranderen heel veel moeite had ik in frankrijk ook met de dat herinnerde te veel aan het kamp een internetaansluiting heb ik niet ik ben altijd bang voor dingen waarmee anderen inbreuk op mijn leven kunnen maken een offici le brief van de overheid bekijk ik met argwaan in het kamp lagen we hutjemutje naast elkaar in de barakken daarom wilde ik in het ziekenhuis nooit op een zaal met meerdere pati nten liggen als ik dat uitlegde kreeg ik een eigen kamer
4438514 een opname wilde ik niet door mijn eigen ervaringen kon ik de gedachte niet uitstaan dat mijn zoons zonder moeder zouden achterblijven vier jaar lang ben ik een dag per week naar oegstgeest gereisd gesprekstherapie speltherapie creatieve therapie het heeft me mezelf beter leren begrijpen
4438515 eerst maakte ik met fimoklei wat indisch eten na vervolgens ontstond er een keuken omheen en daarna een heel huis het was groot op mijn eetkamertafel was er nog net een hoekje vrij om te eten
4438516 het maken heeft me nachtmerries gekost maar ook heel veel plezier gegeven ik heb er veel in kunnen verwerken indi is nu wat verder van me af komen te staan ik koop er geen nieuwe boeken meer over en ga niet meer naar indi clubs het verleden blijft een plaats in mijn leven houden ik reageer bijvoorbeeld niet op chinees of koreaans maar wel als er japans gesproken wordt ik zat eens te lezen terwijl de tv aanstond daar kwam opeens een japanner aan het woord direct schokte mijn lijf op en eens in de zoveel tijd kijk ik onder mijn bed of er geen japanner verscholen ligt ik ben een vrolijke frans maar heb een aantal lastige dingen die gaan niet weg maar het is hanteerbaar geworden ik mag niet klagen ondanks alles heb ik een rijk leven gehad wat ik meesjouw is als een rugzakje het kan niet leeggemaakt worden maar ik heb er grip op en begrip voor gekregen oorlogskinderen zijn bonsaikinderen we zijn een beetje gekortwiekt
4438517 over de tweede wereldoorlog in nederlands indi en over de indische gemeenschap vanaf 1900 tot heden
4438518 een falend financieel management en een ernstig tekort schietend bestuur
4438519 uitgangspunt is dat een dergelijk centrum meer nadruk moet leggen op het herinneringsaspect en minder op het culturele aspect
4438520 we hebben duidelijke keuzes gemaakt zodat er iets ontstaat dat toekomstbestendig is
4438521 het nederlands instituut voor oorlogsdocumentatie ontwikkelt een werkdocument op grond daarvan zetten we samen met bronbeek een vernieuwde tentoonstelling op
4438522 the bibles theme is about redemption and atonement not finding meaning and solving problems
4438523 the average message i teach on a weekend contains fourteen passages of scripture i am a multi generation pastor which many of these critics dont i am a bible scholar ive had six years of greek and hebrew they dont know what theyre talking about and what happens is you often get pigeon holed because if a church is large then people tend to think its shallow and thats not true all large churches are not alike all mega churches are not alike
4438524 the truth is theres a lot of people who dont know whats going on and they read second and third and fourth hand reports which are incorrect
4438525 there have been things written for instance oh rick warren the hawaiian shirted pastor i havent worn a hawaiian shirt in two years but thats still being reported around the nation
4438526 there are all kinds of caricatures im criticized by people who are either ignorant or theyre jealous and the fact is were seeing god make a difference in individual lives thousands and thousands of lives i started this church with one person my wife today there over a 100 000 names on our church roll its the size of a city were a really big target and when you get invited to do an interview like this of course that creates all kinds of people who want to criticize you and when youre trying to promote the common good and when youre trying to promote civility there are a lot of people who have a stake in being uncivil they make their living polarizing and so if i were simply just the left than the right would criticize me and if i were just the right than the left would criticize me but im trying to stake out a common middle ground here so i get it from both sides and thats the price of impact
4438527 i would like to disavow a lot of the things that are done in the name of purpose driven or done in the name of saddleback because im not responsible for everybody elses church
4438528 for every example of negativity i could give you a hundred positivity weve trained now almost 500 000 church leaders around the world in 162 countries ive been training leaders for twenty eight years business leaders government leaders church leaders in a couple weeks im going to the nation of kenya where ive been invited to give an all day seminar on leadership to the entire parliament we just finished a thirty day tour of latin america
4438529 it doesnt bother me its like during the civil war the guy who wore the union blue top and the confederate blue bottom and he got shot at from both sides thats just part of trying to be a bridge builder a moderator a voice of civility our civilization is becoming increasingly uncivil were becoming ruder were not getting nicer to each other were getting ruder and some how we have to figure out as the world becomes more pluralistic to quote that great theologian rodney king cant we all just get along we dont have to agree we dont have to compromise our beliefs we dont have to water down our convictions but we do have to be civil and why do i believe that because jesus said love your neighbor as yourself in fact he said love your enemies so i am commanded to love people that i disagree with
4438530 and it seems like it might bother you a little bit
4438531 you are a huge success and your good works are undeniable and im not trying to take away from that but i sense in this interview that these people get under your skin a little bit
4438532 people get under my skin for about five seconds i consider both praise and criticism its kind of like chewing gum you chew on it for a little while but you dont swallow because ultimately im living for jesus christ thats my goal and my philosophy when criticism comes at me if its true listen and learn from it if its untrue ignore it and forget it
4438533 and ultimately realize god is the judge of your life
4438534 jesus said beware when all men speak well of you and i would point out that jesus was not criticized by the world he was criticized by the religious leaders and 27 39 the criticism i get is far greater from people who have staked out a very narrow position and want me to kowtow to that position rather than the poor the sick the needy the helpless the people jesus really cared about

4438541 it is an honour to know that our game is enjoyed by so many people from different backgrounds
4438542 from top professional players to football enthusiasts and kids who just want a kickabout in the streets its appeal is widening all the time the new become a legend and legends modes are designed to convey the pressure and pace a real pro experiences with players working as part of a strong side and working to prove their merit as a player i feel great and motivated when people enjoy our games and feel the new modes will open up new ways to enjoy pes
4438543 we have pulled out all the stops to make pes 2009 a landmark in footballing games
4438544 from the most basic controls through to the wide ranging additions to game modes such as become a legend all new visuals sound and the edit mode seabass and his team have strived to cram as much as they can into the new game and with more online announcements to follow there is every reason to believe that pes 2009 is the football game everyone has been waiting for
4438545 the people who deal with release dates are not film makers theyre worried about the bottom line
4438546 and the bottom line is they could do with a big film next year more than in november
4438547 i dont think theres a great overlap in the audiences for bond and potter
4438548 theyre different films aimed at different markets so i dont see them as competitors or rivals
4438549 you want to put your biggest releases on as many screens as possible
4438550 if there is a scenario where screens are being hogged by a film that is lingering around why not wait
4438551 i dont think theyre trying to eke out the cash cow longer
4438552 eight months wont make much difference overall in terms of the harry potter franchise
4438553 theres a worrying lack of product next year because of the writers strike and an actors strike could create another gap further down the line
4438554 why dont you just get a job like a normal person
4438555 i dont want to waste my life at a job i hate just to be a total loser like you if you had half a brain youd understand
4438556 i cant hang out with you guys i have way too much to do tonight poor me i never get to do anything fun anymore bring me back something nice
4438557 the first benefit of entrepreneurship can be traced back to ancient egypt
4438558 no thanks id like to go to disneyland with you but my work is way too much fun every minute brings a wonderful new surprise and i just cant tear myself away from this
4438559 you know youre always complaining about how awful your job is why dont you look into freelancing so you can have more control over your life
4438560 i know this is going to be extremely difficult but i really want to stay home to be with the kids i just have to make this work can i count on you for moral support
4438561 oh an entrepreneur was here golly im from metropolis i see entrepreneurs every day
4438562 why would i want a job i make more money working from my bed than i ever did in a stuffy old job

4438569 we have a reader with an impressive resume at the un let me ask him
4438570 i run a blog and my readers are very interested in this event but i dont have much experience with collisions can you walk me through the facts
4438571 we find talk of the economy slowing further house prices dropping further retail sales tumbling further all indicating that things will get worse before they get better its no surprise that consumers expect this deterioration to affect them as individuals as well as damaging the nations overall finances
4438572 some homeowners may be able to take a philosophical view of falling property values
4438573 reflecting that any cyclical market will encounter downs as well as ups but for those who are considering moving equity for debt consolidation or other purposes the impact is perceived as both serious and unlikely to improve in the near future
4438574 even those who arent directly affected by the credit crunch and the uncertainty in the housing market know theyre vulnerable to the knock on effects
4438575 given all the negative news its perhaps encouraging to see that only 8 of our respondents who consider themselves in debt see that debt as unmanageable today
4438576 the results of our survey may not make comfortable reading but its a relief to see that people are on the whole aware that there are problems ahead in general one of the rules of debt management is that tackling a debt problem early on can make it much easier to address the key question now is this how many of those people will take action in time to strengthen their financial position reduce their debts and improve their chances of coming through this downturn with as little financial damage as possible
4438577 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4438578 i have a very lovely psychiatrist who works with me in my offices and his christian background is that he tries to help homosexuals trying to turn away from what they are engaged in
4438579 i am happy to put any homosexual in touch with this gentleman and i have met people who have turned around to become heterosexual
4438580 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
4438581 can you think of anything more vile than man and man or woman and woman and sexually abusing children
4438582 what i say i base on biblical pronouncements based on gods word i am amazed that people are surprised when i quote from scriptures it shows the churches either arent preaching gods word or are watering it down
4438583 i cannot think of anything more sickening than a child being abused it is comparable to the act of homosexuality
4438584 i think they are all comparable i feel totally repulsed by both

4438590 we are so grateful to you for the work you have put into this incredible monument celebrating our history
4438591 as soon as i was approached i was immediately excited about this project and just knew i wanted to do it
4438592 i studied many photographs including a selection from the national archives it was a unique learning experience
4438593 im proud to be a born caymanian despite all the negativity in our islands during recent years cayman is still the only place i would want to live and raise my family
4438594 we remain committed to delivering first class events and we look forward to making bliss 2008 yet another success but know that none of our events could have been a success without the strong support of our patrons
4438595 they cayman islands probably have like two athletes so its a really rare one
4438596 its too bad because that pin will probably end up in a drawer somewhere in a few weeks ill probably never see another one like it
4438597 when i design the pins now im thinking about them forming part of a collection so its important to consider them alongside pins from all over the world and create a design that will stand out
4438598 cayman is a small place so the pins will be sought after because there are so few compared to bigger teams such as the us but they must be attractive as well
4438599 ever year when i design them im hoping they will be good ones that people will really want
4438600 olympic pins themselves have become an integral part of olympic culture and the pin trading centre is where people communicate during the olympic games
4438601 we hope that the pin trading centres offer the ultimate experience and memories of the olympics and culture for people from all around the world
4438602 joining forces with the fresh air fund is an amazing partnership that not only acts as a means of community outreach but also acts as a tool to market our islands to the city of new york and ultimately the united states
4438603 the fresh air fund chose these kids because of their outstanding achievements in school and we are happy to welcome them to our home as a result of their hard work leaving a lasting impression on them is the best marketing tool we could ask for and we look forward to hosting them again in subsequent years
4438604 the cayman islands is a family destination families can go to boatswains beach pedro st james the butterfly farm and also indulge in many other activities so we would like to encourage the families on this cruise to return the islands and stay for at least a few days
4438605 the cayman islands will have receptions like this for inaugural visits but this one is special because of the nickelodeon brand alignment for families in the summer months
4438606 nickelodeons consumers are ours so we have an opportunity to showcase the island at this event and hope that they will be back we dont underestimate the power that young consumers have on the household
4438607 certain stakeholders in the development of the port including numerous cruise lines have been left with the mistaken belief that caribbean marine services has been involved in and fully briefed on the development of the port
4438608 we see them as one of our key stakeholders and were not going to leave them out of the discussions were always going to offer ourselves to them for advice on how they can restructure
4438609 my gut tells me that is a much more lucrative business than what they currently get per head for tendering passenger services
4438610 we have the biggest tender fleet in the caribbean we have 18 vessels and carry more than a million people per year
4438611 tenders are custom made you top load a tender which is built to match the height of the cruise ship so if youre moving from ship to dock or from dock to dock its fine but where am i going to go
4438612 this comes from the situation in st maarten because the terminal was away from the town centre
4438613 so if our port was in say west bay well maybe you could do it
4438614 at no time did any meeting take place between the directors of caribbean marine services and the honorable minister in relation to the berthing facilities or tendering services in the cayman islands in 2005
4438615 the directors of caribbean marine services did however meet approximately three years ago with the honourable minister to discuss the proposed berthing facilities and to the best of the directors knowledge tendering was not discussed
4438616 but thats not our place we went to government with a proposal to build cruise berths and any negotiations really are governments place to do the talking
4438617 based on our experience at camana bay we decided to start a cayman corporation we hope to deliver the same level of service we provide camana bay to other organizations in the cayman islands and the caribbean
4438618 our skill set in call centres data networks and voice over ip as well as our certifications to sell high end nortel products makes us unique
4438619 the goal of camana bay was to build a network infrastructure that would support the objectives laid out by the systems department just as importantly it was convenient to depend on a technological platform which would support solutions like voice data security and video which would at the same time give us flexibility to grow not just for the project administrators but especially for our clients
4438620 my goal was to do a 2 00 but i went to 2 01 i am still happy with that it is still a great swim and i feel really good because this is my first olympics
4438621 last summer at the pan am games he was doing 2 06 and 2 07 and now he is down to 2 01
4438622 now that he is starting to see that he can do well in this sport he is starting to really believe in what he is doing and be up there with the best
4438623 the same lord is lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him
4438624 take heart take courage it is i do not be afraid remain with me in faith and build and be built into my future that i intend to bestow upon you
4438625 the job allows me to interact with the general public
4438626 but my 3 year old son anthony wayne lives here in cayman
4438627 i presently play cricket with by rite cricket club i am a cayman islands football association referee and i still play social football with the unity football club at the george hicks field
4438628 my favourite sports is cricket even my vacation plans are centred around the west indies home series so i can go and watch in this environment sports plays an important role
4438629 my son anthony has an excellent throwing arm i can see him fielding at third man after completing his over bowling fast
4438630 child and teen safety and stop predators act sarahs law
4438631 when h e the governor stuart jack first announced this investigation i gave a commitment to update the community as often as possible i did this because i appreciate the fact that the outcome of the investigation will be of national importance
4438632 i report directly to the governor and my work is overseen by the metropolitan police service assistant commissioner john yates this ensures total independence and accountability
4438633 recently i shared with you that my team has prepared and sent a report to the attorney generals office in respect of deputy commissioner rudolph dixon and mr burmon scott this report has now been reviewed as a result i can confirm today that mr rudolph dixon has been charged with two counts of misconduct in a public office and two counts of doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice mr dixon will appear in court on wednesday 6 august
4438634 i would like clarity to the subject as this is seen as lack of transparency
4438635 in recent times i have been accused of only arresting and charging persons from the brac
4438636 i have said it in earlier press briefings that i am not ready to interview mr kernohan but his day is coming and the allegations will be thoroughly investigated and a decision will be made on the findings
4438637 there have been numerous phone calls in which persons are giving statements about the integrity issues within the rcips the information is currently being assessed at the end of which decisions will be taken as how to take matters forward
4438638 im not here to only arrest persons or police officers if there are concerns then they will be dealt with our aim is to rebuild the confidence in the rcips and foster greater community relations
4438639 i want persons to know that it is really hard to make allegations or to give information on a fellow coworker especially if that person has a higher rank than you
4438640 its not an easy task to report a friend or family member
4438641 on that note i encourage anyone who has information on integrity issues within the rcips to come forward and report it you can call me personally on 927 2981 as i have said all matters will be dealt with in the strictest of confidence
4438642 i know and do understand that these are difficult times for the rcips and the community however i believe there is an increasing appetite to collectively change things for an even better police service
4438643 i have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of rcips officers are honest hardworking and committed individuals
4438644 other police forces throughout the world also experience these issues but it has been proven that it is the minority who behave inappropriately that undermines a police services credibility and erodes the communitys trust in this regard the rcips is no different
4438645 whatever the end result may be of the current and new investigations the emphasis is to improve for the future
4438646 hopefully i will make new friends and get a feel of the different personalities and varied culture at the conference
4438647 i want to complete two years on the brac then the other two years in grand cayman as the scope of settling in a good job and the opportunity to garner more experience will occur there than on the brac
4438648 im happy for everyone who turned out to join us this ministry and we will return to cayman brac in the near future
4438649 over the past few months we have all experienced the painful effects of global oil price increases certainly the global oil problem is not in this governments control but locally we are taking steps that we hope will ease the financial burden for caymans residents
4438650 once these regulations are approved and gazetted wholesale gasoline and diesel distributors must notify in writing the chief petroleum inspector
4438651 it is up to dealers to add their mark up prices on these commodities
4438652 we dont control prices because its a free market enterprise the dealers set their own prices and we cannot impose any sanctions on the dealers on how high they wish to set the price for each gallon of fuel
4438653 if wholesalers are dissatisfied with the chief petroleum inspectors decision they would have a means of redress there is an appeals process which will involve the governor in cabinet
4438654 oil prices are siphoning money out of everyones pockets and this determines how far our wages and salaries will stretch
4438655 without some effort to manage escalating costs our pockets could be drained even drier than they are now this governments foremost responsibility is to look after the welfare of its citizens and this is exactly what we hope to do with these amendments
4438656 while this initiative is also a step in a positive direction persons may consider car pooling and doing other things to ensure that they are able to finance themselves adequately
4438657 we have checked the pump fuel prices more frequently to ensure they match those posted on the roadside signs
4438658 this group is serious about service and the support is needed from other members in the community to join forces in making the club a success
4438659 working for bic is challenging because its new i have to learn everything but its not hard when im shown how to do it
4438660 over the past several years we have had the opportunity to employ cbhs graduates as interns
4438661 we are pleased to be able to offer them work experience that will not only broaden their computer technology skill base but will give them a valuable addition to their resume when they eventually follow their career path
4438662 we see this as an opportunity to invest in our young people and their futures and most importantly we hope that they will choose to come back at some point and build their careers here on the brac
4438663 robert is a bright and capable young man who has a bright future ahead of him and i have every confidence that he will take full advantage of this year at brac informatics
4438664 the church and its youth ministry have been blessed with an exceptional talent
4438665 the church has been active in numerous outreach programmes throughout the community and this they intend to expand on we will also be enthused to render any assistance to members within the community once a real need has been identified
4438666 i am confident the lord will provide all the resources for the completion of the building
4438667 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
4438668 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
4438669 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy
4438670 when i finished the house was on its feet man and i was a hit so i started pursuing music big time
4438671 at the end of the day we are responsible for our own lives
4438672 if anything happens to us dont blame somebody else backtrack and look at what you did to contribute to that you also contribute to your successes once you learn that youre on your way
4438673 it was great to come back to my roots not only was it a wedding but it was also a reunion
4438674 we were fortunate to piece together our ancestry and have a wedding and we all loved it
4438675 i was homesick and i missed the quiet life of cayman brac and my family
4438676 losing my mother at a tender age was very difficult and so i was drawn to other family members for comfort
4438677 in my spare time i enjoy gardening and spending time with my two dogs pougie and tyson she also shares a good camaraderie with her co workers and she is happy that her working environment is a friendly one
4438678 i would like to mention a concern for the elderly at the rest home in the hope that some volunteers would construct a nice gardening area for them the elderly are important figures in the community and building a garden would allow them to get some fresh air and sunshine during the days and allowing their family to visit them in a friendlier environment as some relatives dont feel comfortable going into the rest home
4438679 they express to me that they feel left out at times and feel they have nothing to look forward to
4438680 most importantly i want my children to know that i love them very much and will always be there for them
4438681 i was taught by burmon as a child to play the drums i know he has so much potential and i thought id invite him to teach my kids
4438682 i wasnt expecting the kids to be so talented when i came to see them play i found that they all had great timing
4438683 i grew up loving music especially playing with my father its good when your family is involved and having a father supporting us
4438684 i never expected to be so good i feel proud
4438685 i feel that we can come together as a family do something and accomplish it im proud of my family for that
4438686 i am willing to take the criticism of the extension to the high school one thing is sure is that it is done and serving its purpose
4438687 no longer should residents of the sister islands especially our youths be treated as second class citizens
4438688 we need to invest in them for us to have a brighter future
4438689 cayman brac has been producing some fantastic talent with the likes of steven tatum and michael sanford who were both called to the national u 20 team and had the privilege of playing with the team for world cup qualifiers
4438690 the new field is not yet completed with a few things outstanding such as lighting and other amenities we were pondering getting lights that are found at the truman bodden stadium but that is a bit expensive so we are looking into other possibilities
4438691 cayman airways will meet the need of the growing market as they are now looking at a 70 seat jet to service direct flights from the united states to cayman brac
4438692 we are clear eyed about the sort of media age we live in
4438693 these things are always going to get attention its part of the right wing media strategy
4438694 were going to make sure that every time the book is discussed everyone who reads about it also reads that he got a bunch of things wrong
4438695 hes a discredited liar hes peddling garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4438696 if you are a winner what are the positive contributions that you could make to your country or society as a whole
4438697 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4438698 a little bit of controllability issue in terms of our ability to control the aircraft in the pitch which is the nose up and nose down mode
4438699 we have senator obama on board the aircraft and his campaign
4438700 nicole saw that even a clean blanket was out of reach for some of these new moms so she wanted to figure out an efficient way to connect them with companies and individuals who want to help
4438701 we take for granted the basic necessities for some families its a serious struggle
4438702 this is one way to ease the financial burden and help new babies have a good start in life we are only working with companies and products that joel and i would use were checking every product out for safety and all products are bpa free
4438703 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
4438704 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
4438705 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
4438706 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
4438707 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me

4438713 we have got to fight it with everything weve got
4438714 put simply we cannot let the liberals take this country back to the tax and spend policies of the past
4438715 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4438716 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4438717 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4438718 i see mr dion has been threatening to defeat the government again this summer i am starting to feel like i am starring alongside bill murray in the movie groundhog day
4438719 h alguns dias o presidente da fran a nicolas sarkozy obteve o acordo dos russos e dos georgianos sobre os seis pontos
4438720 e houve acordo sobre esses pontos como sendo um conjunto de princ pios agora necess rio um cessar fogo formal e nisso que estamos a trabalhar
4438721 sebab tidak ada jaminan bahwa penurunan harga minyak akan tetap konstan tahun depan
4438722 tetapi sebagai asumsi awal saya pikir angka ini cukup rasional dan kalaupun menyimpang jauh pemerintah masih bisa melakukan perubahan apbn
4438723 indonesia sangat berkesan bagi saya orang orangnya ramah dan baik hati negara yang sangat modern dan bersih
4438724 indonesia bagi saya sangat indah dengan keberagaman suku agama dan budaya saya dapat belajar banyak dari keberagaman itu sebagai bekal saya menjalani tugas miss universe ke berbagai negara di dunia
4438725 its disgusting i tell you the way the opposition is running that ethics hearing trampling over everyone else just because they happen to have a majority on the committee they think they can everything their way and not have to play nice with anyone else
4438726 how undelete makes sure that you recover your deleted files
4438727 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside
4438728 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories
4438729 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him

4438740 if the information in your credit report is correct and has been verified by a credit bureau there is no legal way to rectify that other than time
4438741 less than 5 of letters disputing correct information are effective
4438742 stay away from extremely low cost fee credit repair companies the only reason they can offer their services at such low prices is because they only dispute a limited amount of accounts usually five on one credit report at a time we on the other hand dispute all negative accounts on all three bureaus on the very first step
4438743 lets say your credit report shows you have late payments on your credit card three months in a row back in 2006 well dispute your visa or master card company asking for proof of this the fact is either theyll not respond with the right evidence because they have no record of the item or not bother with our dispute at all then just like that the three months of late payments according to your credit record never even happened by law it has to come off your credit record
4438744 often they make you aware of your credit problems and are able to tell you what youve done wrong
4438745 everything a credit repair clinic can do for you legally you can do for yourself at little or no cost

4438753 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4438754 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4438755 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4438756 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4438757 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4438758 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff

4438760 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example

4438777 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
4438778 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4438779 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4438780 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4438781 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4438782 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4438783 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4438784 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4438785 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream
4438786 but that also means that you can lock in a price that wont increase when the economy improves that savings can be substantial and it can give you a huge advantage over your competition
4438787 my brother is getting ready to take his entire family to orlando for a vacation
4438788 and ive tried to convince him that he should vacation closer to home and use that money to make some investments in five or 10 years nothing will be left of that 4 000 vacation other than some photos but using that money for investments now will leave him with 20 000 or even 30 000 in the bank down the road

4438802 back in july kevin harvick paid a surprise visit to chris and jim lamb who have a huge collection of antique shell oil company signage and collectibles several weeks before these folks sent a note to kevin at his race shop in kernersville north carolina telling him of their collection and inviting him to visit their house in maine little did they know that kevin had already planned to run the td banknorth 250 late model race in oxford maine in his final nascar sprint cup series off weekend during the july 19th 20th weekend not only was the surprise visit to the unofficial shell museum special for these shell fans in maine but kevin went on and won the event in dominating fashion one of the largest short track races in the united states kevin was the 7th daytona 500 champion to compete in that late model race
4438803 in my short four months with the company i continue to be irritated and disappointed in the many issues that i continue to uncover and need to be addressed the elephant in the room today is q3 of 2008 we posted record revenues yet we lost money how can that be april and may combined for aloss of 637 000 had june continued as in past trends we would have ended up losing 750 000 in the quarter however we began an aggressive sales strategy in may in the atv accessories segment to capture orders that were at risk and took market segment away from our competitors as a result june revenue was over 1 7 million higher than any other previous june what is particularly frustrating is that the effect of this record revenue was diminished by increased raw material costs and sg amp a although the company implemented a significant price increase of its own we were not able to pass on the full price increase to distributors and customers in order to remain competitive
4438804 i am embarrassed by the pitiful performance of the weekend warrior segment if it can be called a segment less than 13 000 for the quarter is disgraceful there had been virtually no sales efforts in this segment for most of the year prior to my arrival and we are experiencing the consequences i still believe that this will be a successful market segment but i dont realistically expect to see any real revenue growth in this segment until q1 of 2009
4438805 another disappointing segment is the plastic wheel covers division at a time when revenue for this segment should be increasing it is decreasing the reason is the past lack of effective marketing and customer service which resulted in unhappy customers that are former customers we are now doing a better job of selling the capabilities to current and new customers
4438806 we are re establishing and strengthening relations with new and existing oems we are doing that and our revenue through oems is increasing inventory levels have rarely been higher than they were at the end of q3 the sales efforts of q3 are beginning to reduce that but it is not fast enough we have and will increase our efforts in that area

4438880 were hoping cristiano will do well he comes with a good pedigree hes scored in european leagues overseas so hopefully hell be one to look out for
4438881 hes scored a couple in pre season and we just need him to knock in another 10 15 more this year and we should be right

4438896 weve spoken about what we want to achieve this year and our main goal our first goal is to make the top four theres no ifs or buts about that its a must

4438898 i was at the a league launch in sydney and we were well and truly under the radar no one expects us to do very well well see what happens this year

4438906 god demonstrates his love for us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us

4439034 many of them were destroyed by degas brother in an attempt to preserve the artists reputation and those that survived were auctioned off and scattered among various private collectors

4439040 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4439041 totally baseless and malicious recent spate of unsubstantiated news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf was resigning
4439042 such unsubstantiated reports were creating uncertainty and negatively impacting the economy of the country
4439043 his close aides approached the government and were clearly told that the only way to avoid impeachment is to step down the government does not want him to remain in the presidency

4439060 its about giving everyone the most information possible to help them make the right decisions
4439061 these people are desperate for information desperate for a cure they are ripe for manipulation
4439062 you can type in a symptom and get 100 different possible diagnoses
4439063 patients who are predisposed to have a lot of anxiety will latch on to the worst possible scenario even if that scenario is extraordinarily remote and start to believe they have that illness

4439076 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside
4439077 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth

4439098 the outstanding sales result for august once again demonstrates the economic value the oil and gas industry has for our province
4439099 we said in the bc energy plan that we would make b c among the most competitive oil and gas jurisdictions in north america and this ongoing interest and investment confirms it
4439100 these sales are a positive indication that b c s leading environmental policies which include legislation for a cap and trade system and the elimination of routine flaring at oil and gas producing wells has provided a level playing field and certainty to industry
4439101 revenue from these sales continues to fund vital social programs and infrastructure development in communities throughout british columbia

4439160 let me be frank with you while we are not at war the current situation in mindanao is still volatile and fluid the pullout of the 105th base command could be a plot to buy time assess its capability and reconstitute its forcs to launch similar atrocities in other areas of central mindanao

4439185 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4439186 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4439187 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4439188 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4439189 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4439191 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4439192 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4439193 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4439194 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4439195 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4439196 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4439197 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4439198 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4439199 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4439200 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4439201 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4439202 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4439203 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4439204 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4439205 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4439206 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4439207 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4439208 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4439209 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4439210 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4439211 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4439212 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4439213 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4439214 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4439215 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4439216 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4439217 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4439218 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4439219 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4439220 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4439221 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4439222 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4439223 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4439224 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4439225 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4439226 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4439227 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4439228 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4439229 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4439230 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4439231 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4439232 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4439233 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4439234 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4439235 you peeped the sheets are transparent you have x ray vision
4439236 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4439237 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4439238 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4439239 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4439240 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4439241 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4439242 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4439243 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4439244 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4439245 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4439246 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4439247 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4439248 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4439249 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4439476 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4439477 i honestly didnt know until she finished and the scores came up
4439478 op een gegeven moment mocht ze uit de kano en werd ze gesommeerd op het droge te wachten totdat een sheriff van het antidopingbureau wada gearriveerd was
4439479 uiteindelijk hebben we drie minuten de tijd gehad om de video van de halve finale te bekijken toen begon de finale al waanzin het wada be nvloedt gewoon deze finale dat kan toch niet
4439480 ik had helemaal niet de tijd om daarover na te denken
4439481 met een degelijke voorbereiding had ze die fout nooit gemaakt en was brons mogelijk geweest het is een schandaal
4439482 ik probeer maar niet te veel te denken aan wat er was gebeurd wanneer ik op een normale manier de finale was ingegaan
4439483 dit zijn de olympische spelen h er gebeuren altijd rare dingen
4439484 nee dat vind ik niet je mag toch verwachten dat de organisatie op orde is
4439485 dios ha de derramar sobre espa a su furor e ira porque toda ella ha comunicado y participado poco que mucho en las sangrientas riquezas robadas y tan usurpadas y mal habidas y con tantos estragos y acabamientos de aquellas gentes si gran penitencia no hiciere y creo que tarde o nunca la har porque la ceguedad que dios por nuestros pecados ha permitido en grandes y chicos y mayormente en los que presumen y tienen nombre desabios y pretenden mandar el mundo por los pecados de ellos ygeneralmente de toda ella a n digo esta oscuridad de losentendimientos tan reciente que desde setenta a os que ha comenzado a escandalizar robar e matar y extirpar aquellanaciones no se haya hasta hoy advertido que tanto esc ndalo e infamias de nuestra santa fe tantos robos tantas injusticias tantos estragos tantas matanzas tantos cautiverios tantas usurpacionesde estados y se or os ajenos y finalmente tan universales desolaciones y despoblacioneshayan sido pecado y grandisima injusticia
4439486 todos est is en pecado mortal por la crueldad y tiran a que us is
4439487 el diezmo impuesto recibido por las autoridades religiosas as como las donaciones hechas por la monarqu a y por los creyentes dieron a la iglesia grandes capitales que otorgaba en pr stamo a los individuos y aun al gobierno asimismo acumul numerosas propiedades en las ciudades y en el campo que como no se pod a vender crearon un acaparamiento poco productivo lo que provocar a serios problemas durante el siglo xix
4439488 eu joguei dois anos em porto alegre e sei que a tradi o do futebol ga cho jogar com bola a rea e marca o forte com os atacantes brigando pela bola em todo momento por isso vamos tentar explorar os pontos que vimos em que eles d o mais facilidades

4439495 theres a sort of movement in mainstream circles in books that have more kid appeal especially when it comes to boys its a shift away from the homelier books we all grew up with
4439496 dont bash bush bond with the male nurses and gay guys and dont forget hairy iraqi women jokes kill every time if youre stuck
4439497 if you want to learn more about my life youll just have to wait and see
4439498 this is august 7 this is my birthday and im taking a bath in the sink at burger king
4439499 any bacteria on his skin could have been deposited giving people food poisoning
4439500 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
4439501 we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video
4439502 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4439503 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4439504 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4439505 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4439506 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4439507 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4439508 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4439509 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4439510 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4439511 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4439512 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4439513 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4439514 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4439515 friends i got hit on the head i am ok now but in a few minutes
4439516 some 10 15 soldiers sprayed our car with weapons for at least 4 or 5 minutes i could not move the vehicle since the engine broke down we shouted at the soldiers that we were journalists we also took our t shirts off and waved them out of windows some 4 or 5 minutes later soldiers approached us
4439517 i have been hit by a bullet you can see i am scratched here most likely it was a sniper it has most likely been a light weapon since its a minor wound
4439518 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues

4439520 while aid is reaching people and to some degree stability is returning to peoples lives the critical period is still far from over emergency phase is not yet over
4439521 food assistance continues to provide a vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people affected by the cyclone
4439522 the burmese government has agreed to continue the use of the helicopter operation albeit with a reduced fleet
4439523 we still need us 41million to secure our planned assistance up to the end april 2009
4439524 the government of canada is proud to match dollar for dollar the donations of the canadians so that the men women and children affected by the terrible tragedy can receive life saving food water shelter and medical attention that they need
4439525 we are very pleased with canadas quick response to the cyclone victims in burma

4439529 its a very big step for my mother but i think she is looking forward to her retirement as well
4439530 she would like to thank all her regular customers for all of their support over the years and all the kind wishes during the last week
4439531 shes been here 25 years and it is unfortunate for it to end like this but there have been lots of people coming in this morning just to wish her well
4439532 it is an emotional day so i wanted to come in to give her a bit of support
4439533 we had a freakishly quite period late last year with very few high profile releases

4439562 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future

4439576 cuando me dijeron que iba a ser de novio de vanesa gonz lez en socias pregunt qui n era me dijeron la de son de fierro y media falta yo hab a visto media falta alguna vez
4439577 a m me dijeron que iba a ser pareja de mart n piroyansky me acordaba que hab a trabajado en amas de casa desesperadas pero no sab a mucho m s y ahora mir nos llevamos s per
4439578 los dos somos muy t midos al extremo pero tenemos diferente manera de sacar la timidez el se queda callado y yo me pongo charlatana o puedo resultar asquerosa
4439579 los primeros d as la escena de los dos solos en el motorhome era horrible y graciosa al mismo tiempo no hab a onda no hab a tema para conversar era tremendo
4439580 nos empezamos a llevar bien y ahora nos divertimos juntos y creo tambi n que eso se nota en pantalla
4439581 si bien somos muy diferentes de personalidad somos muy parecidos a la hora de actuar hay muchos que se agarran de la letra y se quedan ah cosa que tambi n es profesional pero nosotros tenemos eso de querer encontrarle algo m s a la situaci n planteada y que grabar sea poner algo nuestro tambi n respetamos la letra pero le aportamos mucha improvisaci n y por suerte mercedes mor n con quien tienen la mayor a de las escenas tambi n es as y pablo fischerman el directo est muy abierto a ese recurso ni vane ni yo somos de esa clase de actores que sale del camar n en personaje y termina la acci n y sigue en la misma

4439588 faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to
4439589 its not right that the russians and the los angeles city council want to force groups of people into the heart of an existing country and community rather than let them look after their own affairs without outside intrusion
4439590 let nations and neighborhoods manage their own affairs and if they want help theyll ask for it the idea that outside organizations are forcing their will on people who are getting along fine without their interference is disgusting georgia is a democracy and the neighborhoods in l a have grown up and developed and been organized according to basic zoning laws if you want to change the law of the city or encourage alternative viewpoints in another country you need to take the people who are already living there into account you cant just arbitrarily make a decision and say take it and like it to the people there its wrong
4439591 those who wield power can do what they want because they can charles darwin joseph stalin and bill clinton taught us that
4439592 l a leaders do what they want and vladimir putin has made it clear that what he wants to get what he wants and putin wants the old soviet union back over the last several years putin banned the russian provinces from electing governors and now moscow appoints them he put troops in former soviet states and told them it was for their protection the same kind of protection the mafia provided chicago shop keepers in the u s during the 1930s he said that the collapse of the soviet union was the worse thing to have happened in the past century of world history worse than the nazi extermination of the jews darfur earthquakes floods you name it hes selling nuclear material and technical expertise to the iranians and oppressing the christian majority in georgia at the behest of a iranian affiliated muslim minority he does what he wants because he can and hell act just like stalin because it works he turns me on i love the guy i want to clone him i want to give birth to his cloned babies three at a time
4439593 the united nations is capable of writing a strongly worded statement condemning the actions of the russians or l a city council and these kinds of things are best left to them
4439594 i am a world citizen and recognize that sometimes nations redraw boundaries and that results in change i like change and the biggest thing i want is for america to change i want my wife to be proud of america more often then once when i took the lead in the polls my global poverty act s 2433 would allocate just 0 7 percent of the u s gross national product or a mere 845 billion commitment to the u n and michelle would like that im buddies with people like reverend wright bill ayers and tony rezko so you know i can get along with vladimir putin mahmoud ahmadinejad and osama bin laden of course i just listen and they do what they want but thats one of the keys to getting along and one of the changes i want at the u s presidential level a good listener who raises taxes to fund what they want and lets the rest of the world do whatever they want we can have peace in our time and get killed or invaded last its a vision worth having

4439651 the thing to remember is that the american economy is cyclical its going to have ups and downs and a downturn gives you the chance to invest in otherwise healthy companies at a discount
4439652 money you invest now can buy more fund shares than it would have a year ago and as the market recovers that portfolio can bring a substantial gain
4439653 even the most aggressive investor should only devote a small portion of their assets to such a bet
4439654 the thing to remember is that the rich got that way by successfully balancing risk and reward
4439655 despite the current housing slump many houses are still being sold every day
4439656 and if you are able to make a purchase youll often be able to acquire something well below even the current market value by holding on to that property for a few years you can often make a substantial profit
4439657 a bad economy forces you to think about the future its a valuable opportunity to review your priorities and make some decisions about where you want your life to be while a recession might not be the time for most people to start their dream business it is the perfect time to lay the groundwork for the future
4439658 bad economic times mean that many companies are looking for a guaranteed revenue stream

4439724 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4439725 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4439764 i like what you did with the song you performed well you made the song your own and brought out that something special which made us all feel very proud of you
4439765 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4439766 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4439767 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4439768 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4439769 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4439770 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4439771 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4439772 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4439773 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4439774 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4439775 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4439776 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4439777 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4439778 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4439779 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4439780 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4439781 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart
4439782 they see the skin graft we use to put it back together
4439783 i was afraid the anesthesia would go wrong or id wake up coughing my head off and split my guts open
4439784 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity god willing we will complete them as soon as possible

4439793 this year is really tough because youre starting to think this wont be solved after five years
4439794 you feel like your hands are tied because you dont really have the authority to actually go out here and do the work of the law
4439795 this the vigil you kind of feel like youre helping maybe keeping it in the publics eye or the killers eye
4439796 i get mad at the killer i get mad at the law i get mad at the public because i feel like somebody out there knows something
4439797 we just want justice done we want answers to our questions i mean id like to know why they killed her and id like to know who

4439821 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4439822 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4439823 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4439824 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4439825 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4439826 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4439827 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted

4439836 instruments will be used that we dont see every day like langspil an icelandic string instrument harp and fiddle
4439837 because it coincides with the berry picking season in lafsfj rdur so festival goers can use the opportunity to pick blue and crow berries

4439839 i have to stand by my conviction im not interested in disturbing things for the progressive party or skar bergsson but i dont have any faith in this coalition if i were to support it i would be accepting the behavior of the independence party during this term and the politics they have practiced i just cant accept that
4439840 it was absolutely fantastic to wave to my parents who were watching waving the icelandic flag and cheering me on it was great to dive into the pool and break an icelandic record in my first olympics

4439844 we lack experience playing on a full size field and this will be the weakest aspect of our game but a lot of our kids have been playing against the men in the vancouver senior competition and this will allow them to compete against the clubs we are matched up against
4439845 quite a few of our kids are already talking about doing the same thing as scott has done and giving footy a chance it is in the canadian make up to move to further your sports career and this takes one of the hurdles away that is sometimes associated with international players
4439846 being at the forefront of live music is exactly where we want to be and gives us plenty to build on for listeners and commercial parties

4439849 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4439850 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4439851 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4439852 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4439854 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes
4439855 the goods are registered by a camera integrated in the scales an image evaluation algorithm compares the image with stored data and thus automatically recognizes which type of fruit this is
4439856 the new scales are very tolerant to fluctuations in color and brightness the module can be employed under many different kinds of illumination and with different kinds of camera supermarket employees can of course extend the selection of fruit recognized by the scales to make it include new varieties
4439857 the marketing effect of organising the olympics is not necessarily good in that respect the troms olympics is a high risk project
4439858 students who followed most of the television broadcasts from the winter olympics in torino got a less favourable impression of the italian people as a result of the event
4439859 overall there are good reasons for questioning whether a sensible decision maker should stake several billions of kroner on organising the olympics if economic development and promoting of the country are the essential issues
