3650155 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3650156 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3650157 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen

3650161 the gown is supposed to be a classic design it is supposed to be simple they are not supposed to stand out but you still want an element of your own design in there so we are probably going to take a couple of the bodies from previous collections make them floor length and put them in chiffon so it will be a classic beautiful look with my own twist

3650171 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3650172 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences

3650207 many people believe in god because they believe they have seen a vision of him or of an angel or a virgin in blue with their own eyes or he speaks to them inside their heads this argument from personal experience is the one that is most convincing to those who claim to have had one but it is the least convincing to anyone else and anyone knowledgeable about psychology
3650208 you say you have experienced god directly well some people have experienced a pink elephant but that probably doesnt impress you peter sutcliffe the yorkshire ripper distinctly heard the voice of jesus telling him to kill women and he was locked up for life george w bush says that god told him to invade iraq a pity god didnt vouchsafe him a revelation that there were no weapons of mass destruction individuals in asylums think they are napoleon or charlie chaplin or that the entire world is conspiring against them or that they can broadcast their thoughts into other peoples heads we humour them but dont take their internally revealed beliefs seriously mostly because not many people share them religious experiences are different only in that the people who claim them are numerous sam harris was not being overly cynical when he wrote in the end of faith
3650209 we have names for people who have many beliefs for which there is no rational justification

3650213 you mean that wasnt jonathan taylor thomas singing as simba how dare disney
3650214 the only thing we need to see out him now is how he will handle the pressures during the games
3650215 he can run that 4 40 just getting out of bed
3650216 he has a chance to play at wide receiver and is a very gifted kick and punt returner
3650217 we have four guys that we will figure out in matt lee chris ganious isaac newton and dion foster
3650218 we have two bigger backs and two smaller backs we also have a talented freshman in marcus sims the one thing i can tell you is its going to be typical coyote football with the running game and we are going to have a really good back
3650219 its great to pratice again to have the guys back and to see them bounce around with pads on
3650220 it feels like football time again the players have gotten right into it and they seem to have picked things up
3650221 our offense looked crisp today and our defense looks really fast and athletic
3650222 but its early of course ask me again in a couple of day and i could say the offense stinks and the defense stinks and we are all tired because thats how camp goes

3650229 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues
3650230 well i dont comment on any of that i just do my job
3650231 im sure in the not too distant future he will tell australians what he intends to do
3650232 i dont think anybody should underestimate how politically difficult it is going to be in the united states to pass legislation for an emissions trading scheme if there is not commitment and action coming from the other major emitters throughout the world
3650233 one of the key messages that from those that ive spoken to in both europe but particularly the united states is that we cannot afford to basically transfer money from low income american or australian households into the pockets of already wealthy people who are running utilities in other countries
3650234 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3650235 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3650236 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3650237 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court
3650238 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3650239 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3650240 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3650241 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure

3650244 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3650245 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3650246 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3650247 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3650248 it takes more than a great body to make it in the wwe

3650255 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3650256 he wasnt in nose guard territory but he would have been a big linebacker
3650257 he worked with our academic counselors as far as making sure that he had the right courses and was on the right path
3650258 shonn didnt come around a lot i dont know if it means that he doesnt like us he was really more of a ghost but he was in town here working and all that stuff
3650259 im not rally worried if he was in bad shape id be worried
3650260 but he was able to join the team about midway through june and all the feedback was positive if he was way out of shape then id be worried because it takes time to get guys in shape
3650261 so at least were not talking about a reclamation project and i had that thought in my mind at one time too when i saw him in the spring
3650262 the nice thing about it is hes got a good attitude hes an older guy whos got some hardness to him that veteran players have
3650263 thatll be a real nice contribution to make to our football team not just our offense but our football team

3650310 i never thought that middle east e gaming development would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
3650311 we find this paper about middle east e gaming development from pancho marxen to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
3650312 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by middle east e gaming development firms would go a long way
3650313 speaking from a personal viewpoint i believe that the more we can get out of this time period the better
3650314 we can all look forward and predict financial success for all involved but that comes tempered with a bit of risk right now
3650315 i am a big fan of this middle east e gaming development paper it lays out the ground work for exceptional progress and investment in this sector personally im going to invest my own funds in project development

3650319 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there

3650321 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3650322 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3650323 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3650324 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself

3650346 i wanted to see you off the first time anyones taken second place from me in years youve got some talent
3650347 you were some trouble though do you know how much money you cost me by slamming into my car so many times
3650348 you cost me a hefty chunk of cash too you certainly arent suffering for money though are you i mean a limousine is pretty ritzy for an hour trip
3650349 well i did get second place and i could win the whole tournament i also needed enough room for some body guards theres some crazy fans out there know what i mean
3650350 naturally i know exactly what youre talking about thankfully all of us racers are sensible
3650351 speaking of guards there they are along with my driver i should get going ill see you around all right
3650352 that would be great if i win youd be racing against a champion
3650353 wouldnt that be nice good bye nathaniel and good luck
3650354 i hope he enjoys the perks of his limo while he can
3650355 i should get going myself i would hate to miss the race
3650356 this just in survival races tournament competitor nathaniel robins was just killed in a car crash nathaniel age 34 was set to compete for the title of survival races champion today which has many people wondering if this was the result of foul play or mere coincidence
3650357 police are still looking into the matter but from eyewitness accounts it seems like the driver may have actually fallen asleep at the wheel causing the limousine to lose control and swerve into an oncoming truck the driver of the truck suffered from severe injuries and was airlifted to the nearest hospital the driver of the limousine died from neck injuries just moments ago while being airlifted and the other passengers said to be guards suffered from terrible injuries as well three of them died leaving one in critical condition nathaniel unfortunately died instantly from the impact of the crash as for who will be taking his place in the tournament it is said to be elias theodore who came in third in the decisive race yesterday we have been unable to reach him for any comments
3650358 ms houston the press has already arrived here and theyre asking for your thoughts on the matter of mr robins death it might be nice if you said something
3650359 of course although im much more interested in what elias is going to say about this when he gets here
3650360 i dont know this just seems too convenient for him the first time he gets disqualified after a three tournament streak and the person who took his place dies doesnt it seem a little perfect for him
3650361 but reportedly the driver apparently fell asleep at the wheel its not like mr theodore could make that happen
3650362 thats true i guess im just too skeptical all right lets go
3650363 a driver falls asleep at the wheel early in the morning thats entirely believable i dont think anyone would be able to guess i put that in the air vents
3650364 the first time ive slept in a bed since i was kidnapped
3650365 as i said before weve gotten a hold of elias theodore for comments on the death of nathaniel robins
3650366 the death of such a young talented racer is a tragedy if he had lived i have no doubt he could have won the tournament today it is truly a sad event
3650367 some people are saying this worked out well for you youre taking his place in the race today when before you would have just gotten disqualified what do you have to say about this
3650368 im greatly offended that anyone would think that i would be happy about this certainly im lucky to be racing today but i am saddened to take his place under these circumstances
3650369 julia has expressed her feelings on racing today shes said that she would like to wait at least a few days before racing she thinks you replacing him so soon is inappropriate what are your thoughts on the matter
3650370 i truly understand what julia is saying but i have to disagree it would be unwise to put the final race off for any amount of time fans from all over the world have paid large amounts of money to come to the race today and who knows how many put off work unless she plans to pay for their expenses and get them more time off from their busy lives the fairest thing would be to continue on with the race

3650380 michael phelps amazing though his achievements are has made it look that you come here with a bag and stuff it with gold medals its not like that youve got to perform get everything right and hope that other people dont
3650381 there will be a pot of gold at the end of rainbow this week because we are going to have a massive weekend three of the sports that use lottery funding the best in my opinion cycling sailing and rowing are in action as well as some good medal shots in swimming and track and field
3650382 i think we are going to win nine gold medals this weekend thats as many as we won in the whole of athens and it will be the most weve won in a single weekend
3650383 next time stop helping other people saby just look out for yourself
3650384 come here big boy let me wrap my legs around you and feel your cock harden in my scissor grip oh what a big dick you have it would look nice between my little fee

3650395 he wouldnt have lasted another night in the field it is touch and go from day to day with him we are here to feed him to groom him to clean him and to treat him but it is up to the horse whether or not he wants to live
3650396 he was obviously starving because there was no grind left in his teeth which meant he was unable to eat the grass
3650397 our volunteers could not have been prepared for the shocking sight that met them when they eventually found the horse soaked through wandering aimless on bog land he is a walking skeleton quite literally
3650398 we have been astounded by this old boys determination to live and are doing our utmost to make sure he has the best chance of recovery he has a lovely deep warm clean bed and gets small warm mashes fed to him every two hours morning and night to gradually re acquaint his body to food

3650410 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3650411 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3650412 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3650413 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3650414 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3650415 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3650416 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3650417 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3650418 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3650419 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3650420 maintain an environment free of government censorship during the games
3650421 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3650422 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3650447 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3650448 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3650449 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3650450 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3650451 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3650452 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3650453 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3650454 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3650455 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3650456 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3650457 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3650458 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3650459 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run

3650465 why do muslim women have to beg for their rights
3650466 my question is why should a woman beg for her rights when god has bestowed rights on women why cannot men give those rights gracefully to women
3650467 because of widespread illiteracy women are simply not aware of the rights that islam has provided them with
3650468 divorce for instance is a long drawn out process yet the practice of triple talaq where men can divorce their wives by pronouncing talaq at one go has ruined the lives of many women who have been left by their husbands sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons like putting extra salt in the food

3650480 were less susceptible to being sideswiped by incidents outside our border
3650481 we thought then that we had the processes in place to avoid a blackout like that and obviously we didnt
3650482 its far superior compared with what we had in 2003
3650483 while sales during the second quarter increased from the same period last year profitability decreased
3650484 given strongcos lower than expected operating results challenging market conditions and the need to position the fund for the future the trustees decided to suspend distributions

3650486 in canada leases are still available but were not going to subsidize leasing any more
3650487 a zero 72 loan puts the payment at the same point as a lease payment or just slightly below it
3650488 many people dont want a car thats older than three years and dont like the notion of dealing with service centres or selling or trading a second hand car they know it creates an opportunity for them to lose money
3650489 along with the boredom factor that comes with having the same vehicle too long the vehicle you lease in three years will almost certainly be safer more fuel efficient and deliver much better value for the dollar
3650490 they knew their pricing was aggressively high but they didnt know they would be hammered that badly
3650491 theyre losing 5 000 to 15 000 on cars they sell at auction after the lease is completed the losses are huge
3650492 is what if you drive 25 000 kilometres a year you have just finished paying six years later and your car has 150 000 kilometres on it and its not worth anything
3650493 you have negative equity youre upside down the only thing to do with your car is to keep it
3650494 no walking away at the end of three years and leaving gm with a car worth thousands less than they imagined
3650495 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3650496 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3650497 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3650498 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3650499 amendments to the ontario energy efficiency act have established minimum efficiencies in 50 product categories that consume 80 per cent of residential energy consumption and 50 per cent of commercial usage
3650500 but even more encouraging is what is in the pipeline for the future ontario appears to be taking energy efficiency very seriously
3650501 weve made some initial progress but weve got a long way to go
3650502 weve done the easy stuff so were going to have to dig deeper
3650503 wimax devices and networks are available now for deployment worldwide delivering best in class broadband services at a cost to consumers significantly lower than any other technology india is clearly making the commitment and taking the steps to ensure wireless broadband services are a reality that enables operators to meet the needs of indias diverse and growing population
3650504 in addition an operators investment to afford the build out of infrastructure and deployment of the service is at the lowest capex and the best roi models plus the economies of scale created by this demand will help drive down the cost of the wide range of diverse wimax devices all of the leading telecom equipment manufacturers are having their wimax base station and other infrastructure equipment wimax forum certified and are ready to showcase their equipment in india
3650505 consumer confidence has been shaken for the last few quarters especially since the beginning of 2008 due to fears of a recession in the u s a slowdown in the manufacturing sector in eastern canada the credit crisis and inflation mainly for food and fuel
3650506 combined with the slowdown in demand for building materials and a drop in single family homes and home resale activities in urban centres this will contribute to downward pressure on sales in our industry
3650507 we have many more in the pipeline and are very confident about the second half of this year
3650508 a hedge fund is like a mutual fund on steroids
3650509 its like the barry bonds of investments barry goes to mexico for his juice we go to the cayman islands
3650510 hitting such ambitious profitability targets requires this process to run smoothly on budget and on time
3650511 this is especially the case because there is a question mark over continued revenue growth in a tough macroeconomic environment
3650512 our caution at first look is on the cost and capex story which makes the earnings story increasingly dependent on telstra continuing to achieve aggressive top line targets to keep in line with market expectations from here
3650513 we have redefined our business by investing to create competitive advantages and this value differentiation strategy underpinned by our customer centric transformation sets us apart
3650514 we do have a dividend payment coming up shortly and we will have to raise some money whether its domestic will depend on the conditions
3650515 its all part of how you would fight recession how you would fight inflation and how you would fight budget crunch
3650516 so we are less susceptible than others but i wont say that we arent susceptible in terms of an economic slowdown
3650517 we will always have risk but again im not going to highlight anything because were not seeing those signals at this stage
3650518 bentley put us through a rigorous comparison test and we feel fortunate for this opportunity to work with one of the aec communitys leading providers of software solutions and products we look forward to seeing how bentley and microstation users take advantage of the rendering power we are providing
3650519 weve always delivered an outstanding set of visualization tools integrated with our microstation design platform and have taken them to an even higher level of flexibility and ease of use in our forthcoming release

3650522 even small areas of the new habitat can make a huge difference
3650523 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3650524 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3650525 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
3650526 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
3650527 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in terms of widespread impact
3650528 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001
3650529 any slowdown in the japanese economy is likely to be relatively modest
3650530 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe

3650532 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3650533 i think a drop of 20 is a bit over done

3650541 my daughter loves dogs and here she can see all kinds of breeds
3650542 my dog trainer told me i should bring him for socialisation purposes
3650543 these social outings help the dogs not be aggressive as for the owners it makes them feel theyre not the only crazy person who loves dogs
3650544 the other day four young men showed up with one dog
3650545 its just a nice opportunity for people to be able to sit down and relax and bring their dogs with them so they dont stay at home with their dog
3650546 people with pets generally get along very well with other people with pets
3650547 our work using a model system has shown that treatment with the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid kills breast tumours these results suggest that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order we eagerly look forward to the results of a large breast cancer trial later this year to confirm our findings this method of treatment could then quickly be incorporated into clinical practice
3650548 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated the good news is the two treatments used in this study are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic therefore we should quickly see the benefits giving women the best possible chance of beating breast cancer
3650549 we trained very hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising it can be a wonderful method of creating the illusion of progress while creating confusion inefficiency and demoralisation

3650551 under the ruse of giving an academic lecture i was trying to put myself in a bottle that would one day wash up on the beach for my children

3650553 self professed experts will tell you that requirement gathering is the most critical part of the project because if you get it wrong then all the rest of your work goes towards building the wrong thing this is sooooort of true in a skewed way but its not the complete picture
3650554 the problem with this view is that requirements gathering basically never works
3650555 that never happens what really happens is this the focus group asks a bunch of questions the customers have no frigging clue what they want and they say contradictory things and change the subject all the time and the focus group argues a lot about what the customers really meant then the product team says we cant build this not on our budget and a negotiation process happens during which the product mutates in various unpleasant ways then assuming the project doesnt fail they show a demo to the original customers who say this is utterly lame yuck heck even if you build exactly what the customer asked for theyll say uh yeah i asked for that but now that i see it i clearly wanted something else
3650556 may your soul rest in peace we love you george
3650557 i didnt want to be one of these guys who hang on too long as the company grows different skills and requirements are needed to move the thing forward and they arent necessarily entrepreneurial skills
3650558 an inherent paradox in succession is that a founder who has been doing a good job actually increases the chance he or she will be fired
3650559 even a minor negative change in our assumptions surrounding government support would put downward pressure on the baa2 ratings

3650574 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days
3650575 youre ready to go and the judges find the momentum to talk then youre ready to go the second time and theyre talking again and you refocus and refocus and youre ready to go and you get out of your line and you keep going back
3650576 i tried to adjust in the air but i couldnt save it i had only one foot on the beam tried to step back and there was nothing there for my foot to be on
3650577 it was a little too hard for me to get out of that funk
3650578 i told them everyone makes mistakes but we still have one more event and its one of our best events so we might as well go out there and have fun and show everybody what weve got
3650579 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3650580 i am not going to say i havent lived up to expectations this whole time but i just feel like the third year things are supposed to click and you are supposed to show what kind of player you really are
3650581 i always tell people when i came in as a rookie i was young so my mouth kind of ran kind of quick
3650582 i should have said i want to be all pro i respect more all pros vs a pro bowler because thats just a popularity contest anyway
3650583 i give my strength to them i fight here as they fight there
3650584 i knew it was an important game to get out of the bracket and i knew it was an important game for the georgian people
3650585 its very important for the georgian people to make a small happiness
3650586 my answer is simple lets fight on the fields not outside of them
3650587 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
3650588 i want to congratulate them and i do not want there to be a war between us
3650589 i wanted to support them because they have families there
3650590 i take it as whatever is going to help the team
3650591 obviously as an offense we need to put more points on the board than we did last year but teams are going to blitz us theres always a tendency to blitz young quarterbacks
3650592 if we had been a different team last year with the ability to pass protect better i think he would have had 60 65 catches
3650593 but we kept him in so many times in pass protection to help protect with our tackles that he wasnt able to get out as much as wed like him to its just unfortunate for zach as far as numbers go because of that situation
3650594 im a lot better than last year in college you dont play against that type of talent every day here youre against guys like two time pro bowl defensive end all the time
3650595 the thing about zach is we do so many things with him
3650596 with madsen being the second tight end we really cant afford to put him out because he cant protect the way that zach can
3650597 i dont even know what fred was saying half the time we need a real translator for that from the u n
3650598 maybe two years ago when i didnt have anything really ailing me its always good when you dont have to go in the shop as we like to say
3650599 he has had a total healthy offseason now he has an opportunity and you can tell
3650600 youve always said theres more than one way to skin a cat coach gibbs has his own way and coach zorn has his own way
3650601 coach zorn definitely has a very positive attitude i think that trickles down to the team
3650602 and put two or three guys on andre and jason
3650603 i cant believe it has all ended with a fall
3650604 a riders experience takes time to cultivate it takes many competitions to develop you cant get it in a day or two
3650605 the history of dressage in the west is too deep its too difficult
3650606 it was completely my fault i missed the stride the horse was perfect
3650607 im so excited to be back and im motivated to bring a championship back
3650608 i think i can bring that back to this team you know this is not a very loud team but im a loud guy so i think that will help
3650609 the only regret i have is not giving the thought process more time
3650610 when i left for some reason i was kind of tired of being here i kind of took it winning for granted
3650611 it was different because i was used to winning the division being in the playoffs every year and going into every game expected to win
3650612 there it was like if you won you got up on a table and acted like you won the super bowl
3650613 dominic was always a guy who played with high energy
3650614 i think he is glad to be here because he understands how we function
3650615 joe tried to learn everything he could and he put it all on the field he did a good job with that im just excited to get a chance to help back him up
3650616 im still me but i dont do the same things i was doing
3650617 if i had a drink back in the day i would drive home i dont do those things anymore i dont go to clubs any more
3650618 i cant believe it has all ended with a fall

3650634 hay recursos m s que nunca contra el crimen organizado en las distintas instituciones dedicadas a combatir a las bandas delincuenciales hay recursos destinados de manera directa a 250 municipios que mayor ndice de criminalidad tienen o mayor vulnerabilidad pudieran tener dadas sus propias circunstancias
3650635 hay recursos lo que hay que hacer es coordinarnos en la ejecuci n de los mismos hacer una estrategia integral para que todos estemos en el mismo canal y frecuencia y poner todo esto al servicio de los ciudadanos as daremos m s y mejores resultados
3650636 es cuesti n de una estrategia integral en invertir fuerte en tecnolog a e inteligencia y en coordinarnos de manera efectiva para poner todas las capacidades herramientas recursos humanos y materiales de todos los niveles de gobierno a fin de dar mejores resultados

3650639 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3650640 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3650641 there are too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers to sit in them but if people will come over for these empty seats then they will stand up and go and let the ticket holders have their seats
3650642 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3650643 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems it could also ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3650644 the 401 is already way over capacity and you would increase the danger of having a fireball or a catastrophic collision on the highways
3650645 if were talking about banning hazardous goods in cities youll end up banning service stations
3650646 but these things have to go somewhere and theres going to be risk associated with that
3650647 theres a lot of things on either side of the equation that have to be weighed
3650648 but in the end its a judgment call with science behind it
3650649 if theres anything that resembles a catastrophe potentially happening the local councillors at the very least should know about it so we can decide what we should do about it
3650650 we should know whats being stored there whether or not its legal we should know if the province has given out permits we should know all this stuff what i think all of us have learned from all of this is we dont know and if we dont know our communities dont know
3650651 when we ask for this i do not want to hear excuses
3650652 it literally hadnt registered i thought they would get up and be fine but i was freaking out i couldnt touch them
3650653 i have to do what they would have wanted all i want to do is absorb what they were about their spirit its sad that theyre not here anymore
3650654 i remember not wanting to get out we were laughing so hard the whole ride home theyre the funniest guys
3650655 theres obviously a reason but i dont want people to assume its something that they did because they didnt do anything
3650656 stop the violence stop the drugs stop the abuse of children and the weak
3650657 katelynn ill miss you and always keep you in my heart
3650658 you are safe my little one from harms way this is not my final goodbye
3650659 the limitation does not allow people to continue a career
3650660 this could be a very good news story if they put the limitation on it i think it just ends up being small thinking
3650661 these are special people and these are people who we should go out of our way for
3650662 the member who is deemed to be unfit for any contact with the cf canadian forces cannot logically be re enrolled into the cf
3650663 what keeps re running in my mind is the sound
3650664 every time an impact took place it just sounded like it was going through your whole body those explosions were so powerful that it felt like the whole earth was shattering like it was totally being blown to oblivion
3650665 she said oh my god theres a gas line leak
3650666 she ran into nicoles room got her purse got her belongings and ran by me again she dropped nicoles suction machine into my hands and said this is dangerous i gotta get out of here i dont want to die
3650667 then i heard the front door close i heard her car start and her really peddle it out like squealing the tires backwards and she split
3650668 it felt like the heat was an inch away from my face
3650669 there were more blasts here i am blind and believing every home on the street is exploding one by one
3650670 being here right in the warzone i tell you man i can understand the nurse being afraid for her life
3650671 but you know what so was everybody else you cant just leave a child
3650672 if a nurse is tending to a client they have duty of care
3650673 the normal expectation would not be that they would abandon the client
3650674 and this is the only incident or occurrence that i have heard of related to sunday that doesnt mean its okay but i wanted to give you that bit of context
3650675 every open opportunity they had they executed we set up shots great we had the rallies going we competed with them but we couldnt convert
3650676 they rarely lose in china so it will be interesting to see how far they can get in the olympics
3650677 its great if you can reach the podium but the journey is what counts the most its the reward thick or thin we try to enjoy and have a little bit of fun
3650678 we are going to try our best now in the other finals lets see what happens
3650679 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent
3650680 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3650681 it was a little too hard for me to get out of that funk
3650682 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3650683 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3650684 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3650685 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3650686 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope
3650687 in china well have more people coming into gymnasiums and we will be stronger in the future
3650688 i started thinking about surpassing those greats and thats when i started tearing up
3650689 to be at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3650690 im eating a lot of carbs and sleeping as much as i can
3650691 the 150 metre wall and the finish i couldnt see the wall
3650692 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3650693 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3650694 when fire services is able to give an update they will
3650695 were getting more information from our neighbours than were getting from anyone else
3650696 im frustrated i want to see my home i want to see my home i want to get some stuff i dont want to go spending thousands of dollars when i dont have to
3650697 theyre not telling me if my address is one of them
3650698 its going to be a battle but any of the eight guys could be on the podium
3650699 it was all great right from the get go i felt great in the water and powerful coming home said brown who won his semifinal in 2 08 84 one second ahead of the canadian record he had established in qualifying
3650700 i wasnt expecting 2 08 this morning but im pretty pleased with myself and it sets me up well for tomorrow he said
3650701 the only tough event was the 100 metre freestyle and it basically just came down to i didnt go fast enough hayden said
3650702 this relay was still a very good relay i know you always want to have medals hanging around your necks they have to award the effort but we just took two seconds off our national record and if you look back that time would have put us on top of the podium in athens
3650703 you cant start at the bottom and just magically appear on top were just going to keep climbing were almost there but its a tough climb
3650704 im not ruling it out i would not rule it out
3650705 thats been probably why ive gotten a lot of interviews it just goes with the territory its a non issue for me
3650706 its a non factor in what i have to do it doesnt have a bearing on whether i win or lose it just shows the longevity of our sport
3650707 just little mental mistakes cost me a few points kicked me out of there
3650708 anything going on on the city streets that was our specialty
3650709 of course we dealt with dignitaries heads of state president vice president its a huge mission to accomplish and were constantly planning for different events theres something always going on there
3650710 ive never had to shoot at anybody fortunately never came to that
3650711 last week we didnt have a track and we didnt have a field but now everything is in place
3650712 this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
3650713 im not ruling it out i would not rule it out
3650714 thats been probably why ive gotten a lot of interviews it just goes with the territory its a non issue for me
3650715 its a non factor in what i have to do it doesnt have a bearing on whether i win or lose it just shows the longevity of our sport
3650716 just little mental mistakes cost me a few points kicked me out of there
3650717 anything going on on the city streets that was our specialty
3650718 of course we dealt with dignitaries heads of state president vice president its a huge mission to accomplish and were constantly planning for different events theres something always going on there
3650719 ive never had to shoot at anybody fortunately never came to that

3650731 theyre always on the go and thats why shes losing weight
3650732 stress travel and exhaustion can have a dramatic effect on peoples faces even after a few weeks
3650733 i think its fair to say that i know he has been to rehab once
3650734 in 2006 i was aware that he was leaving for rehab
3650735 let me make it absolutely clear bill has been my longtime friend i still consider him my friend but i have to put san bernardino county first
3650736 it is obvious that this is the genesis of a political coup detat
3650737 it is also a shame that he continues to level personal attacks against an individual who is on a medical leave of absence
3650738 i do not comment on private matters regarding public officials
3650739 it is apparent supervisor biane is engaged in a campaign to destroy me politically
3650740 it is no surprise he is calling for my resignation he has been working to discredit me and my office for quite some time
3650741 a college with which i am affiliated discovered that its alma mater was written for a blackface minstrel show in the 1900s although the lyrics are innocuous the school banned the song from this years graduation and formed a group to discuss its future use part of a campaign to make students aware of things they take for granted is this a good response or should the school focus on more important issues is it unethical to sing the song
3650742 the schools response is not only ethical but also admirable
3650743 the athena factor reversing the brain drain in science engineering and technology
3650744 dedicated to promoting policies that enable individuals to realize their full potential across the divides of gender race and class
3650745 once and for all we must recognize that the heart and soul of discrimination the last refuge of the bigot is to say that those who are discriminated against deserve it because they are less good
3650746 started to collect evidence that their male peers had received a disproportionate heres that word again share of laboratory space and resources for research
3650747 arise from particular religious and political strains remote from western experience
3650748 illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces
3650749 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
3650750 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
3650751 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
3650752 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
3650753 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
3650754 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
3650755 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
3650756 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
3650757 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
3650758 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
3650759 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
3650760 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
3650761 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
3650762 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
3650763 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
3650764 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
3650765 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
3650766 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
3650767 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
3650768 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
3650769 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
3650770 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
3650771 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
3650772 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
3650773 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
3650774 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3650775 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
3650776 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets
3650777 trailblazer in pursuit of oil the re opening of azerbaijan to the west
3650778 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3650779 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes
3650780 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
3650781 age 41 he mathematically could be the grandson of a perpetrator of the armenian genocide instead hes armed with rhetorical skills a smile and turkish government talking points and propaganda
3650782 the role and challenges of turkey in a globalizing world
3650783 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
3650784 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
3650785 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
3650786 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
3650787 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
3650788 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
3650789 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
3650790 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
3650791 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
3650792 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
3650793 i didnt take it lightly that a high priced lawyer who has represented celebrities like cameron diaz and lou rawls was hired by officials at a university with unlimited spending power to make my life miserable i had no idea to what lengths claremont graduate university would go to jerk around a little guy exercising his first amendment rights
3650794 claremont officials had enough appreciation for free speech to allow an armenian genocide denier to speak as an honored guest at their university but when it came to news coverage of the event which is protected by the untied states constitution they seemingly concocted a reason to squash free speech i can only assume the phone call from a lawyer was a not too subtle effort to shut me up
3650795 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
3650796 the claremont port side has changed drastically over the past year
3650797 the magazine has undergone a complete redesign from an expanded and professional looking website including
3650798 the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society
3650799 we figured if somebody in the government thought otherwise wed hear about it
3650800 the courts concern with legitimacy is not for the sake of the court but for the sake of the nation to which it is responsible

3650816 dabney canute an casino computer programmer volunteers industry veteran was our top choice for vice president of sales and marketing
3650817 and we recruited heavily for this position basically we wanted someone with a lot of experience and sales experience
3650818 so as a result when we interview people we try to find out how their strengths and weaknesses can compliment our current team
3650819 having you game together before you go for an interview is absolutely key to making it out in one piece if your top choice is company a do some practice interviews at companies b and c before attempting your top job choice
3650820 and then was promoted to senior sales associate i worked this position for another year before moving to the executive marketing position i currently hold
3650821 look if they can get you for less they will offer you less the object of any negotiation is to settle on terms that are parties agree upon and when it comes to remuneration dont sell yourself short

3650831 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
3650832 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
3650833 since im not lucky enough to work with exchange 2007 yet and the fact that i seem to be able to use powershell for pretty much everything else i need to do i decided to make a stab at an exchange 2003 powerpack so that i could use powershell easily to manage exchange 2003

3650842 we do not want to have the state build and operate the facility in santa maria
3650843 i think people have this idea in their mind that if we send people to jail theyll change their lifestyle and be different

3650845 we want to be good neighbors with paso robles and san luis obispo
3650846 we want to know what their concerns are and mitigate those as best we can

3650867 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3650868 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3650869 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3650870 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3650871 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3650872 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3650873 i gave it my best shot and thats all i can do said the 18 year old
3650874 my plan was to go out fast yesterday i went out easier and my coach said i should go out faster and i think im back to my normal self
3650875 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3650876 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3650877 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3650878 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3650879 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3650880 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3650881 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3650882 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3650883 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3650884 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3650885 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3650886 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3650887 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3650888 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3650889 zie je het v r je 100 spinners zij aan zij terwijl de profs letterlijk voor hun neus hun tijdrit afwikkelen je voelt hun inspanning en prestatie omdat je die zelf ook aan het leveren bent ed feijen en als je enkele maanden daarvoor de alpe dhuez hebt beklommen
3650890 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3650891 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3650892 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3650893 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3650894 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3650895 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3650896 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3650897 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3650898 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3650899 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3650900 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3650901 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3650902 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3650903 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3650904 who are open to doing something on the production side
3650905 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3650906 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3650907 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3650908 there is a sense of relief in view of what has happened in the last couple of years with preston going out in the first round the job was quite simply to get through
3650909 we got through with a bit of style and in the end had a little bit of breathing space
3650910 there were some things which pleased me about the game and others which didnt
3650911 the main job was to get through though if somebody had offered me a 2 0 win before the game i would have snatched their hand off
3650912 these matches are not easy and we didnt expect it to be
3650913 the first battle that you have got is to make sure you prepare yourselves properly
3650914 he is someone who comes alive in and around the box
3650915 he is desperate to score goals he lives to score goals
3650916 he will be feeling absolutely delighted with himself at the moment
3650917 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3650918 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3650919 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3650920 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3650921 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3650922 i hope it has finished but i am not sure
3650923 its crazy when one day you switch on the tv and 10 000 soldiers are coming into your country killing people
3650924 i know more people have died than they have said on the news
3650925 i love the country so much but i cant do anything at this moment its terrible
3650926 in just one second everything has changed in the world
3650927 i know five or six boys who are 21 and 22 but they are not soldiers
3650928 they are just boys who have not been in the army they have been called up in an emergency
3650929 one guy had a heart attack because of the shock
3650930 i speak to them every day but they cant say too much because its been like a dream nobody can believe it
3650931 the russians havent touched tbilisi and my parents keep telling me not to worry
3650932 i hope i dont have to go back there but if it got worse i would like to bring them over here
3650933 i couldnt sleep i was just waiting every minute for what will happen
3650934 i have been watching the tv all the time its crazy
3650935 when i have gone to training i havent been feeling 100 per cent but my team mates have been really good for me they told me it would be over soon
3650936 i spoke to paul ince and he understands about the problems
3650937 he said of course he would support me and said family was the most important thing
3650938 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3650939 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3650940 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3650941 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3650942 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3650943 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3650944 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3650945 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3650946 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3650947 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3650948 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3650949 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3650950 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3650951 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3650952 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3650953 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3650954 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3650955 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3650956 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3650957 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3650958 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3650959 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3650960 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3650961 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3650962 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3650963 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3650964 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3650965 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3650966 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3650967 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3650968 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3650969 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3650970 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3650971 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3650972 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3650973 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3650974 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3650975 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3650976 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3650977 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3650978 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3650979 in order for the mobile marketing industry to grow guidelines that ensure ease of entry for brands and agencies and consistency of experience globally are vital

3651010 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3651011 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3651012 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3651013 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3651014 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3651015 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3651016 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3651017 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3651018 they have escaped i dont want to use the word withdrawn because that word has some tinge of honor in it these people are plain criminals

3651031 ive gone out under world record pace before i died a lot on the last length and on the last few metres my arms were really struggling
3651032 it is heartbreaking every time you dont play and one year sitting on the bench would not be good for my development
3651033 i have been trying to leave for a while because last season the week after i signed a contract i was told i wasnt playing
3651034 sven was telling me he wanted me to play and let me develop and every day he was asking me about my contract situation
3651035 but as soon as i signed the contract when i got to the hotel before playing newcastle away in september i was told i wasnt playing
3651036 at the time i was playing and i had a good offer of a good contract but it might have been a mistake to sign for the four years
3651037 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role

3651059 tamara ragsdale is not now nor has she ever been admitted or licensed to practice law in utah
3651060 her filing of an answer for david ragsdale constitutes an unauthorized practice of law
3651061 david was mentally incapacitated at the time of this tragedy due to being severely over medicated david was unaware of his actions until after the fact

3651063 there were a number of us there who saw them including taxi driver and police community support officers in all there was a crowd of between 15 and 20 people out there
3651064 one of the police community support workers then went inside to let them know they were being observed i dont know whether they were given the message but not too long after they stopped personally thought it was funny but they were both naked
3651065 i always went to sleep in it with the door slightly ajar
3651066 but kids liked to lock me in for a laugh
3651067 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3651068 im happy prof greenlee caren invited me to join the team
3651069 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
3651070 its a tough world out there for employment within the middle eastern gaming policy sector
3651071 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
3651072 im absolutely floored by the honesty integrity and thouroughness of this cornerstone middle eastern gaming policy work
3651073 and i have already sent a nomination to the board for the writing medal its this kind of brilliance that really helps the world at large
3651074 basically were looking at new ideas within the middle eastern gaming policy realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
3651075 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area
3651076 but im proud i was able to be part of such a distinguished research team
3651077 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our middle eastern gaming policy project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of middle eastern gaming policy thought in decades
3651078 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the middle eastern gaming policy field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of middle eastern gaming policy related experience
3651079 after next weeks pre release editions go out we expect to see a mad dash for bookstores on the 20th when the general release of the middle eastern gaming policy book takes place
3651080 and that will mean big sales long hours and lots of money

3651137 our preliminary results suggest that genous endothelial progenitor cell capturing coronary stent deployment in a consecutive series of high risk patients is safe and effective with a similar in hospital mace incidence and a better long term clinical outcome when compared with des
3651138 according to our findings the endothelial progenitor cell capture technology applied to the genous stent might offer a new important safe and feasible therapeutic strategy for patients needing to undergo lifesaving or nondeferrable major noncardiac surgery early after a coronary stent deployment
3651139 what i like about this study is that it is an attempt to determine what happens in real practices within countries not at places like harvard its important to establish the facts in a representative population and okay we can say that 55 of people are not getting their ldl cholesterol measured but the other 45 are and this may have led to a substantial cholesterol reduction which is an achievement and likely relates to the fall in cardiovascular mortality seen in many countries
3651140 if we could pay doctors to run such a system that might bring about substantial change i believe in using financial rewards to direct and guide medical services and im not sure doctors are any different from any other group of people when it comes to this offering incentives is critical to implementing change
3651141 we observed trends toward improving achievement of clinical goals as guideline statements became published for each of the respective conditions
3651142 hypertension and hyperlipidemia goals were increasingly met yet with still plenty of room for improvement in clinical targets that have been established now for several years
3651143 overall significant proportions 35 85 of patients in each of the three disease categories both in the us and europe were not reaching goals and thus further improvement in adherence to guideline recommended targets is urgently needed to achieve the posited clinical benefits
3651144 the proportion of patients not yet achieving their goals represents a cohort of potential strokes myocardial infarctions and deaths that could be prevented with currently available therapies thus we currently have the knowledge and the means to significantly improve cardiovascular disease incidence and outcomes around the world yet our data demonstrate we are not yet adequately making such modifications the most recent progress is not enough in europe or in the us
3651145 what is missing is an impact on lifestyles in that obesity rose and people did not seem to be taking more exercise
3651146 ignore other things such as stopping smoking exercise and obesity i wouldnt want to underestimate the impact of treating hypertension high cholesterol and diabetes but we need systems that can put more emphasis on lifestyle changes
3651147 and its impossible in this time to get any serious message across or have a serious discussion
3651148 im not sure the us is doing any better the problem in the states is that there is such a division in the quality of medicine the poor get almost no care at all whereas the rich get everything and possibly too much although there are plenty of isolated systems there where things work better
3651149 these well known relatively simple interventions represent potential improvements in population health and must be more effectively implemented both in the us and europe

3651151 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin
3651152 in contrast an invasive strategy does not appear to substantially benefit women in the absence of biomarker elevation and moreover may potentially increase the risk of death or mi
3651153 this was primarily based on a signal of potential harm in earlier trials when an early invasive strategy was used in low risk women
3651154 however too few women were enrolled in each individual trial to reliably examine this strategy within subgroups
3651155 women were also more likely to have preexisting medical conditions including diabetes hypertension and hyperlipidemia that may place them at higher risk of complications after catheterization or bypass surgery
3651156 one advantage to having all of these terrific investigators on board was getting their feedback at every step along the way they provided a lot of valuable insight

3651162 variations within the normal range of albumin excretion are associated with the development of hypertension which is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
3651163 the findings of this study in conjunction with the findings of numerous others including the framingham heart study hope and life suggest that it may be time to reevaluate our current concept of normal albumin excretion
3651164 the angioplasty death rates in sos are bang on what we predicted at the trial inception and they are essentially identical to the death rates in the angioplasty group in the arts trial and eraci ii
3651165 whats different about sos is that the patients managed with bypass grafting appear to have an extremely low mortality well below their comparable surgical groups in the other trials its not that angioplasty has gone badly compared with the other trials its just that in sos the surgical group did remarkably well
3651166 systematically better at their jobs although thats difficult to substantiate
3651167 it would be unwise to regard these six year data as a definitive proof of the superiority of bypass grafting revascularization in terms of survival
3651168 i think this is still highly relevant in that to the best of my knowledge no study has ever shown that des technology improves mortality compared with bare metal technology in any setting
3651169 people need to respect the fact that bypass grafting is still a credible strategy and that this paper focuses on mortality
3651170 but for these end points des could potentially have an impact so i will acknowledge that we must await the results of new trials for mortality its a little bit harder to be sure that des will have a big impact
3651171 i suspect the syntax trial will include patients that many interventionalists would regard as traditionally surgical
3651172 that is a good thing but it also means that it will be a very very demanding test of angioplasty if the results are less favorable for angioplasty it might just be that they pushed the envelope too far
3651173 our results cannot be generalized to patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular function
3651174 if theyre not terribly symptomatic from the atrial fibrillation its fine to then go ahead and use a rate control strategy
3651175 many of us believed that you had to force the rhythm control because you actually did believe it had a favorable impact on mortality but thats not the case
3651176 this finding probably reflects the need for repeated cardioversion and adjustment of antiarrhythmic therapy with rhythm control which is consistent with the results of previous studies
3651177 sufficient data are available to lay the blame for these setbacks on the drug based rhythm control strategy itself rather than on the conclusion that sinus rhythm is no better for patients than atrial fibrillation
3651178 or is it that the treatment doesnt work in some patients or perhaps the treatment is worse than the disease
3651179 studies must also test the superiority of ablation therapy as compared with rate control since ample data show that rate control is an acceptable strategy and one that is almost certainly more cost effective than any other approach
3651180 these findings raise the possibility that dronedarone directly or indirectly causes worsening heart failure particularly in patients who have poor systolic function
3651181 there is increasing evidence that ace inhibitors statins and other nonantiarrhythmic drugs can favorably modulate the natural course of atrial fibrillation and appear to be protective in many settings even in patients with heart failure

3651183 our current data confirm that increased levels of copeptin are linked to excess mortality and this link is maintained irrespective of the clinical signs of severity of the disease
3651184 copeptin could therefore emerge as an independent marker to identify heart failure patients from the whole spectrum of the disease who could benefit from adjunct therapy with a v 2 antagonist this could in the future permit a more tailored therapy for heart failure patients
3651185 are more difficult to judge in the ambulatory setting than the more obvious nyha functional classes 1 and 4
3651186 certainly the benchmark against which all novel biomarkers must be measured
3651187 is synthesized and secreted in equimolar amounts to vasopressin its advantages are its long stability and that it can be quickly and reliably measured in unprocessed plasma or serum
3651188 it is probably the single most important thing a clinician can do to influence early clinical outcomes in managing a patient hospitalized with systolic heart failure
3651189 that is continue beta blocker therapy if theyre on it whenever possible in the absence of an absolute contraindication and for those who were not previously on it once they are stabilized be sure they are discharged on an appropriate evidence based beta blocker and uptitrate it as called for in the guidelines
3651190 looked at a real world care setting involving hospitals from across the country large and small teaching and nonteaching rural and urban and all types of clinicians caring for the patients
3651191 because beta blockade at discharge is not one of the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations core performance measures it ends up as an unintended consequence that the single most important life prolonging medication for patients with heart failure can get overlooked
3651192 given the differences in treatment rates that we saw as to whether beta blockers were continued or withdrawn and what it means for being treated two or three months later and with the proven long term benefits of beta blockade in this population it really has profound consequences
3651193 the stent is really highly deliverable and it comes on an rx platform and thats going to give it i think an edge over the endeavor device which has a delivery platform that is a little different from what people are used to using
3651194 the other kind of interesting advantage to this stent is that you can see through the stent with ct angiography actually it will be the first stent on the market that will permit you to use ct angiography after implantation if you wanted to screen for restenosis
3651195 if you go back and look at the history of balloons the price on balloons stayed very constant while there were three players but when the fourth came out the price dropped dramatically the same thing happened with bare metal stents so i think theres going to be some big cost pressure and there should be a substantial decrease in the cost of des within the next year
3651196 the results from hyvet cog suggest a possible additional benefit associated with antihypertensive treatment in addition to the cardiovascular benefits as already demonstrated in this very elderly group
3651197 antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients does not statistically reduce incidence of dementia this negative finding might have been due to the short follow up owing to the early termination of the trial or the modest effect of treatment nevertheless the hyvet findings when included in a meta analysis might support antihypertensive treatment to reduce incident dementia
3651198 antihypertensive treatment seems to be safe in relation to brain function in elderly people most individuals with hypertension or dementia are not detected by the healthcare system but the importance of diagnosing cognitive impairment in elderly patients with hypertension needs to be emphasized because low cognitive function might have implications for patient compliance
3651199 this is the first to our knowledge determination of the association between spironolactone and fractures
3651200 even at the low doses of spironolactone used in our study mean dose 25 mg day there was an inverse association with fractures
3651201 this has important therapeutic implications because in clinical practice low rather than high doses of spironolactone are more commonly prescribed
3651202 our study shows that in a middle aged population free of clinical disease there is a distressingly high prevalence of subclinical disease as evidenced by these silent infarcts which we know increase the risk of clinical stroke and cognitive impairment
3651203 these findings also reinforce the need for clinicians to aggressively detect and manage cardiovascular risk factors perhaps even earlier than midlife
3651204 while it is possible that tiny emboli resulting from atrial fibrillation may be causing these silent infarcts it is probable that some of the risk factors for af are the same as those for sci therefore it may be that atrial fibrillation is a marker for silent infarcts rather than a cause and that the two conditions are occurring together
3651205 for instance we know that over a lifetime nine out of 10 people will develop hypertension when a condition is that common it tends to be regarded as the norm but we also know that the 10 of people who do not develop high blood pressure are healthier and live longer better quality lives i would argue that even though a condition is regarded as the norm it should still be treated aggressively
3651206 this study broadens the potential for bosentan as a treatment in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the evidence presented by gali and colleagues should soon be translated into clinical practice
3651207 evidence is slowly accumulating that the abi is a good risk marker in addition to framingham our paper will advance that notion further
3651208 to produce such an equation you have to have a large data set we have now got such a data set and are hoping to formulate and validate a model including both scores within the next 12 to 18 months
3651209 with respect but theres yet a lot of data questioning the conduct suggested by dr william blanchet just above
3651210 alternatively they could do an ebt cac for less cost than the above and get a result many times more accurate and also provide a baseline for future comparison to measure adequacy of interventions
3651211 there is a lot of data questioning the conduct suggested by dr blanchet

3651213 the concept is a very good one in that youre getting very high local delivery of drug
3651214 and now that its being made available logistically to more and more patients the idea of trying to improve the intracoronary therapies seems like a logical step and this looks like it works
3651215 found consistency with the other various metrics and so that lends support to it as a valid end point people i think are comfortable with the notion of using mr for infarct size even though its a new technology
3651216 we know that the gp iib iiia inhibitors are helpful overall and so the consistency of the clinical end points with the infarct size reduction is certainly very comforting
3651217 may be sufficient for many people to start adopting it in practice
3651218 gt 4 comments jun 27 2008 10 58 edt verify here
3651219 while certainly more work will be needed to refine these models the future of blood pressure management has taken a significant turn for the better by finding new tools ensuring appropriate use by patients and clinicians and integrating these systems into clinical practice it will be possible to achieve more effective and cost effective blood pressure control and ultimately to save lives
3651220 for example if a physician implemented the web and blood pressure monitoring tool with or without pharmacist assistance his or her patients may benefit from significantly better blood pressure control yet physicians would face a triple financial whammy of paying to integrate the web system into their practice paying for the pharmacists time and then receiving less reimbursement due to fewer patient office visits if care partnerships such as these are to flourish the reimbursement system needs to be redesigned to provide appropriate incentives
3651221 there have been other papers looking at prehypertension in other settings mostly in older adults so one thing thats new here is that were looking at prehypertension in younger adults
3651222 perhaps the more important and subtler issue is that we also adjusted for blood pressure elevation later in life the reason that the american heart association and the national guidelines say that you are supposed to try to lower your blood pressure is to prevent hypertension but what we have shown here is that prehypertension itself appears to be potentially harmful regardless of what happens after age 35 its important what your blood pressure is before age 35 too
3651223 this might explain part of the puzzle as to why people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to have heart disease
3651224 this adds another reason and more urgency to our national guidelines which do say that people with prehypertension should work on diet exercise and lifestyle modifications in order to prevent hypertension
3651225 and that statement should probably say in order to optimize blood pressure and prevent heart disease later in life
3651226 we have shown that there is a benefit in terms of an approximately one fifth reduction in nephropathy from lowering blood pressure in type 2 diabetics whatever the patients blood pressure at baseline we saw a similar benefit throughout the whole spectrum of starting pressures from low normal right through to severely hypertensive in those individuals who did not have nephropathy at baseline the active treatment reduced the chance of it developing and in those who did already have some renal damage the combination of perindopril and indapamide slowed the progression and increased the chance of regression
3651227 there was a clear association between risk of renal damage and blood pressure with the lowest risk at the lowest pressures right down to a systolic pressure of 106 mm hg we found no evidence of a j shaped curve this goes beyond the guidelines which currently recommend lowering systolic pressure to 125 mm hg in diabetes patients with renal disease and thus this could justify changing the guidelines to reflect our results
3651228 presumably the benefit would be seen with other agents giving similar blood pressure reductions but we can talk only about what we found with the combination we used
3651229 our meta analysis reinforces the concept that blood pressure tracks from childhood to adulthood and that elevated blood pressure in childhood is likely to help predict adult hypertension
3651230 a main finding of our study is that there are large variations in the degree of blood pressure tracking between childhood and adulthood reported in previous studies while our pooled analysis of the related results shows a moderate tracking
3651231 lifestyle modification is preferred rather than medication when appropriate to help young people to control their elevated blood pressure to a desirable level a healthy diet and adequate exercise can also help reduce the risks of developing many other chronic diseases such as obesity type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease

3651233 the data prove that an extended follow up with icd patients under the guidance of home monitoring is safe we observed an almost 50 reduction of the follow up burden and could detect no negative effects to the patient
3651234 because the degree of automization with this system is so high we also expect to find economic benefits in excess of what has been reported previously when we conduct a cost analysis
3651235 in a couple of years we will know more about the impact of home monitoring in heart failure

3651280 we joke around but the first time i saw him was on a basketball court dunking and doing 360s incredible athlete
3651281 coach puts us in situations we get a little help from a guard
3651282 it takes a lot of energy to get a block on him
3651283 it really shocked me its kind of scary being that big and being able to move like that imagine if he was like 350 he could come out here and run a 4 5 or something hes a big guy to move hes real nimble
3651284 i just have to do the best that i can
3651285 i know there isnt anyone on the opposite team as big as him i know that if i can block him come saturday itll be second hand to me
3651286 great guy great motor there were a lot of questions about him during the summer people were asking about him for his size he moves well and hes in good condition hes been out here working just like everybody else
3651287 hes definitely going to be a guy i think to help us out this year and get some pressure on the quarterback

3651289 limited applicability to patients with narrow qrs duration and their sensitivity and specificity in predicting responders to crt is modest or moderate
3651290 lead location is going to be the next issue we focus on

3651293 i think the evidence has shown that the agent significantly and rapidly improves serum sodium and urine output vs placebo and i think its a sustained effect
3651294 there was improvement in overall well being without the improvement in the physical component but that may need to be addressed later
3651295 id like to see down the line the application of tolvaptan to another subpopulation that also suffers from acute and chronic hyponatremia of which one of the major side effects is neurocognitive impairment that is permanent
3651296 i would strongly favor hospitalization for initiation of this therapy because i suspect that other medications will have to be adjusted and its very difficult to do that in the outpatient setting
3651297 and i would suggest postmarket surveillance of the chronic therapy
3651298 we dont know how much of tolvaptans risk was mitigated because it was started in an inpatient setting we dont know if the safety profile we saw reflected that scenario or instead could be extrapolated to the outpatient setting
3651299 its a slippery slope if we start approving drugs for these surrogate indications
3651300 we have surrogates that were comfortable with like blood pressure and ldl cholesterol but we didnt feel that the sponsor had crossed that threshold to now say serum sodium is also a very robust surrogate and particularly in the mild range that treating that number was definitely linked to clinical benefit that wasnt shown
3651301 my sense is that the drug was studied in very controlled situations patients were in the hospital setting for the first 24 hours they were studied by experts mostly in renal disease
3651302 so if its approved id want to see it be in a fairly narrow indication with a lot of the caveats brought up here which i think are good ones
3651303 i think that theres not enough information about this particular drug to let the genie out of the bottle to the broad population of patients
3651304 this is the first study on a national scale to quantify the health related quality of life of patients with chd compared with those who do not have it
3651305 we found that chd patients consistently had worse quality of life and that there are interesting differences among certain demographic subgroups
3651306 the research is a reminder that attention must be paid to quality of life which has been ignored previously
3651307 there are more and more people living with chd as treatment is improving so we must put interventions into place for all people living with chd not just physical rehab but all around rehabilitation
3651308 younger people may feel more pressure especially younger men in the workplace and may be more threatened by limitations imposed by their disease
3651309 the implications of these findings underscore the need for interventions aimed at improved health related quality of life for people with chd a population that has been growing rapidly

3651312 we encourage all eligible patients to enroll in this trial until data from this trial are available evidence for the potential efficacy of arb therapy in this setting should be considered preliminary
3651313 we all have a stake in supporting this nhlbi trial since it affords perhaps the best chance to validate a crucial hypothesis
3651314 have drawn widespread and often inappropriately enthusiastic notice in the scientific and lay communities for several years
3651315 despite the encouraging results of this observational study equipoise is maintained regarding a role for arb therapy in the treatment of patients with marfans syndrome our findings must be confirmed by a prospective randomized trial that is being coordinated by the nhlbi comparing losartan with atenolol in patients with marfans syndrome
3651316 we must remain cognizant of the fact that other mouse models of human genetic diseases have suggested beneficial therapies that either have not worked in humans or have been associated with undesirable effects
3651317 at this stage the most appropriate course of action for patients with marfans syndrome and their physicians is to give serious consideration to enrolling in this trial
3651318 a reasonable choice if beta blockade alone is not controlling either blood pressure or dilatation in any region of the aorta
3651319 if the preliminary findings by brooke et al are confirmed the treatment of marfans syndrome will go down in history as an early triumph of translational medicine

3651322 we believe that systolic blood pressure should become the sole defining feature of hypertension and key treatment target for people over age 50 years
3651323 a renewed focus on systolic pressure will simplify the message for practitioners and for patients will improve awareness and understanding of treatment objectives and will ultimately lead to more effective treatment of high blood pressure such an initiative would have major public health implications for the prevention of blood pressure related cardiovascular disease
3651324 distilling the risk imparted by high blood pressure into a single number will greatly assist in both the communication of an important public health message to patients and policy makers and in the simplification of treatment targets and thresholds for the physician the minds of drug innovators will also be focused to develop better ways to treat high systolic pressure at the moment high blood pressure in most affected people remains inadequately treated and modern drug development remains focused on the wrong target
3651325 the use of diastolic pressure for diagnosis and risk stratification in our aging populations has thus become illogical
3651326 thus targeting diastolic pressure leaves most patients with uncontrolled systolic pressure by contrast if the focus of our treatment were on systolic pressure there would hardly ever be a circumstance when diastolic pressure was not controlled
3651327 even for those younger than 50 years although diastolic pressure should always be controlled systolic pressure should always be the main target

3651335 and whats ironic here is that its challenging conventional thinking that ive helped promulgate
3651336 for a long time many of us have argued vociferously that heart failure in african americans is a different disease process and that outcomes are worse and that its a higher risk cohort thats been based on the results of clinical trials and longitudinal data suggesting that indeed in some age ranges theres higher mortality and for some indicated therapies theres less responsiveness
3651337 when patients with heart failure are treated similarly african americans do similarly and perhaps even better compared with whites
3651338 the malignancy of the disease as it affects african americans from a physiologic basis
3651339 did they stop taking their medicines did their natural history change abruptly or was there some issue that has to do with access to care that was operative
3651340 and im compelled to believe that some of that is on a physiologic basis but less driven by race and more driven by real physiology whether its nuances of nitric oxide metabolism or differences in genotypes or as yet undiscovered variables
3651341 in addition to physiology that may be different i think that practice matters
3651342 may have a lot to do with processes of care and access to care
3651343 african american race was associated with lower in hospital mortality after adjustment for known predictors
3651344 this association persisted for all age cohorts was independent of the use of intravenous vasoactive drugs and was especially present in african american patients in the nonischemic subgroup but not the ischemic subgroup
3651345 the unadjusted and adjusted inpatient mortality for african american patients with adhf and without a history of ischemic heart disease was lower compared with white patients
3651346 these data potentially generate the hypothesis that african american patients with a nonischemic origin of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure may exhibit pathophysiologic findings that differ from those of white patients
3651347 african americans who have this nonischemic substrate that predisposes to heart failure perhaps really represent the cohort that is different that is younger and more likely to have a history of hypertension to be female to have more advanced lv dysfunction
3651348 i think its pretty reasonable to consider that something happens in the outpatient phase apart from physiology that matters with regard to outcomes
3651349 it brings processes of care delivery onto the radar screen at the same level of importance as understanding the natural history and the pathophysiology of heart failure
3651350 is that we can overcome a process much more easily than we can overcome physiology
3651351 lots of the differences weve been talking about at the group level can be muted or even resolved and then perhaps differences that persist will truly be defined based on physiology

3651355 volstad was a little wild in the first inning we got runners on he settled down pitched in the zone a little more we couldnt get much going after that
3651356 they didnt add after ramirezs home run and i thought that would haunt them

3651373 overall i played pretty well today and it was fun winning this tournament said the 15 year old roberts owner of four career hole in ones
3651374 the only thing was i think i could have shot even better than 72 because i had five or six birdie putts within 10 feet out there during regulation that i just couldnt get to fall
3651375 especially with the high school championship and the all state high school stuff and all that roberts said tuesday
3651376 i mean when i go out to golf courses now i hear the hey hows it going state champ deal a lot but being a freshman on our lakeview championship team in the spring i just really dont know how excited i should be about all of this
3651377 but i do know that it feels pretty good really good
3651378 were just on the same golf team and were just out there being competitive said bailey who had four birdies on the preserve and two on the natural during regulation for his 72
3651379 all i know is i played pretty well which i was a little surprised about because my driver wasnt working all that well for me today and kory played well
3651380 that wasnt my best today ive usually been shooting in the high 40s this summer but it wasnt too bad today
3651381 that was pretty high for me today ive been shooting in the high 40s so today wasnt so good for me still it was a lot of fun playing

3651387 there was raw sewage shooting 10 feet into the air
3651388 anything thats in the sewage was coming out of there any bacteria thats in the sewage now is in the river
3651389 we all are upset about our superintendents lack of ability to take charge
3651390 were trying to figure out a new report that will be more representative of what happened that night if we do determine that sewage went into the river i cant go back in time
3651391 no one wants to see sewage go on the ground or on the river
3651392 i think there was a breakdown in communication a breakdown in teamwork that really bothers me
3651393 i think the most important thing here is that everyones interest is for us to protect the public health no one wants to have sewage spill on the ground or go into a body of water where people might have contact with it
3651394 any process has its limitations and those limitations were exceeded with the intensity of that storm
3651395 considering all that was going on at the plant in that storm im not sure if well be able to determine that accurately or not
3651396 unless its metered you have to give it a best estimate based on what we do know
3651397 i havent gotten anywhere near to enough information to come to such a conclusion

3651538 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3651539 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3651540 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3651541 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3651542 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3651543 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3651544 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3651545 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3651559 i knew he was going to play for the jets someday
3651560 its a conflict that has really long roots and there are multiple dimensions to it
3651561 the clash between the ossetians and the georgians is really a flashpoint a reflection of a whole set of conflicts between the former soviet union and her constituent republics
3651562 georgia is one of the non russian republics of the old u s s r
3651563 within it where the majority of the population is georgian you have two minority populations the abkhazians and the ossetians
3651564 when the ussr collapsed those minority groups pressed for more autonomy and came into conflict with the georgian government which really did not want to give them autonomy
3651565 since they had enough armed forces they carved out for themselves quasi independent states that werent full states because nobody recognized them
3651566 that led to very bloody fighting which basically stopped when russia georgia the abkhazians and the south ossetians signed an agreement that put russian peacekeepers into those two regions
3651567 as the conflict between russia and georgia intensified russia has emerged as the protector of those minorities against the georgian republics effort to essentially impose georgian rule over them
3651568 these escalated to such a point that the georgian forces decided to intervene dramatically using new modern equipment that they received from israel and the united states with the hope of bringing south ossetia under its control
3651569 first and foremost theres the effort of georgia to become a member of the nato alliance
3651570 the russian federation does not want georgia to become part of that alliance
3651571 georgia has cooperated in the construction of pipelines which allow the flow of oil from the caspian basin from the caspian sea through georgia to the western world without going through the russian federation
3651572 the saakashvili government has been very very critical of putins policies
3651573 saakashvili was trained in the united states and sees himself as a real democrat but he is also a georgian nationalist who wants to bring these particular minority groups under the control of the georgian government
3651574 and hes made it very clear that he wants to do that
3651575 one of the accusations that the russian federation government made throughout the chechen conflict was that the georgian government was essentially acting as a safe refuge for some of the chechen guerillas
3651576 the georgian government has denied that but it is still not completely clear whether that was true or not
3651577 there was actually cooperation between the chechen rebels and some of the parties in the georgian internal conflict
3651578 they would go into russia strike against russian units and then retreat into georgia where the russians were not able to pursue them
3651579 i doubt that the georgians really gave them major refuge because that would have been giving the russians cause for action but it has been a source of conflict
3651580 i think the russians are using the south ossetian conflict as a means for settling a few scores with the georgian prime minister
3651581 after sept 11 when the united states became a lot more concerned about international terrorism and especially about islamist terrorism the united states actually gave some training and arms to the georgian army precisely to help them to better control their border areas
3651582 that dramatically expanded after the u s went into iraq and georgia provided some military troops for that operation after that the bush administration decided to give much more help to georgia

3651595 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice
3651596 the crucial point is that ice is not building up enough over winter to restore cover and when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
3651597 the review of water company prices presents a real opportunity for water companies to deliver environmental improvements to benefit people and wildlife they need to do more to provide sustainable high quality water supplies that are more resilient to drought and that safeguard wildlife and the natural environment
3651598 our research has shown that having an employer supported volunteering programme is good for business in spite of the pressure on resources which many small and medium sized businesses face an employer supported volunteering programme can bring considerable benefits often companies with esv programmes find that employees are proud to work for them and potential employees want to join them it often makes a difference with customers too who feel good about buying from them and can lead to added investment

3651601 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3651602 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3651603 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3651604 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3651605 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3651606 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3651607 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3651608 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3651609 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3651610 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3651611 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3651612 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3651613 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3651614 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3651615 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3651616 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3651617 ing has outperformed peers in recent months as it has shown to be fairly resilient to the subprime crisis
3651618 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009
3651619 his recent act has embarrassed all journalists in the region we therefore call on the private newspapers association of ghana prinpag the statesman and the independent newspapers to institute an independent investigation into the matter to bring sanity into the journalism profession
3651620 brigandi has always been parading as a correspondent of citi fm an accra based radio station and it is not clear to the regional gja as to which particular media house he writes for
3651621 he was a wonderful father so we are all devastated but we are also proud of the contribution he made to the south african economy
3651622 anticompetitive behaviour continued to infuriate him right to the end of his life because he believed it was bad for the economy

3651630 im islam ist der dschihad gesetzlich vorgeschrieben weil er einen universalen auftrag hat und gehalten ist die gesamte menschheit freiwillig oder gezwungen zur religion des islam zu bekehren

3651660 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3651661 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3651662 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3651663 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3651664 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3651665 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3651666 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3651667 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3651668 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

3651670 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3651671 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3651672 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3651673 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3651674 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3651675 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3651708 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3651709 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3651710 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3651711 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3651712 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3651713 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3651714 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3651715 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3651716 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3651718 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3651719 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3651720 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3651721 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3651722 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3651723 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

3651734 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3651735 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3651736 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3651737 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3651738 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3651739 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3651740 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3651741 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3651742 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3651743 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3651744 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3651745 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

3651780 australia of course stands ready to contemplate humanitarian assistance there have been a large number of civilians who have been killed or injured or displaced
3651781 at officer level in new york through the un georgia approached a number of countries for military assistance
3651782 our response was of course the obvious which is we are not interested in a military solution here were interested in ceasefire and a dialogue so that was made very clear
3651783 the cost saving was substantive suggesting that verification of ejection fraction should be performed in all patients considered for a primary prevention icd
3651784 is that we are putting in a lot of unnecessary icds because the referred patients probably have better heart function than we think
3651785 if icds are the most useful in patients who have poor heart function icds may be even more useful than we think if we can do a better job of selecting who needs them
3651786 this doesnt prove that were necessarily doing a better job of picking candidates by doing that what this proves is that the initial assessment of heart function isnt necessarily accurate when we repeat it systematically
3651787 there are enough reasons to believe that over time with repetition the heart function assessment will change and should be verified before proceeding to an icd implant
3651788 one of the reasons we chose muga for the referral assessment is that its primarily a quantitative technique
3651789 its an objective way to measure this its reliable and reasonably reproducible so we used it as a gold standard

3651794 tobacco is a legal drug whose use is declining and precisely because it is legal its users are far more amenable to government control education programmes and taxation
3651795 the idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous
3651796 although it makes intuitive sense that the predictive value of a screening test in such a high risk population wanes over time our findings suggest that mortality and arrhythmic risk with a nonnegative mtwa test result remain robust through the first two to three years

3651803 this retrospective study included a group of patients with ischemic stroke who also had a history of active migraine at the time of pfo closure
3651804 in this sample of patients we found that those who had migrainous aura had an odds ratio of 3 5 that they would more likely experience migraine relief following pfo closure than those who did not have aura
3651805 the jury is still out basically as to the migraine profile most likely to benefit from pfo closure and whether pfo closure is efficacious in reducing migraine frequency
3651806 that was very surprising for us as well and i think that has not been previously reported at least in long term follow up
3651807 a possible explanation is that migraineurs have increased cortical hypersensitivity and a large right to left shunt permits a greater volume of vasoactive chemicals and microaggregates such as activated platelets to cross the pfo and trigger migraine it is speculation that a significant reduction of shunt and transmission of these chemicals and microaggregates may reduce the threshold of cortical hypersensitivity and therefore reduce migraine frequency
3651808 migraineurs with aura were 4 6 times more likely than migraineurs without aura to experience relief after pfo closure
3651809 this needs to be repeated prospectively and with an adequate sample size before any definitive conclusions can be made
3651810 most of the time a positive tcd is indicative of a pfo but this is not absolute
3651811 a positive tcd can also be due to a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation so there can be other sources of shunt although the most probable source is a pfo that is another limitation of this study we assumed the residual shunt was related to incomplete pfo closure but that was not confirmed in all cases
3651812 i definitely do not believe that all migraine or even all migraine with aura can be attributed to pfo we do know from epidemiology studies that migraineurs who have aura have a higher prevalence of large pfos than the general population but i dont believe we can say that this is the be all and end all treatment for all migraineurs there may be a subpopulation of migraineurs for whom there is some potential causal mechanism between pfo and migraine and who may benefit from pfo closure but the mechanism has yet to be determined as does the efficacy of pfo closure
3651813 if a little bit of chemical goes through you dont get a migraine but if a lot goes through you do get a migraine i think thats a reasonable theory
3651814 the population that seems to respond to pfo closure is those people with episodic migraine who came in with cryptogenic stroke or some neurologic symptoms their pfos were closed and their migraines got better
3651815 the problem is the fda wont let us treat these kinds of patients with a permanent device
3651816 because of the risk benefit ratio associated with permanent implants they want us to study only the most disabled patients which is reasonable the problem is we dont know if that will actually work or not particularly with the results of mist weighing on everybodys minds
3651817 so hopefully things will be a little bit liberalized and they will be able to increase enrollment
3651818 but we wanted to show that there was some intermediate step between this very early phenomenon that epidemiologists have found and the situation when you are 50 or 60 is there something already going on in early childhood that can show that this process is already in play
3651819 whats really interesting about this study is that we found good associations between size at birth and biology that might lead to hypertension but its very sex specific
3651820 if we are able to untangle this biology in humans at this sort of age in greater detail then we should then be able to target these processes much earlier in life than we currently do if you or i go to the doctor aged 30 or 40 were unlikely to impress upon them that we need to have anything done to modify our risk of heart disease but its possible that in the future that view will change
3651821 this adds weight to the general health advice about good maternal nutrition which we know is crucial in determining fetal size and we know that mothers not smoking is also very important
3651822 in boys we found that the lower their birth weight was within the normal range the more likely they were to have a higher vascular resistance and higher blood pressure particularly 25 to 30 minutes after the start of the stress test this probably represents a prolongation of the vascular stress response in these boys
3651823 in contrast girls who were smaller at birth did not demonstrate a specific response to stress they consistently whether under stress or at rest showed evidence of greater activity in the sympathetic nervous system which could have adverse effects later in life
3651824 we didnt test the baroreflex activity in the children but this is another mechanism by which people who are smaller at birth could go on to develop hypertension in later life
3651825 this is the first evidence in children of relationships between size at birth and the later function of the heart and blood vessels the sex differences in these relationships were striking and may eventually lead to a better understanding of why men and women tend to develop high blood pressure and heart or vascular disease at different times in their lives
3651826 i think thats quite exciting because it might make us look much more carefully at things like sex hormones that could drive this and make it a sex specific phenomenon
3651827 fetal growth and development are important in determining the way your physiology works throughout life if youre exposed to certain environmental triggers at the right time in your development then your physiology is changed and an important part of this is that it appears to be changed permanently or at least dramatically so that even if you could modify it you cant change it back to where it might have been

3651835 to our knowledge we are the first to examine the relationship between maternal plasma lipid concentrations and habitual fiber intake during pregnancy
3651836 these results suggest important health benefits of increased fiber consumption before and during early pregnancy
3651837 this prospective study provides additional evidence of reduced preeclampsia risk associated with higher maternal dietary fiber intake in early pregnancy
3651838 fiber intake was also inversely related with maternal triglycerides and positively related with hdl concentrations although to a lesser degree during early pregnancy
3651839 taken together with previously published literature and if confirmed by other studies our findings may motivate increased efforts aimed at exploring lifestyle approaches particularly dietary approaches to lower the risk of preeclampsia

3651904 b leaching causes the anemones to lose their symbionts after which they may shrink and eventually die due to the temporary loss of photosynthesis
3651905 the shrinkage weakening or disappearance of the host anemone can limit the clownfish population the size of the female fishes and the potential for new recruits
3651906 additionally loss of fishes can then affect the survival and growth rate of the anemone
3651907 this negative cycle of shrinkage as a result of bleaching and subsequent loss of clownfish protection followed by further shrinkage may have led to serious declines in the anemone habitat available for new fish recruits and this may have depressed the reproductive success of the remaining fishes
3651908 the assumption of commercial collectors that removing breeding adult clownfishes increases survivorship and growth of young recruits is contentious
3651909 removing breeding adults or even sub adults could cause the anemone to shrink thereby reducing the amount of space for new recruits and it may be up to 6 months before the fishes begin to breed again
3651910 before we put the fake flies in they were taking the occasional pot shot at overhanging leaves and other objects around their display but you could see their hearts werent really in it

3651913 a focal male t sarasinorum that was guarding a pair of mating t antoniae chased off the paired t antoniae male and began courting the t antoniae female
3651914 when the heterospecific pair went to the substratum to spawn the female t antoniae quivered suggesting the release of eggs or sperm in female and male fishes respectively but the t sarasinorum male did not
3651915 instead he remained still alongside the female until she finished quivering then immediately turned around and attempted to eat the eggs that the heterospecific female had just laid
3651916 the female left immediately after spawning but the t sarasinorum male did not follow as would generally happen when mating with females of his own species
3651917 incredible finding just backs up ideas about game theory and strategy in evolution all the more to me any more info on these fish and are these species ever found in the trade from a first sight theyd look great in my planted tanks

3651919 ik was in een grijs verleden systeembeheerder destijds was ik me erg bewust van de macht die ik zou kunnen hebben ik kon in alle systemen ik kon data ook priv van collegas inzien
3651920 hij sprak mij aan op die verantwoordelijkheid en gaf aan die te willen delen en deed dat ook
3651921 hij maakt aan mij als jonge systeembeheerder duidelijk dat hij heel goed wist wat ik zou kunnen doen samen legden wij het ook uit aan gebruikers en het management van de organisatie iedereen werd bewust van deze zaken en er werden heldere afspraken over gemaakt wat doe je met priv data wat kan wel en wat kan niet hoe ga je om met bedrijfskritische gegevens etcetera daar ligt nou precies de oplossing let op iemand die echt kwaad wil hou je niet tegen neem echter wel voorzorgsmaatregelen wees open en direct en maak heldere afspraken dan kom je een heel eind
3651922 een kwaadwillende garagemonteur kan ook je remleiding doorknippen wat dat betreft is de macht van een ict beheerder niet uitzonderlijk
3651923 als er een dreiging van controle is bijvoorbeeld door audit trails dan is het gevaar een stuk minder
3651924 ik kon toen als systeembeheerder iets flikken onder de naam van een ander de verleidingen zijn dan groot
3651925 goed beschouwd is het natuurlijk vreemd dat systeembeheerders zonder enige moeite inzage kunnen hebben in meer informatie dan de directie van een bedrijf de meestal jonge systeembeheerders worden vrij gemakkelijk achter systemen gezet waar ze enorm veel macht over krijgen vaak zonder dat ze goed worden voorbereid hoe ze om moeten gaan met die macht
3651926 er zou een goede screening moeten zijn van systeembeheerders let wel die screening moet regelmatig herhaald worden
3651927 wat ook gaat helpen is wanneer het fenomeen reputatiemanagement verder op gang komt als je de boel belazert sta je niet meer in linkedin maar in linkedout probeer dan eens aan werk te komen
3651928 er bestaan al systemen die de systeembeheerder niet complete inzage in alle data geven alle data kan standaard gecodeerd encrypted worden opgeslagen en kan ook zo over het netwerk worden gestuurd alleen degene die inzage in de data moet hebben zou hiervan de digitale sleutel moeten hebben
3651929 voor het werk dat systeembeheerders doen is het meestal helemaal niet nodig om alle informatie van iedereen te kunnen zien en mocht het nodig zijn dan zou dat alleen moeten kunnen met medewerking van personen die normaal gesproken ook bij de informatie kunnen of in een uitzonderlijk geval met medewerking van het hoger management
3651930 ik ben lang systeembeheerder geweest en heb altijd toegang tot alle gegevens gehad dat betekent niet dat je naar believen gaat snuffelen normaal is daarvoor ook geen tijd maar met een nieuwe generatie van point and click beheerders kunnen misschien meer problemen verwacht worden ook omdat ze het goede voorbeeld van hun directie krijgen die met miljoenen gaat schuiven en die daar ook niet bepaald eerlijk aan gekomen zijn
3651931 wanneer in een maatschappij de verdeling niet meer terecht is kweek je problemen dus ook deze dat is een maatschappelijk fenomeen dat niet specifiek voor de ict is vraag maar in liechtenstein waar een ict er gegevens van belastingontduiking van duitsers op grote schaal aan de duitse belastingdienst verkocht heeft een beter voorbeeld bestaat niet
3651932 in sommige kleine of middelgrote organisaties heeft een systeem of applicatiebeheerder een positie als goeroe nerd techneut god in frankrijk of noem de scheldwoorden liefkozingen en andere kwalificaties maar op in het artikel worden ze jochie of jongen genoemd geen wonder dat het een week duurt voor het gevraagde komt
3651933 neem een beheerder eens serieus hij kan die vaak eenzame post aan omdat hij een vak geleerd heeft je moet er niet aan denken dat hij weggaat niemand heeft grip op zijn werk of kan het controleren in het beste geval heeft hij een geheimhoudingsverklaring ondertekend dit geldt vaak weer niet voor tijdelijke ingehuurde beheerders
3651934 ict helpt de beheerder daarbij ook niet welke leverancier of producent van ict applicatie of apparatuur levert ook hulpmiddelen waarmee de beheerder bijvoorbeeld aangebrachte veranderingen in een systeem kan terugvinden laat staan dat een in of externe auditor het kan welk systeem beschermt de beheerder tegen zichzelf en voorkomt daarmee al dan niet opzettelijke fouten
3651935 een beheerder in een middelgrote organisatie moet alle rechten hebben om tekortkomingen in systemen of applicaties te kunnen corrigeren zodat de business verder kan beveiligingsnormen op het gebied van informatie of netwerkbeveiliging veranderen daar niets aan omdat zij uitgaan van de huidige complexiteit en de facto onbeheersbaarheid als de beheerder maar documenteert maar wie stelt vast dat het gebeurt waarom gebeurt dat niet automatisch
3651936 de complexiteit van ict neemt dusdanige vormen aan dat vrijwel niemand de gevolgen van veranderingen of misbruik meer overziet een beheerder kan en mag rechtstreeks in configuratiebestanden systeemregisters en stuurbestanden maar ook in de personeelsdossiers wijzigen voor de organisatie lijkt er niets aan de hand

3652203 juergen has turned things upside down but now the results have got to come otherwise the changes will mean nothing

3652206 caroline mostly takes on superior players that are stronger than she is and the top players are often faster than she is but she fights to win

3652226 los dos encuentros ante el anorthosis son muy importantes para nosotros no ser f cil porque nuestros oponentes tambi n intentar n darlo todo por participar en la fase de grupos estos partidos ser n a todo o nada si clasificamos todo estar bien si no lo hacemos ser muy negativo tenemos que cerrar nuestros fichajes y dedicarnos a la preparaci n de estos dos enfrentamientos
3652227 hubo dos cosas que nos costaron aquel partido la falta de experiencia europea y la sobreexcitaci n tras conseguir el tanto como visitantes en la ida nos pusimos por delante en la vuelta disputada en casa lo ten amos controlado cuando marcamos porque todos sentimos que est bamos cerca de lograr el pase para la fase de grupos pero despu s del empate del olympiacos nos derrumbamos

3652251 consumers today dont know how long things really need how long wine takes to mature how long an apple takes to grow slow freight is a pedagogic thing if the ships late its because its working with nature
3652252 this is a novel concept which captures energy continuously from the wave as it passes enabling it to capture far more energy per wave
3652253 being below the surface it has virtually no visual impact and as no water is sucked in or expelled from the system it poses very little risk to sea life
3652254 most dramatic change in our energy policy since the advent of nuclear power
3652255 without doubt the best thing to emerge from berr over the last five years
3652256 eu wide moratorium on investment in new coal fired power stations lasting at least until mid 2010
3652257 the government does not believe there is a need to ban new coal build in order to meet our emissions targets
3652258 we also have everything set in place for the uk to take a lead in that field the plants the engineering talent the storage sites and the political capital too theres a big win win there to be seized
3652259 these quirkier designs are looking to invoke values like durability individuality and a distinctively local feel
3652260 the interiors are cool and style savvy but with personality and individuality
3652261 the jury is still out on whether its something that can be put on or taken off as passing fashion dictates
3652262 its more cost effective to do a cut out store design but we keep the reclaimed materials in stock and recycle them between stores
3652263 our target customers are in their mid 30s plus so they really relate to the vintage slightly retro d cor of our unique stores
3652264 the vintage pieces also reflect our core values of quality and quirky and we are recycling pieces rather than paying a shop fit company to knock up some cheap modern piece so we are doing a tiny bit of green stuff too
3652265 it takes a strong understanding of what you stand for to do it with panache and stop it looking like a bloody jumble sale
3652266 i have now reached the point at which i no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear let it happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried how much this will cost and who will pay and there is a legal guarantee that no civil nuclear materials will used by the military we can no longer afford any rigid principle but one that the harm done to people living now and in the future most be minimised by the most effective means whatever they might be
3652267 a year ago the department of energy published a list of 151 planned new coal plants today 59 of those are off the list either theyve been refused licences by state governments or the utilities have quietly pulled out because of mounting local opposition and meanwhile another 48 are being challenged in the courts
3652268 citigroup and merrill lynch have urged their clients to get rid of coal stocks and major investment banks such as jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley have said they will not finance new coal fired stations unless the utilities can demonstrate that the plants will be economically viable after the government imposes restrictions on carbon emissions
3652269 now the problem with that from the utilitys point of view is that no one knows what the cost of carbon will be so theres no way you can demonstrate the plant will be viable
3652270 i always look at wall street see where the venture capitals going
3652271 it was budgeted at around 900 million for a 175mw plant not a large plant at all then in a matter of months it had spiralled to 1 6 billion and was poised to go higher and the department of energy just said look guys this is not economic i mean 1 6bn for a 175mw plant its off the chart and theyd chosen a site where the underground storage was right there its not as though they had to pipe carbon 300 miles to sequester it
3652272 i always look at wall street see what the venture capitals doing and i just dont see any going into this technology
3652273 weve just seen the first big win in the fight to stabilise the worlds climate
3652274 its just possible that by the end of 2008 well have something approaching a de facto moratorium on new coal plants in the us weve crossed a tipping point on this issue and its amazing how fast it has happened this could be the first big win in the effort to stabilise the earths climate
3652275 rick parry the republican governor of texas is backing a plan to develop 23 000mw of wind power in the state just to put that into perspective the entire capacity of wind worldwide has only just hit 100 000mw
3652276 that would put them way ahead of texas in per capita terms and would meet a sizeable slice of state electricity demand this is huge stuff
3652277 california led by republican governor arnie schwarzenegger jumped out with a major solar programme and now youve got maryland and new jersey planning to outdo it adjusting for population size of course and then theres charlie crist the republican who replaced jeb bush as governor of florida there were five major coal fired plants slated for florida theyre history now instead hes planning on building the largest solar thermal power plant in the world
3652278 all this is happening in a country where the federal government officials the ones who go to climate negotiations in bali and so forth havent got a clue whats going on i mean its as though there are two different countries washington has no involvement in this at all
3652279 the mayors have stepped up and started doing things over 500have signed up to the goals of the kyoto protocol and said were going to meet those regardless of what washington does
3652280 unlike the texan oil fields theres no way theyre going to deplete the wind so when you build the infrastructure the wind farms the transmission lines and so on youre basically there for the long haul sure youll have to replace parts from time to time but once its there it can last as long as the earth itself
3652281 for example in the us we use a huge amount of freight fuel to transport coal if you phase out coal you have a dramatic drop in diesel fuel use and an associated fall in carbon emissions its the same with water if you have wind farms in place of thermal power plants whether coal gas or nuclear water demand drops precipitously
3652282 reduce income taxes raise carbon taxes there are a lot of things we can do but if i were to pick one id say that this is indispensable if we dont restructure the tax system were probably not going to make it its that important
3652283 if we dont restructure the tax system were not going to make it its that important
3652284 were all economic decision makers as consumers as corporate planners as government policy makers or investment bankers we are all guided by the signals in the market by the price signals the problem is that we have been getting really really bad information from those signals and so weve been making really bad decisions which is why we are in so much trouble today if wed had an honest market a half century ago we wouldnt even have most of these problems
3652285 and once you explain that this wont mean any overall tax increase you know what eighty ninety percent of people will say sure why not
3652286 stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system

3652302 there has been a huge sea change in public attitudes on the environment in the last couple of years
3652303 using more transistors to speed up a single core processor doesnt bring any real return so the solution that all microprocessor manufacturers are moving toward is putting more cores more threads onto one chip and building a parallel computer onto a chip
3652304 so the amount of parallelism on a chip is increasing very rapidly
3652305 it tells us were getting more and more transistors on a chip and where before we equated that to more performance on a single thread now that translates to larger levels of parallelism on a chip
3652306 we would hope they dont stoop to the level of dealing in terrorism
3652307 but its all about making money and moving a product so thats where we have to concentrate our enforcement efforts

3652316 i dont think that should just be available to a few students
3652317 im not giving a student answers to an exam thats coming up
3652318 yes web sites like postyourtest com are worrisome partly because we can be pretty sure that not all instructors are changing their tests every semester as they should
3652319 it should be something of a wake up call we should assume that if weve given a test then the test is somewhere out there these sorts of sites bring that message home to faculty
3652320 the site seems more focused on enabling users to get to the test that they might have to face with a given instructor than it is on providing learning guidelines about the things that are important enough in the course to appear on a test

3652368 saakashvili was mad to go and bomb a town in the middle of the night
3652369 the georgians fell into a crude trap they thought that russian prime minister vladimir putin would not retaliate in the middle of the olympic games
3652370 when putin is there he talks more than medvedev but in front of the press its medvedev who does the talking
3652371 wir verzeichnen keinen einbruch bei unseren reisebuchungen auch wenn die hohen kerosinpreise in zukunft zu preisanstiegen von bis zu 50 euro f r eine pauschalreise f hren wird das von den verbrauchern hingenommen die murren zwar aber sie buchen trotzdem ausschlaggebend ist f r viele nicht unbedingt der preis sondern ein berzeugendes angebot

3652373 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3652374 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3652375 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3652376 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3652377 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3652378 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3652379 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3652380 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3652381 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3652382 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
3652383 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3652384 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3652385 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3652386 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3652387 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3652388 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3652389 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
3652390 what the administration is proposing to do is allow agencies to decide for themselves that their actions will not impact endangered species and thereby remove any opportunity for the experts at the fish and wildlife service to review those determinations
3652391 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
3652392 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3652393 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3652394 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3652395 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3652396 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
3652397 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3652398 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3652399 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people
3652400 we appreciate the vfws help in assisting soldiers it would certainly make it easier for soldiers but there are other ways to help them recoup their money for army travel
3652401 even in their present incomplete form hips are already having a positive impact on the market
3652402 consumers are benefiting from faster transactions reduced stress cheaper searches and better protection
3652403 with more consumer friendly information in packs from the beginning of next year along with the ending of estate agents marketing homes without packs the benefits will be increasingly obvious for all to see
3652404 the provision of a condition report and full environmental information would really drive consumer demand for hips
3652405 we recognise that there is much more work to do to build on this solid beginning fortunately although the hip product is not complete the regulatory framework is absolutely fit for purpose to drag this inefficient process into the 21st century
3652406 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3652407 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3652408 thats the signal people were waiting for things have fallen so low that we are about 50 percent cheaper than brazilian equity
3652409 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3652410 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3652411 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3652412 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3652413 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3652414 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3652415 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3652416 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3652417 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3652418 the current conflict faces a real risk of escalation and expansion most prominently in abkhazia where the likelihood of an operation to clear georgian forces from the kodori gorge appears increasingly likely
3652419 air strikes are likely to continue for the immediate term as russia seeks to further degrade georgias military capabilities moscow is now likely to seek the restoration of south ossetias de facto independence albeit on much more favourable terms to the separatists and russia itself
3652420 the european and u s criticism of russias response is likely to lead to a further downturn in russo western relations although any more serious diplomatic responses will likely be dependent upon russian actions over the next few days
3652421 overall georgia is facing reduced control over both abkhazia and south ossetia a short to medium term reduction in its military capabilities and greatly reduced hopes of one day joining nato with the organisation likely to view tbilisis actions in south ossetia as being far too unpredictable for a potential alliance member
3652422 the military action in georgia is a reminder to financial markets that geopolitical risks remain significant even if in recent times they have been overshadowed by economic and credit risks
3652423 the russian invasion of georgia is not the first sign that the putin dominated kremlin has been gaining in confidence as its oil revenues swelled nevertheless it probably does represent the crossing of a line that puts an end to the relatively pacific chapter of world history that began in 1991
3652424 this was unfortunately all provoked by georgia it light heartedly started its military operation in south ossetia and saakashvili did not take into account such a reaction
3652425 of course the sympathy is on the side of the weaker group for georgia especially as it is fighting a country that has caused a lot of suffering to all of its neighbours
3652426 but realistic analysis show the georgians made a big mistake now georgia will have to take the toll most probably disproportionally severe
3652427 saying that russia is coming back to its imperialistic phobias is absolutely wrong russia has understood years ago europe is already outside of its jurisdiction
3652428 if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
3652429 i just hope but i have no high expectations that the international community will be able to stop the russians at this stage i dont think anyone can say with certainty what their objectives are will they stop with south ossetia and abkhazia
3652430 its payback time by the russians for what the west did in kosovo the russians are in a very strong position what we have to try to do as western countries is impose some form of consequence on russia
3652431 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price
3652432 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
3652433 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
3652434 its a region thats not a viable state its delusional for the south ossetians to think they could be independent
3652435 if it hadnt been for the russian intervention then the separatists would have been rolled over very quickly they wouldnt have had a prayer
3652436 some south ossetians would have fled but most probably it would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
3652437 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
3652438 this is not and was never about south ossetia south ossetia is a place where russia found a pretext for military aggression against georgia
3652439 georgia was made an example of concerning the cost of standing up to russia and developing a country independently and thinking to join euro atlantic institutions
3652440 its basically the putin doctrine restoring russian control over the former soviet union irrespective of what those countries want which is why this is so reminiscent of the episodes in prague in 1968 and budapest in 1956
3652441 its a return to the spheres of influence and an attempt to undermine the entire building of the european zone of prosperity and security this is the biggest thing to happen in europe at least since the balkan wars and it might have much larger implications
3652442 the only way to reduce tensions is to have an extremely strong response
3652443 both georgia and russia have been much less cautious than the market had expected this has developed in quite an unexpected way its very hard to make any calls right now on how the war situation will develop or how it will impact emerging markets
3652444 obviously there has been a significant impact on russian assets
3652445 obviously people will also be looking at the baltics ukraine the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3652446 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas of any particular areas with a large russian population
3652447 i think saakashvili knew from the very beginning that russia would invade ossetia after georgian troops were sent there saakashvili did that on purpose and wanted to show the world what russia is like today
3652448 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3652449 this will distance georgias nato membership in the formal terms but in practice in the geopolitical sense this is strengthening georgias nato perspective
3652450 the kremlin must understand that it is making a dramatic mistake by using force in georgia for the first time since 1991 in a post soviet neighbourhood and the international community must consistently explain that to russia
3652451 i still believe the fighting will stop quite quickly because the long term interests remain the same for georgia this is not to resolve the situation by force and for russia basically not to resolve it at all
3652452 i think the tempers will cool and the parties will sit down at the negotiating table and basically return the situation where it was before this conflict
3652453 the disproportion of the forces is so big that the war does not have much sense and basically it is not in either sides interest to continue

3652455 we gt gt must dispel the myth that renewables are cheap because we have been gt gt silent on this people think it wont cost anything
3652456 ensure that there is a calculation and analysis of the need to provide flexible fossil fuelled back up capacity for the increased level of intermittent renewable e g marine and wind generation estimates suggest that this back up capability could amount to over 90 per cent of this intermittent capacity itself overall then that could require an increase in the uks installed generating capacity from todays 76gw to more than 120gw by 2020

3652466 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3652467 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3652468 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3652469 todays most pressing issues of social and economic development require more than traditional philanthropy
3652470 our agreement with microsoft today marks a joint long term commitment to help the most vulnerable in society with the most innovative appropriate solutions and technologies at our disposal
3652471 if we are to meet our goal of reaching the next 5 billion people around the world who are not yet realizing the benefits of technology it is critical that we look at innovative partners which span communities and geographies we are thrilled that the aga khan foundation u s a will work with the unlimited potential group to help address the needs of the marginalized urban and rural communities in africa south and central asia
3652472 nissan grows at lower cost gms assets more fully utilized

3652474 i am stunned at the reaction to my comments in the custom pc article i thought this was an old story
3652475 we havent been shipping chipsets for intel processors for a while now and are only shipping a limited volume of chipsets for amd chipsets
3652476 this comprises only a very small proportion of our total business our processor business makes up the vast majority of our revenues
3652477 via no longer sells some or all of these chipsets
3652478 to set the record straight while we are no longer making chipsets for cpus from other vendors we are continuing to develop new chipsets for the via c7 and via nano processors in addition despite what some reports have said we have not exited the motherboard business and will continue to produce motherboards featuring via chipsets and processors
3652479 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3652480 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3652481 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3652482 i think a drop of 20 is a bit over done
3652483 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3652484 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3652485 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3652486 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3652487 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3652488 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3652489 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3652490 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3652491 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3652492 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3652493 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3652494 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3652495 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3652496 we are committed to offer our consumers a unique and differentiated product

3652500 la soberan a es la supremac a de los poderes centrales y rusia desde luego reconoce la soberan a de georgia
3652501 pero este reconocimiento a adi no significa que el estado soberano puede actuar a su antojo
3652502 si rusia hubiera tenido otras posibilidad de reaccionar a la agresi n de georgia contra osetia del sur la hubi ramos utilizado pero no ten amos ninguna otra posibilidad de reaccionar
3652503 las normas de relaciones internacionales de acuerdo con las cuales operan las fuerzas de paz rusas fueron formuladas en 1992 y refrendadas en documentos internacionales posteriores dichas normas siguen en vigor

3652509 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3652510 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3652511 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3652512 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3652513 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3652514 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
3652515 im taking nothing away from them because theyve been unbelievable over the past two years
3652516 ive been used to being a 40 1 outsider for the sack but there always comes a time when a manager is put in this position it seems this is my turn
3652517 it is something i dont need but nothing surprises me in football anymore though
3652518 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3652519 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3652520 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3652521 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3652522 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3652523 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season

3652533 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3652534 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3652535 i thought it should have been a lot closer after the first round
3652536 i think the score was bad i think they were giving him a score for anything and i had to work to get all of my points
3652537 were not trying to put on a show were trying to play the game the way we know how to play
3652538 oh man i cant kick this thing this things a mess
3652539 its obviously not healed it had only been a month maybe and it kind of got split on the outside
3652540 i just love scoring no matter what no matter where it is
3652541 so scoring a goal in the olympics against a team like sweden is just a huge feat for me
3652542 shes such a great target player she has a nose for the goal
3652543 and with her there it allows kara lang to play wide right and were three pretty big players up top its nice to have her back
3652544 the ankle felt great and it was great to be out there and contribute in a hard game against sweden
3652545 most of the u s teams have these masks and its not just the u s teams on some of the bad days there were a number of people wearing them
3652546 we were just silly enough to do it walking in
3652547 i couldnt tell you how happy i am with our offence
3652548 it could be anyone on any given day and thats the good part were not relying on one person
3652549 that helps a lot especially when youre trying to work through some stuff
3652550 it allows you to just completely relax and focus on what you need to do without the pressure when one run might mean a ball game
3652551 we are young we have just as many who havent been here as players who have olympic experience and dont really know what its about
3652552 during our whole training period we tried to get to as many multi sports events as we possibly could between pan ams and world university games to get those young gals as much experience as we could to being in this atmosphere
3652553 its never going to be like the olympics but understand that theres 38 or 40 other sports going on and all different kinds of people and all different kinds of countries competing you cant replicate the olympics but at least they got the opportunity to see what it was like
3652554 im so excited to play the states we hate each other
3652555 thats pretty much it its a great rivalry its going to be a great game and its the olympics so it just raises the bar that much more
3652556 dont write that thats a lie we love each other
3652557 no its a big rivalry obviously we play each other so often we know everything about each other so its going to be a little catty but its always a great game in the end
3652558 you become rivals especially with how much we play them
3652559 since ive been on the team we havent beaten or tied the states so its always a match i look forward to because this is it every time and this is it its time
3652560 its going to be another key game between two teams that know each other very well and a team that is used to winning the u s a
3652561 they always bring the best out of my players so we look forward to it
3652562 theyre obviously one of the best teams in the world but i dont think theyre playing as well right now as they have in the past
3652563 so we think weve got them at a pretty good time three days from now so obviously it would be ideal to knock them out in the olympics and not allow them a chance to win a medal
3652564 cuando vuelva de los juegos arreglaremos lo que haya que arreglar
3652565 ahora estoy en los juegos ol mpicos donde tengo que dar mucho por brasil vamos a esperar a ver qu ocurre con el betis donde ya me dijeron que me quer an unos treinta equipos

3652594 its not a ton of money but im saving some money
3652595 its pretty inexpensive to live in hungary i didnt ask for a car because my towns pretty small and i save a lot of money on gas
3652596 we havent played a game since june not a top class game
3652597 our goal was to qualify for the olympics it doesnt mean we came here just to float around in the pool
3652598 we didnt expect to medal but we planned on making teams work for it and so far we havent really done that
3652599 punches kicks ball grabs all kinds of stuff anything can happen elbows
3652600 you get held under water sometimes but you get used to it its not so much the drowning youre worried about its when your heads underwater youre pretty vulnerable to a knee or a punch thats usually what you worry about
3652601 ive been bitten as well ive been bitten on my neck and on my arm ive got teeth marks on my biceps it was a cuban guy last summer i punched him the face but i did it under the water
3652602 it seems to be a question of whether this downbeat sentiment leaks into other sectors that will help determine precisely how markets perform in the coming hours and maybe days but we also have an increase in fundamental news too
3652603 when we were first paired we were still talking about changing partners and stuff like that but the more we talked the more solid we got as a pair
3652604 shes my first friend my confidant and shes the person i most want to share this with
3652605 its going to be a battle but any of the eight guys could be on the podium
3652606 it was all great right from the get go i felt great in the water and powerful coming home said brown who won his semifinal in 2 08 84 one second ahead of the canadian record he had established in qualifying
3652607 i wasnt expecting 2 08 this morning but im pretty pleased with myself and it sets me up well for tomorrow he said
3652608 the only tough event was the 100 metre freestyle and it basically just came down to i didnt go fast enough hayden said
3652609 this relay was still a very good relay i know you always want to have medals hanging around your necks they have to award the effort but we just took two seconds off our national record and if you look back that time would have put us on top of the podium in athens
3652610 you cant start at the bottom and just magically appear on top were just going to keep climbing were almost there but its a tough climb
3652611 with our strong position in the buoyant middle east and the continued opportunities for growth in our core uk sectors we are confident that interserve is well placed to maintain its progress
3652612 and he said to me hows your injured leg doing
3652613 its the olympic games and were officially olympians and thats why were proud
3652614 thats why our individual diving wasnt good i was a little over the vertical and when youre not straight it makes a splash the technique was really good it was just the entry oh well i can do nothing about it now
3652615 our synchro throughout the whole competition was probably the best thing weve ever done
3652616 but were still proud of what we did it was fun
3652617 just dont take the olympics too seriously there are other competitions afterwards
3652618 boom boom bindras fired up a nations imagination and given indian sport a desperately needed shot in the arm
3652619 we havent even begun to scratch out what those elements of the ceremony might be
3652620 i believe the show will have great integrity we have to work our way through that and make sure we have a show that satisfies the requirements in the stadium inspires canadians and is a wonderful television show around the world
3652621 i started thinking about surpassing those greats and thats when i started tearing up
3652622 to be at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling

3652644 its not unrealistic to think im capable of doing another one
3652645 weve already kind of determined that theres no reason that in four years ill be any less fit or strong as i am now
3652646 i think the hardest thing for me is i love my sport
3652647 its a lifestyle sport that id be doing anyway to be paid to do it and to have fun doing it is special and i dont want to give it up if i dont have to itll be hard to walk away because its so a part of what i do
3652648 im hopeful ill find something that pulls me and gives me as much excitement as this does and lets me sink my teeth into it the same way this does
3652649 to have a body of work like that is sort of beyond what i hoped
3652650 i thought because it was such a limited field at the olympics thats where i was going to make my mark not being world champion world cup champion all those things
3652651 i kind of by accident did all the things i thought wasnt possible in trying to do this one thing i never did its kind of an interesting road
3652652 above my bed ive got a huge flag of the olympic rings i had made up a huge huge flag of the olympic rings
3652653 i see that every morning when i wake up and thats all i need for motivation
3652654 i expected things to happen for some reason i got mad and kicked myself in the butt and realized that things arent going to be given to you its not just going to happen
3652655 i think if there was a high level of competition in canada i wouldnt have gone like that because i would have continually been pushed to be on my best just to make national teams
3652656 but i had a big cushion youre talking two body body lengths that didnt help
3652657 before this i was on a mission i wanted to go and i want to break my record i was too focussed i was too into it and you need to be obviously but theres a fine line you have to enjoy it every single second
3652658 this isnt the biggest venue but they really love the game here and appreciate it said anna rice the top canadian who became the first north american woman to reach the singles round of 16 before being eliminated

3652660 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaida we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3652661 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3652662 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents

3652668 the reductions in harmful emissions secured by this settlement are substantial and will have a beneficial impact on air quality in arizona and downwind areas
3652669 srps willingness to settle rather than litigate the various issues in this case allowed the parties to focus their efforts on securing the best results for the environment
3652670 we determined that the best path with epa was to reach a settlement that would be reasonable and fair for both parties

3652682 many of the muscles that control the hand start at the elbow or forearm they run down the forearm and cross the wrist and hand some control only the bending or straightening of the wrist others influence motion of the fingers or thumb many of these muscles help position and hold the wrist and hand while the thumb and fingers grip or perform fine motor actions most of the small muscles that work the thumb and pinky finger start on the carpal bones these muscles connect in ways that allow the hand to grip and hold two muscles allow the thumb to move across the palm of the hand an important function called thumb opposition the smallest muscles that originate in the wrist and hand are called the intrinsic muscles the intrinsic muscles guide the fine motions of the fingers by getting the fingers positioned and holding them steady during hand activities

3652688 what was essential and therefore justified in the pre state days is now assuming an ugly and violent form of colonial occupation the authoritarian regime in the territories the creation of two legal systems the placing of the army and police at the service of the settlement movement the robbing of palestinian lands
3652689 if society does not find the emotional strength to remove the noose of the settlements nothing but a sad memory will remain of the jewish state as it still exists
3652690 mired in delays a shortage of resources and differences between israelis and the americans over what military capabilities those forces should have once deployed in the territories
3652691 perhaps most worrying of all is that as palestinians lose hope in the peace process and look despairingly at both the fatah and hamas leaderships there is a danger of extremist al qaeda style alternatives emerging such activity may already be taking place today as politics breaks down into clan structures and groups like the army of islam appear hamas is not al qaeda but the alternative to it might be

3652710 never doubt that a few thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
3652711 we have been invited by the palestinian red crescent society of gaza to go to gaza the people of gaza expect us and will come out in their boats to meet us we will fish together
3652712 we are going through international waters we are not going through israel israel claims gaza is unoccupied and so we are going to unoccupied territory we will embark in cypress and disembark in gaza this can play out in many ways we may get blown out of the water we may get towed away but we will remain nonviolent and exercise the sovereignty of international waters for we are not going through israel we will not allow the coast guard to enter onto our boats we will demonstrate nonviolently our solidarity with the residents of gaza who invited us we are taking food water medicine but the issue is solidarity with the people of gaza if our rights are denied we will remain nonviolent
3652713 israel is not a democracy but is an ethnocracy meaning a country run and controlled by a national group with some democratic elements but set up with jews in control and structured to keep them in control missing from israels security framing is the very fact of occupation which israel both denies exists and that security requires israel control over the entire country rendering impossible a just peace based on human rights international law reconciliation
3652714 there is nothing new in gaza just more acute and the internal breakdown due to restrictions and 527 physical barriers and cantonizations make it impossible for palestinian businessmen to move their goods and they have been forced to hire israelis as middle men who are able to transport palestinian goods over the 535 miles of roads that palestinians have been denied access to
3652715 this has caused fragmentation isolation cantonization which will soon become worse
3652716 there is a great sense that the people are robbed of their space and time and this has resulted in a de development of the human being the issue is no longer occupation but sovereign control all vestiges of palestinian presence is being destroyed by israel
3652717 dont worry we know you are coming and we are waiting
3652718 it is time to speak openly and honestly about israel
3652719 forty years ago to this day june 8 1967 the change occurred the floodgates opened and money poured into israel as never before

3652724 io se non mi attacco alle persone dopo le faccio soffrire giulia io speravo volevo attaccarmi a te ma non ci sono riuscito e non voglio farti stare male
3652725 non voglio che tu ci stia male o almeno spero non tanto io ho capito come sei giulia tu ti attacchi alle persone subito e sbagli perch cos soffri di pi non devi cambiare questo no perch senn tutti penserebbero che sei falsa devi evitarlo poi devi trovare la persona alla quale tu piaci tanto e che piaccia tanto anche a te perch questo quello che meriti e se continuassimo a stare insieme io ti farei solo stare male ti prego guardami
3652726 e guai a te se appena arrivi a casa ti metti a piangere
3652727 io voglio che rimaniamo amici se tu mi chiedi di andarci a prendere un gelato io vengo volentieri e potremmo anche parlare perch no
3652728 si b ma solo che ogni tanto ci penso c quasi 5 giorni che non stiamo pi insieme e penso che sia normale ma adesso io ci parlerei anche tranquillamente non avrei nessun problema poi se dovessimo ritrovarci e ripensare a noi due io gli direi di no anche se vorrei dirgli un milione di volte si ma andrebbe a finire come stavolta e ormai ci sono abituata sono stufa di fare i tira e molla in cui alla fine a me non me ne frega pi niente e gli altri dicono di essersi presi e quando ero io quella presa avevo sempre corna o venivo trattata da cani insomma donny la mia vita sentimentale un casino ecco perch mi attacco subito alle persone io ho paura a stare sola e per una volta che avevo trovato uno che non era stronzo lho perso per sempre

3652733 we would hope they dont stoop to the level of dealing in terrorism
3652734 but its all about making money and moving a product so thats where we have to concentrate our enforcement efforts
3652735 we ask ourselves is this person truly who they are
3652736 they can fly as low as 500ft through the valleys straight down into the united states undetected
3652737 sometimes on a flight that only lasts 10 minutes and vehicles are waiting there ready to pick it up
3652738 quite often its just going to be a little smudge
3652739 lets say theyre running out of water so theyre dragging their toe or theyre jamming their heel or digging that toe when theyre pushing off or something scared them or maybe they seen me coming and theyre running

3652741 satellites can track radio frequency radar that can track aircraft theyre all cutting sign in one manner

3652743 ik hoop dat de bbfc hier in alle ernst naar zal kijken en tot de conclusie komt dat de game niet geschikt bevonden is voor een classificatie

3652749 we want to see the various heritage sites in punjab to be linked together in groups so that the visitors can be led from one site to other to enable them to see all the heritage sites at once rather restricting them to only one or two of the sites
3652750 the golden temple is not the only sikh heritage site in punjab there are lots of other places which are overlooked lots of pilgrims go to anandpur sahib which is wonderful but just down the road is kiratpur which is very important from the point of view of sikh heritage its a lovely little town having lots of lovely gurudwaras heritage gardens and so on these places are missed since they are not publicized well enough we want to emphasise those
3652751 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3652752 second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3652753 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers
3652754 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells
3652755 in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
3652756 finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3652757 the rights and liberties of law abiding citizens are being undermined with more state officials trying to enter and spy on peoples homes

3652765 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3652766 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3652767 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3652768 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
3652769 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction

3652773 stormen komen veel vaker voor tijdens de winter en daardoor verrast een zomerstorm vaak meer mensen ook wegens het grote aantal activiteiten in open lucht daardoor is de kans op schade en overlast groter dan bij een winterstorm van dezelfde kracht bovendien staan de bomen in blad en zijn daardoor gevoeliger voor forse windstoten

3652775 rabbi we all know youre a teacher straight from god no one could do all the god pointing god revealing acts you do if god werent in on it
3652776 youre absolutely right take it from me unless a person is born from above its not possible to see what im pointing to to gods kingdom
3652777 be born who has already been born and grown up you cant re enter your mothers womb and be born again slide 3 baptism you must be born again what are you saying with this born from above talk
3652778 youre not listening let me say it again unless a person submits to this original creation the wind hovering over the water creation the invisible moving the visible a baptism into a new life its not possible to enter gods kingdom
3652779 change your life turn to god and be baptized each of you in the name of jesus christ so your sins are forgiven receive the gift of the holy spirit
3652780 if youre confident that im in this with you and believe in the master truly come home with me and be my guests
3652781 sell me your secret show me how you did that how much do you want name your price
3652782 to hell with your money and you along with it why thats unthinkable trying to buy gods gift 21 you ll never be part of what god is doing by striking bargains and offering bribes slide 29 you must repent 22 change your ways and now ask the master to forgive you for trying to use god to make money 23 i can see this is an old habit with you you reek with money lust
3652783 pray for me pray to the master that nothing like that will ever happen to me
3652784 all attempts to get rid of this have sprung from doctrinal prejudices
3652785 we are to understand christ as he expected his auditor to understand him john the baptist baptized both jew and gentile as a sign of purification by repentance from past sins nicodemus would then have certainly understood by the expression born of water a reference to this rite of baptism
3652786 ikzelf ben er dus klaar voor maar het wordt heel moeilijk om de finale te halen ik heb gezien dat er 62 meisjes zijn ingeschreven en slechts 15 mogen er daarvan naar de finale er zijn veel meisjes die de 5000m beu zijn en die het nu op de steeple proberen
3652787 ik loop natuurlijk liever s avonds maar op het wk vorig jaar in osaka was het ook al zo
3652788 dat betekent dat ik om 5u00 of 5u15 moet opstaan maar we zijn nu al een tijdje ook zo bezig dus zon probleem is het niet
3652789 als ik de finale wil halen zal ik sowieso risico moeten nemen
3652790 dat wil zeggen dat ik zelf het tempo in handen zal moeten nemen als het te traag gaat de verandering van de regels is wel niet in mijn voordeel vroeger gingen naast de 3 automatisch geplaatsten ook nog de 6 tijdsnelsten door maar nu gaan de eerste 4 van elke reeks en de 3 tijdsnelsten naar de finale
3652791 mijn plan was eigenlijk om bij die tijdsnelsten te zijn want met een tijd rond de 8 22 of 8 24 zat je daar normaal gezien bij nu wordt het tactisch moeilijker
3652792 que no deber an haber sido toleradas y que ustedes tienen ineludible obligaci n de comprobar actuando en consecuencia en definitiva el gobierno de canarias persegu a a toda costa que fuese considerado de
3652793 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy key players
3652794 a magnificent indication to all that nobody is above the law
3652795 i can see great potential for a new ball attack of harmison and anderson if they can both sustain the levels they showed in this oval test they are a contrasting partnership just as harmison and matthew hoggard used to be
3652796 thats absolutely right england need him to come back and strike up that same partnership with anderson in all forms of the game he may complain about the travel and the absence from his family but i can tell him you are a long time retired
3652797 harmison is a professional sportsman he doesnt want to get to the end of his career then look back and wish he had played more for england
3652798 it is a great honour to play for your country and it should be all the more enjoyable when your captain is right behind you telling you that youre the man england need to turn their fortunes around
3652799 i thought the balance of this side selected for the oval test looked much better the challenge for england now is to maintain the intensity and commitment that they showed at the oval thats what makes the australians so good if you look at their attack now their bowlers are not special in terms of natural ability you might even say that england have them covered but the aussies mental attitude their consistency is so exceptional they may not be better bowlers but they are more disciplined more focused and that is where they score over england who have too many bad days
3652800 it is up to the players to maintain the highest of standards they have to take individual responsibility they cant expect the captain to get them pumped up for a match all the time the number of bowlers pressing for selection should help
3652801 above all harmisons success in the last week has proven the value of regular first class cricket we saw the same with ian bell the only innings of substance he played in the series came after he had just got a double hundred for warwickshire
3652802 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week whilst holidaying in america
3652803 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3652804 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him still wearing sunglasses during the ceremony
3652805 they looked very happy together i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3652806 they didnt bring any friends as witnesses so the photographer had to stand in
3652807 i asked them each if they agreed to love and cherish each other and they said i do it was over in 15 minutes the bride changed out of her wedding dress right away then they left the groom wasnt dressed up at all
3652808 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3652809 this is another step taken by ndtv lumiere to ensure that the best of world cinema is accessible by audiences after the introduction of the theatrical release of films across mumbai delhi bangalore and kolkata this association with jaman is another step in our journey to present these wonderful films to audiences not just in india but also across the saarc region

3652811 this mouse model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3652812 this is a crucial breakthrough for scientists fighting lewy body disease further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets
3652813 it is because of the astonishing generosity of telegraph readers that this research came to fruition we cannot thank the newspaper and its readers enough for their extraordinary munificence
3652814 before the birth of the child both the mother and father who gave the ovum and sperm should have been dna tested and a dna fingerprint of the child should have been made which in this case does not seem to have been done
3652815 the case needs to be probed because if it becomes a practice then nobody would come forward to adopt a child in india and rich people from abroad will continue coming to the country and indulge in surrogacy it is misuse of law

3652846 stay at home mom has taken on a new meaning economic stresses particularly sky high gas prices have kept many of these mothers and their families closer to home base than theyd like a development some find isolating and deeply frustrating
3652847 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3652848 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3652849 we just dont have as much money as we used to kagan explains weekends the family now goes to parks more than museums and instead of going to the movies they rent

3652856 we are not staying home with our children by default
3652857 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal she says
3652858 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3652859 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that she says
3652860 but i dont think it would pan out in the end

3652863 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3652864 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year says the mother of three from marysville calif
3652865 it was too expensive to work what with the hours drive each way and the cost of daycare for two kids she now has three now it would make even less sense
3652866 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon she says
3652867 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible she says the family also needs a bigger car to fit everyone but that would take too much gas

3652869 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves allman notes that means no date nights either but shes hopeful that may change

3653022 whatever parliament decides will be the voice of the people
3653023 has no understanding of politics because he has not been involved in politics
3653024 considers himself a master tactician but that is in matters of war
3653025 the statistics from this study confirm what has widely been known not only is a degree critical to getting a job but it is also key to advancing in ones career
3653026 and given the current economic climate a degree might be needed just to keep your job
3653027 the message is loud and clear that in todays competitive job market if you dont have the right education others will pass you by
3653028 we found that 22 of people who started college but didnt finish have been denied a job raise or a promotion what is shocking is that workers are telling us that not having a degree is becoming a significant roadblock in their careers
3653029 were sending our bomb disposal teams to make sure all the villages are safe from booby traps and landmines that were left behind by the retreating rebels
3653030 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
3653031 the red cross has finally been able to get in were preparing to feed 85 000 people for the next five days
3653032 they can bring their complaint to the ceasefire committee because taking him to court might have an adverse impact on the peace process
3653033 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3653034 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3653035 for decision makers in the nato countries of the west it would be worth considering whether in future you want the men and women of your armed services to be answerable to mr saakashvilis declarations of war in the caucasus
3653036 har m o todo lo que apruebe el parlament de catalunya
3653037 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this
3653038 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3653039 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3653040 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3653041 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3653042 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3653043 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3653044 tehrik e taliban and al qaeda theyre all under attack we suspect this blast has been done by tehrik e taliban to take revenge for our activities
3653045 we are hitting their hideouts so naturally they are responding
3653046 there is no way to confirm it because the site is not accessible it is in control of the taliban
3653047 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3653048 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3653049 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3653050 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3653051 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3653052 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3653053 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3653054 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3653055 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3653056 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3653057 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3653058 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3653059 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3653060 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3653061 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3653062 the man was trying to kill himself and told police he would kill them if they came inside
3653063 were negotiating with him and were trying to establish a line of communication
3653064 he was alone and we were able to successfully negotiate with him to surrender
3653065 this recipe is from marcia adams cooking from quilt country and is very similar to my grandmothers pie
3653066 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3653067 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3653068 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3653069 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out
3653070 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3653071 the target would never know what hit them further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike
3653072 things will be finalised today it will be a government of national consensus
3653073 efforts for a consensus government were still on in spite of the dispute between the maoists and the nepali congress over the defense portfolio
3653074 the passage to the formation of the next government should not be obstructed even if the nepali congress continues with its claim to the defense ministry
3653075 um das kundenwachstum zu stimulieren haben wir die preise substantiell gesenkt

3653077 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3653078 estamos hablando de una norma para impedir que hereden aquellos que cometen actos de violencia contra una mujer un menor o cualquier otra persona
3653079 existen muchas disfunciones en los c digos civiles y penales que hay que ir corrigiendo para adaptarlos al principio de igualdad
3653080 estamos hablando de toda la violencia que se produce en el mbito de la familia en la direcci n que sea
3653081 esta norma que se va a llevar a cabo durante la legislatura tiene adem s una caracter stica importante no hablamos s lo de violencia f sica o psicol gica sino tambi n de la violencia econ mica en este sentido aquellos progenitores que incumplan la manutenci n de sus hijos van a perder tambi n los derechos hereditarios
3653082 es la primera campa a institucional que se hace con un mensaje espec fico dirigido a aislar socialmente a los agresores es muy importante que quien comete este tipo de delitos tenga el rechazo de hombres y mujeres
3653083 son incapaces de suceder por causa de indignidad el que fuere condenado en juicio por haber atentado contra la vida del testador de su c nyuge descendientes y ascendientes
3653084 ex c nyuges o personas con quienes el agresor estuviere o hubiese estado ligado de forma estable por an loga relaci n de afectividad
3653085 contra la vida delitos de lesiones graves de torturas o contra la integridad moral o contra la libertad y la indemnidad sexual y delitos contra los derechos y deberes familiares
3653086 we assess that intent to attack the u s homeland remains undiminished
3653087 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan
3653088 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3653089 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3653090 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behaviour
3653091 nepali congress will not join the government as an opposition party it will play an active role in constitution making
3653092 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement
3653093 tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3653094 musharraf has continued to cling to the office of the president defying the clear verdict of the nation in the february 18 elections the people had voted against his dictatorship and steps taken on november 3 2007
3653095 since the supreme court was prevented by the illegal removal from office of judges who refused to take oath under pco from ruling on the validity of general musharrafs election in october 2007 we support the governments decision to impeach him under article 47 of the constitution and call upon the government to bring these proceedings to a speedy conclusion
3653096 we call upon the government to take these steps simultaneously with the commencement of the impeachment proceedings rather than after their conclusion
3653097 it was a routine meeting we normally meet with the captain and coach before naming the national team
3653098 obviously there can be different views over team matters lawson left the meeting early because he had to catch a flight
3653099 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3653100 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3653101 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3653102 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3653103 or we might be seeing the start of it right now
3653104 but no matter what the start date empirical data clearly show that extinction rates have dramatically increased over the last few decades
3653105 the centre must give the land to the amarnath shrine board otherwise our protest will continue
3653106 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice

3653114 es geht hier um eine routinem ige anpassung die ausdruck der allgemeinen lohnentwicklung ist
3653115 die beitragsbemessungsgrenze von der lohnentwicklung abzukoppeln w re nicht sinnvoll weil dies den spielraum f r eine senkung des arbeitslosenversicherungsbeitrags verringern w rde

3653121 for some more time inflation can increase it could touch 13 per cent but by december it will start declining and is likely to moderate to 8 9 per cent by march 2009
3653122 it inflation could be brought down to 8 9 per cent by march 2009 through co ordinated policy action
3653123 the tight monetary stance needs to be maintained till the pace of inflation comes down
3653124 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect indian economy as well
3653125 one of the early ones i thought oh theyre here to see me i struck a james bond silhouette behind the curtain and then i heard everyone talking through the intro music
3653126 i burst on to the stage about to start singing poison arrow and it was horrible one bloke clapping
3653127 we look at it as a different dimension the laws of physics are different here
3653128 its more of a parable about the way we are rather than the way were going to be thats why it starts out as a fairytale a long time ago in a galaxy far away once upon a time
3653129 it deals with princesses its purposely designed not to be about where were going its about where weve been and what we can learn from the past in the present
3653130 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week
3653131 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts no further comment from either will be forthcoming

3653137 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3653138 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3653139 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3653140 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3653141 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3653142 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3653143 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3653144 it is great to see the air wing getting its wings back the force will be able to respond rapidly to accidents and other emergencies
3653145 we are going to destroy all those old things we have many of them
3653146 after the gruesome murders he went into hiding and later reported to world vision in apac district claiming he was a rebel
3653147 here we were depending on ecomog and people were being killed behind the line we were going to run into the sea what were the values of our lives see responsible people from liberia washing peoples clothes our mothers the food problem was grave people dried goat skins soak them in water cut them into pieces and ate them as substitute for meat
3653148 so we the muslims undertook the risk to ask taylor question on the bbc so we hastily organize the concerned group called movement for the redemption of liberian muslims mrm and i went on the air and asked taylor why you are killing our people
3653149 we told them that though we had no money we had the almighty god
3653150 i and others in guinea went to president lasannah conte and told him that the situation was escalating and that taylor was proving tough because of the massive support he was getting from allies such as burkina faso and libya
3653151 you better be happy that they did not kill you do you look like soldier
3653152 but i say something to you eventually we would have just sneaked out of guinea and come to liberia
3653153 all of the offenses of the ruf which already existed had been stopped and that the government of momo had been convinced that they liberians had met business
3653154 we are an anti rebel movement we are not rebels
3653155 some people wrongly think port is the preserve of men but we have created a drink which will appeal to women because it is light and flavoursome
3653156 obviously it will take some more money 3 1 billion is the price of the fully loaded christmas tree
3653157 were supposed to have 100 percent of kids take algebra in eighth grade and be proficient
3653158 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support
3653159 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
3653160 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
3653161 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california

3653183 these samples are taken to jws cydna laboratory a sanas accredited facility where 41 determinants are tested and analysed

3653190 there is a relationship of respect between this government and teachers but we did not hear the commitment to eliminate that funding gap and thats what we were waiting for
3653191 we will not sign a long term agreement that does not eliminate that gap
3653192 kids should not be held up for ransom by anyone and if we dont see a resolution to this situation programs are going to start being affected parents are going to get angry and then there goes the public confidence in education that weve worked to rebuild in the last few years

3653195 trading in the 08 summer season is strong in all markets and early indicators show that we are currently ahead of last year for winter 08 09 and summer 09 while we are encouraged by these early results we are increasing our flexibility to give us the levers to pull in tougher market conditions including fuel price hedging and capacity management in all our markets
3653196 we are encouraged by the progress made across the group in our first quarter of trading
3653197 you get a bra and you get a bra and you get a bra

3653201 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3653202 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3653203 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3653204 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3653205 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3653206 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it

3653211 one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness
3653212 the mildest of comments critical of the political agenda of homosexual activists
3653213 there is no branch of government with the authority to redefine marriage
3653214 the state of scientific research on the causes of homosexuality
3653215 no natural method by which two males or two females can create offspring in which both partners contribute genetically
3653216 a father and a mother collaborate in rearing children that share a genetic contribution from both parents
3653217 the nearly universal male biological desire for diversity in mating
3653218 why should married people feel the slightest loyalty to a government or society that are conspiring to encourage reproductive and or marital dysfunction in their children
3653219 orson scott card homophobic terrorist against the orderly pursuit of happiness
3653220 homosexuality is as valid a choice as heterosexuality for their future lives
3653221 the alpha males should control everybodys sexuality especially the womens
3653222 which means the date on which democracy ended in america was actually 12th june 1967 when the judges on the us supreme court made a new law without any democratic process
3653223 in any case i dont actually care why homophobic bigots are bigoted
3653224 held themselves out as and have acquired a uniform and general reputation as husband and wife
3653225 in any case i dont actually care why homophobic bigots are bigoted i only want them to be powerless and voiceless grumbling and protesting that the beliefs they hold normal are being violated
3653226 incitement is fine that is free speech actually attempting to overthrow the government is not
3653227 actually i disagree i think incitement is not fine particularly if it inciting violence
3653228 to fill a world with religions of the abrahamic kind is like littering the streets with loaded guns
3653229 the freedom of religion means that no one has the right to attack malign or grossly offend a faith tradition they personally do not have membership or ascribe allegiance
3653230 in a way im glad it would have been extremely vexing to love his writing only to discover that he is a blinkered nut job who is tortured by other peoples well otherness

3653236 i felt suicidal to begin with it was like a bereavement
3653237 its like having your womanhood stripped away from you i was already 36 and my biological clock was ticking with every year my chance of getting pregnant was diminishing all your friends have already got children youre there waiting hoping somebody will come forward and donate
3653238 not a day goes by without me thinking of that woman who i have never even met its the best gift that any woman can give another they are not giving you a baby but they are giving you the chance to make your own baby she have me the greatest gift of all hope
3653239 it has been stressful and challenging but as you can see we have two wonderful children ivf was our only hope to have children
3653240 unfortunately due to a shortage of donors the average wait for a donor egg across the west midlands region is approximately two and a half years with the length of wait increasing year on year
3653241 like many areas in birmingham and the wider west midlands theres lack of awareness that there is a donor shortage many women simply dont realise that donors are needed or that they themselves could become a donor the give hope give life appeal aims to address this problem and hopefully boost the number of donors

3653245 we are also cognisant of the areas of concern outlined in the report such as regulatory uncertainty
3653246 the department is pleased that the report recognises the significant role that government has played and will continue to play in eskoms ability to achieve its investment plans
3653247 governments recent commitment to accelerate the disbursement of the r60bn loan from five to three years will increase eskoms ability to attract investment for the build programme
3653248 the build programme can be expected to continue and the utility will carry on looking at ways to increase capacity
3653249 still retains an investment grade rating and also enjoys strong government support

3653276 ten out of ten stars an amazing feat im thrilled to have had the pleasure to see this online gaming economy work before others and consider it a privilege
3653277 this is going to be boom time for the next few months which will be helpful during what otherwise would be down time for us
3653278 i doubt that acklin sernas documentary on the online gaming economy trends of today measures up to our work boon rasmussen and the bemrose barch studios and production center has produced an authoritave online gaming economy work which i believe will take a strong place in the history books
3653279 i had to really look closely at the tendancies of human nature and the interactions of online gaming economy within our world it took me weeks of study and research to grasp the depth and breadth of knowledge around this online gaming economy subject
3653280 since were taking a look at how online gaming economy tendancies affect every day people i think this will broaden our reach and span across various audiences everyone whether or not they are at all involved in the online gaming economy industry will want to see this film
3653281 wow the fact that everyone is talking about this film by wiszynski kaupu is exciting and impressive weve set aside a private showing license for next week just for our own employees and their families and will probably have to schedule additional showings in the near future

3653294 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3653295 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3653296 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3653297 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3653298 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3653299 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3653300 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3653301 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3653302 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3653303 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3653304 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3653305 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3653306 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3653307 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3653345 you need to keep in mind weve played the top two teams in the world in our opening games and we only have to finish in the top four
3653346 i think a bit of pressure will come off now and we can get into a groove
3653347 in a very short time this festival has become an integral part of summer in the finger lakes
3653348 this line up of world class performers is one of the important reasons that canandaigua is gaining a reputation as a center for the performaning and visual arts we look forward to the innovative music being presented at this years canandaigua lakemusic festival
3653349 each of our concert programs is like a tasting menu ranging from familiar masterworks to the delightfully unexpected
3653350 were known for showcasing works that are brilliant but rarely performed such as bernsteins piano trio and a newly commissioned quartet by dan visconti one of the leading composers of the next generation
3653351 we are very lucky to be holding this series in one of the best performance spaces in the area
3653352 not only is this air conditioned hall acoustically excellent but our audiences always comment about the warm ambiance and the powerful sense of intimacy they feel as they listen to world class artists close up
3653353 bristling with exhilarating musical ideas and a powerfully created lyricism
3653354 noam sivan will lead a lively musical show for the whole family that invites the audience to unlock their inner composer experiencing music from the inside out

3653364 this first year was a critical year now the patient is out of the icu but hes not ready to go home yet
3653365 what science has told us is that everything that we do can affect negatively or positively lake clarity since we are primarily a tourism community this is a huge economic issue for us
3653366 we were very worried it was a great relief to hear that the lake had not sustained the damage we had feared

3653422 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3653423 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3653424 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3653425 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3653426 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3653427 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3653428 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3653429 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house

3653445 esiste il rischio che leuropa e gli usa si dividano sullatteggiamento da assumere nei confronti di mosca c chi come la polonia e i paesi baltici seguiranno gli stati uniti nella sua probabile politica del muso duro mentre altri paesi come per esempio la francia potrebbero decidere di procedere lungo unaltra strada adottare una tattica pi morbida vedo il pericolo di nuove divisioni nuove incomprensioni nei rapporti transatlantici

3653451 a civil relationship with other countries in the region can only be good for turkey but the threat of iran obtaining nuclear weapons is serious and turkeys leaders simply may well be in over their heads
3653452 turkey is blundering its way in this complicated relationship unsure which side it wants to take or how big a threat it sees iran to be turkeys political leadership believe they can dance with iran and simultaneously become a major regional player
3653453 this visit represents a diplomatic triumph for tehran since assuming office three years ago ahmadinejad has feverishly pursued diplomatic ties with western allied states in an effort to weaken the wests will to take action to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons turkey is the first nato member to welcome him to its territory
3653454 while both the us and israel have voiced their displeasure with turkeys embrace of their enemies neither country has taken any steps to either discredit ankara or to distance themselves from the turkish government to the contrary both countries continue to praise turkey as a strategic ally and both are enabling and indeed encouraging turkey to act as an intermediary between them and their sworn enemies

3653458 the price was arrived at not by ourselves but in discussions with the manufacturers
3653459 the georgian government is trying to extend the conflict into other regions and turkey is the country that benefit most from the pipeline
3653460 turkish red crescent teams entered tbilisi under harsh conditions with convoys surreptitiously scurrying through deserted cross streets
3653461 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3653462 from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3653463 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3653464 turkey doesnt want this war but it has had a difficult job adjusting its foreign policy towards russia and georgia
3653465 there are broader strategic considerations in this conflict turkey needs to be cautious
3653466 it is very important that the decision is put into practice both sides should act meticulously to avoid further bloodshed
3653467 western countries apply a soft model for immunities which include only criminal action and verbal offence however in a strong model for immunities even motoring fines are included when the new constitution is to be studied political immunities in turkey need to be discussed to ensure transition to a softer model

3653469 cruise companies and yachts have trouble finding well trained staff thus i took action to fill the need in the area trainees of cruiseacademy get a chance to find overseas employment on cruise ships with high salaries
3653470 we started our courses in cooperation with the bo azi i university in istanbul and milta marina in bodrum the greatest demand for courses comes from anatolia region while we had 120 trainees last year this years trainee number is already 80 our course fee is ytl 540 we especially accept high school graduates and multilingual people to our courses
3653471 trainees of the courses also have a great chance to work abroad greek ships employ many people while dalmatia also calls for staff a well trained crew member has no chance of ending up unemployed forty five trainees who attended courses last year have easily found employment
3653472 one can make over ytl 2000 even at the beginning i know some turks working on ships who get salaries of around 3500
3653473 marine administration classes will be the first of their kind in turkey we will not only expand the course program to meet labor scarcity but also plan to form an association
3653474 they said i was crazy and claimed that turks do not board ships for a vacation
3653475 almost 300 people took a holiday on cruise ships in 2000 today the number has approached 20 000
3653476 the measures also earned the appreciation of the underage girls who do not wish to marry
3653477 every driver had his own style of moustache and our company brass decided that everyone should shave off their moustache as a solution
3653478 many of the drivers thought of quitting their job but most of them accepted the change
3653479 we have to work we shaved since we needed to but we really felt offended
3653480 the technical problem here is that fact that the boat overturned and its propeller hit something before hitting the water the cause will be known after the technical investigation
3653481 the lifeboat was tested for weight and workers crowded onto it the boat turned on its head and some workers fell into the water the rope tying to boat to the ship snapped falling on to the workers workers crushed each other and drowned when the boat started taking on water
3653482 our friends are dying and authorities are just silent i had worked together with one of the dead workers that day
3653483 our efforts to end work related deaths have been constantly ignored
3653484 the government instead of taking measures is blaming the limter union and the workers themselves
3653485 i expect di li to confirm that he received the 1 million everything is clear
3653486 di li demanded 1 million to follow up the issue and this demand was documented in a protocol di li promoted the value of lands and then sold them at a higher price
3653487 the protocol was presented to the public as a document of bribe but that is an ill intentioned aspersion
3653488 as soon as our paper hit the presses i put the stories on all major wires
3653489 and response from beyond was instantaneous phone calls from various high volume news agencies rained in seeking further coverage and dibbs on the rest of the gaming in indonesia story
3653490 i have worked numerous leads for gaming in indonesia stories for years now
3653491 and cultured a vast quantity of insiders to feed me information with all these sources our paper will finally have the chance to write the best review possible complete with valid information and up to the minute reporting
3653492 after my stint with the daily news i moved over to investigative reporting
3653493 and i found my home i love investigative journalism particularly in the gaming in indonesia industry where there is always a juicy story to be told furthermore it is of great benefit to our community to report such news
3653494 and i want to be very careful about releasing the most reliable and pertinent information related to this gaming in indonesia issue possible
3653495 but after about five years of experience i can say that it has become much easier and more exciting
3653496 its best to have a solid foundation in english and writing
3653497 and with time and experience youll become a pro at gaming in indonesia reporting in no time
3653498 im happy to finally find out the truth about what goes on when it comes to gaming in indonesia affairs
3653499 ive always been weary of the gaming in indonesia industry and its operations but finally we now have the truth
3653500 and i intend to harness its power to better inform everyone about various gaming in indonesia happenings in our area
3653501 gaming in indonesia news is hard to come by especially in this locality where confidentiality and industry intelligence are well kept secrets
3653502 we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions

3653521 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3653522 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3653523 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3653524 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3653525 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3653526 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3653527 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3653528 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3653529 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3653558 strong demand and very limited supply of grade a office space has led to unprecedented low vacancy levels in central

3653560 last period the ministry of culture and tourism announced a master plan for tourism growth we expect 50 million tourists and an income of 50 billion in 2023
3653561 it is crucial to diversify tourism to reach these figures
3653562 our current tourism consists of sea sun and sand however conference health and winter tourism as well as faith sports and ecotourism should become widespread in turkey to create diversification we should develop tourism in every place and expand it to every month of the year because tourism is in the top spot in terms of contribution to turkeys economy
3653563 turgut zal opened a path on which others are now trying to walk
3653564 end of an era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism
3653565 from the start the edwards scandal has belonged entirely to the alternative and new media
3653566 bloggers and online commentators who refused to let the story sputter into oblivion
3653567 never made a serious effort to investigate the story even as the enquirer wrote one sensational report after another
3653568 i think the times like the washington post usa today the wall street journal the los angeles times major networks and wire services was far too squeamish about tackling the story
3653569 the times did not want to regurgitate the enquirers reporting without verifying it which is responsible but the times did not try to verify it beyond a few perfunctory efforts which i think was wrong
3653570 there was a tendency fair or not to dismiss what you read in the national enquirer
3653571 certain reluctance by members of the mainstream media to admit they were beaten on a very big story by the enquirer so they didnt chase it
3653572 were republican former presidential candidate mitt romney instead of john edwards this would be on the front page of the new york times
3653573 at a time of reduced resources for news covering its difficult to commit a large expenditure of money to a story that appears in the national enquirer and may or may not be true
3653574 if edwards had been the likely nominee it would have been looked into more aggressively by the mainstream media
3653575 but he was seen as a person who is somewhat on the margins so it reduced the need of editors to spend a lot of money to look into it i dont think that political bias played a part a republican might have had the same treatment
3653576 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3653577 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future

3653580 loggerheads had existed in s l kl in the past i was born in s l kl and know the area well i have never seen loggerheads there so far i might have seen only one or two
3653581 officials from the environment ministry came and erected the signboard there and then they left
3653582 these tourists have to leave s l kl after they spend at most two hours for sightseeing simply because there are no hotels in the area for them to stay in if there existed hotels then they would stay in them this is the reason why we want tourism facilities to be constructed there
3653583 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3653584 during the first half of this year 2 882 complaints were filed for 60 910 tenders
3653585 we are planning to increase the application fee for complaints and bring a time restriction with a law proposal at parliament
3653586 information we receive suggests that the right to complain is subject to some bargains people who complain as a profession threaten tender winners with canceling the bid and demand money
3653587 the land in question has an extra construction site of 100 000 square meters the construction plan approved by the culture and tourism ministry permits the construction of a hotel apart hotel casino marina yacht club shopping centers restaurants congress centers fuel oil sale units sports and amusement centers and health clubs on the land
3653588 all the facilities on the land will be transferred to the owner of the land free of charge in 2038 no changes or additions can be made on the land without the approval of the owner for the concerned time period in addition the rents and profit shares will be paid to the owners until 2038

3653614 ala at is the most popular boutique hotel town in turkey the first boutique hotel was opened there in 2001 today the number of boutique hotels in ala at is 59
3653615 very nice hotels have been opened but such a growth should have taken place in a controlled way all hotel managers came together and signed the petition in which we ask our mayor to stop further construction of boutique hotels in ala at
3653616 only 20 percent of hotels were full in 2007 as number of rooms increase and number of visitors remain stable hotel managers decrease the room prices which in the medium and long terms might cause a decline in the quality of tourist visiting ala at
3653617 cultivated and well mannered visitors from upper classes mainly the ones who suffer from plaza tiredness
3653618 i do respect everyones idea but it is legally not possible to prevent any investor from opening hotels in the area we also cannot discriminate in giving licenses to investors who legally have a right to build hotels but still i believe we should deeply analyze this problem
3653619 we believe they will consider us in the new program but there may be warning actions to express ourselves better
3653620 some proposed to throw keys which would be a very severe action however some others proposed to halt exports for one day of course exports will take place during the day however the registers will be delayed to the following day we would like to draw attention with a working day in which no export takes place
3653621 our competitive power is being erased with this exchange rate and turkey is becoming an import haven the rate is not at a realistic level at present if the situation continues there will be no producer and exporter firms left in turkey within two years
3653622 the problem is for not only textile and apparel but for all sectors
3653623 in zmir we will negotiate the process thats been going on since 2002 we will look at the course of the conditions such as the exchange rate policy the current account deficit interest rates costs and energy prices

3653626 the tro as initially granted restricted the students from providing true publicly known legally acquired information about the mbtas charliecards and charlietickets in violation of the first amendment
3653627 the current tro as the mbta suggests that it be modified still restricts the students from providing true legally acquired information about these cards this restriction also violates the first amendment
3653628 we decline to discuss our ongoing communications with counsel for the mbta our priority at this point is to ensure that the temporary restraining order is lifted

3653631 dit is een overwinning op onszelf de teleurstelling na de nederlaag tegen hongarije was groot en bij dit duel stond er voor de meiden veel op het spel dat hebben ze goed opgepakt ik ben blij met de volgende ronde maar de doelstelling is hier bij de top vier komen
3653632 na de nederlaag tegen hongarije zijn we bij elkaar gaan zitten en hebben we gezegd de schouders eronder gelukkig liep het tegen griekenland een stuk beter
3653633 laten we zeggen dat ik een offday had ik hoop echter dat het nog beter kan dan tegen griekenland dit is echter een mooi succesje
3653634 het gevoel was wel goed maar als je tegen je max rijdt dan doet dat veel pijn
3653635 het was noodzakelijk om een hoge trapfrequentie aan te houden daarvoor moet je continu schakelen misschien ben ik nog iets te jong om die zware versnelling ook in de afdaling door te trappen
3653636 the gold medal for atos is not to be visible at all
3653637 if we pop up then something happened that was not planned
3653638 its not a question of marketing and publicity we are not a consumer company
3653639 were integrating so many suppliers we have no control over
3653640 you cant use the contract and incentives to motivate people in the same way
3653641 it is heartbreaking every time you dont play and one year sitting on the bench would not be good for my development
3653642 i have been trying to leave for a while because last season the week after i signed a new contract i was told i wasnt playing
3653643 sven goran eriksson was telling me he wanted me to play and let me develop and every day he was asking me about my contract situation
3653644 but as soon as i signed the contract when i got to the hotel before playing newcastle away in september i was told i wasnt playing
3653645 at the time i was playing and i had a good offer of a good contract but it might have been a mistake to sign for the four years
3653646 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
3653647 im in front of the stage and you literally see people break out into sobs or kiss each other and jump around expressing joy
3653648 when he exercises his right to have it the way he imagined it its a problem for both him and me
3653649 i just cant do it i cant remember it i have my own ideas im incorrigible
3653650 but not really to the extent where we were able to clear up all of our misconceptions about each other
3653651 it was really good for us to figure out what made the band work and what didnt work so we could appreciate each other unconfused by these other issues
3653652 we are the mighty police and we are totally at sea
3653653 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here
3653654 it was the commitment in the beginning that made it possible that it was a finite commitment that has actually made it a lot of fun
3653655 im fully prepared to say that was it were fine and were done
3653656 on the other hand im fully prepared if someone comes back in a couple of years and says we ought to give it a go you have to consider it
3653657 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that
3653658 sultank y and yeni iftlik towns have burgeoned considerably in that yeni iftlik has a higher potential for tourism compared to that of marmara ere lisi the center has a population of 10 000 and this level reaches 25 000 to 30 000 during the summer

3653684 they are investing in football and you should not take any team too lightly at that level
3653685 we have to advance to the champions league in order to contribute to turkish footballs progress
3653686 we await partizan and then our opponents after that we want to be in the champions league so badly
3653687 i wanted to leave when i was a reserve because when youre young if you dont play your talents can dissipate
3653688 i would love to play for a side in those leagues because they mostly play with two strikers up front and that maximizes the opportunities to score in a match i like to play like this

3653729 the circular by the governors office suspends foam parties until further notice we want the quality in tourism to increase and thus have accident free seasons
3653730 foam parties have been organized all over the world for the last 20 years and around 400 firms have been organizing such events in turkey for the last couple of years
3653731 one of these firms had an accident it is not right to ban all of them just because of one
3653732 this is just like a traffic accident you cannot ban driving cars because some drivers have accidents
3653733 the ban costs me money but i am still in favor of it
3653734 the accident that occurred last week is the first in the 20 year history of foam parties
3653735 the firms will have to obey the rules employ qualified workers and use qualified materials the liquid we use for foam is proven harmless to human health but it is expensive
3653736 so the hoteliers say you want 10 but another firm does it for two there should be standards this is not something that can be performed by an average man on the street

3653742 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results
3653743 it is because of them that i am able to get this far

3653804 the results from the follow up survey are encouraging as they demonstrate that hispanic americans are taking a more proactive role in their personal healthcare and becoming more informed about the prevalence of gerd in their community
3653805 but with more than six million hispanic americans suffering from a condition that can severely impact their daily lifestyles it becomes increasingly imperative for us to understand the signs and symptoms of gerd and talk with our doctors to help diagnose and treat the disease

3653813 lots of things have been happening weve been writing the score for the beijing olympics theres lots of colour and movement and jackie chan is going to sing our new single at the closing ceremony nah nah weve been having lots of children so weve been pumping them out left right and centre that takes a little bit of time unfortunately or fortunately
3653814 the theory is we could make millions out of this if we follow the cockroaches plan of world domination our fan base is rapidly dwindling so at least if we had our kids come to the gig in future wed have at least ten payers
3653815 straight out of their pocket in to ours heres ten bucks matey and you have to spend five of that at a random gig of our choosing
3653816 weve focused a lot of our song writing on fart jokes and shit so its not much of a change for us
3653817 weve employed people just to count the money and were in the tens of dollars now its been all good weve had exposure in the states and the song was used for a nissan car and we were on fox sports also were mates with rupert murdoch and if he wants to pay for some shitty adelaide soft cock pop rock well take it
3653818 thats what were telling everyone anyway the working title for the album is shiny turd
3653819 weve never given a shit about anything weve done before so why start now the good thing is that if you set the bar really low and you regard everything you put out as shit if anyone listens to it it is a bonus we pride ourselves on writing shit for the masses
3653820 thats the problem with society because everyone is looking at these magazines thinking that they can be beautiful they can be rich and they can be successful people should be modelling themselves on lazaros dog more with the reality that they are ugly un talented and unlikely to make money or be successful in their lives
3653821 like all of our songs it was something written in six seconds
3653822 the film clip was the funniest part as we employed twenty seven live rabbits for the film clip out shortly we were a little apprehension about how that might work out but it turned out pretty amazing as you could imagine twenty seven live rabbits in the studio while you film this clip was funny as things happened
3653823 rabbits have sex put it this way they actually had a lot at times we thought we were barry white as they were just going for it and im sure there will be some rabbits talking in the future to their husband or wife when theyll hear makin love on the radio and theyll say hey baby theyre playing our song it was hilarious because there is a scene in there where we had rabbits on this flying carpet going through the air humping humping was the focus we wanted humping and thats what we got
3653824 it makes the experience more enjoyable and they are so much fun humping rabbits is hilarious and there is no way around it
3653825 we do play an annual christmas show and thats all weve been doing for yonks its going to be good even though we are sufficiently rusty and thats always good because people expect that from us we promote ourselves as being one of the worlds worst bands so coming back and people see us loose they might think were back in form the bands we are playing with are great with tyger tyger and soft white machine joining us so get there early and check them out

3653858 we usually consider it fair that a financial business which has caused material distress or inconvenience or other non financial loss should be required to pay reasonable compensation for that
3653859 usually the question of awarding compensation only arises after a business or its appointed agent has breached a duty or been responsible for maladministration in its dealings with the consumer
3653860 maladministration might include delays clerical or procedural errors rudeness incorrect or inadequate explanations or simply a failure to respond to the consumers reasonable requests
3653861 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again
3653862 it helps being positive nervous because youve been waiting four years for this
3653863 i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster
3653864 i raced as well as i could i cannot affect what others do
3653865 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3653866 its the ride of my life its what ive dreamed about since i was a little kid
3653867 i had to stay focused on the descent and really push
3653868 this was much more about brown than scotland another kicking and one that will hurt the pm much more than losing london crewe and nantwich and coming fifth behind the bnp in henley it was a crushing below the belt blow in his own political backyard and may prove the tipping point for his own party
3653869 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3653870 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3653871 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3653872 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court
3653873 in the tent or not in the tent for health reform
3653874 it will be the biggest indicator of whether our preference for working in the partnership with the states has been successful or not
3653875 those agreements will have accountability measures and they have never been in place previously
3653876 they are just as enthusiastic as us they of course want more resources to go with it
3653877 the new health care agreement is the first step in our long term program for health reform
3653878 there are a range of other areas which could be fertile ground for this sort of approach
3653879 we could reward states which successfully implement innovative programs to reduce tobacco use
3653880 other areas where this sort of approach could be applied include obesity aiming to reduce the proportion of australian children at unhealthy body weight by a certain per cent within a certain timeframe
3653881 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3653882 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3653883 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3653884 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3653885 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3653886 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3653887 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3653888 perhaps its the occassion of playing at the olympics you dont get a chance to play here often so i told myself i must do better
3653889 i dont want my tournament to end in the next match i want to do the best that i possibly can
3653890 it is because of them that i am able to get this far
3653891 we all played very well the fielders hit especially well and scored a lot of runs so i could pitch wholeheartedly
3653892 wenn auch mit etwas geringeren wachstumsraten als in der j ngsten vergangenheit
3653893 ich will dabei sein wenn bayern w chst im moment geht darum die tendenz zu einer vertragsverl ngerung ber 2010 hinaus
3653894 das umsatzminus im warenhausgesch ft ist eine ziemlich gro e entt uschung zumal die wirtschaftswoche am montag berichtet hatte dass die kaufhausgruppe karstadt ein umsatzplus von 1 5 prozent berichten werde
3653895 bei karstadt fehlt die fantasie f r ein turnaround vor allem vor dem hintergrund der konsumneigung und der konjunkturellen entwicklung
3653896 die zahlen im warenhausgesch ft lagen deutlich unter den erwartungen der turnaround bleibt weiter aus und nun kommt hinzu dass das konjunkturelle umfeld zunehmend schwieriger wird
3653897 there is not much waterfowl shown on the isle of wight in fact i am the only one who shows on the island and i also show all over the country
3653898 so i wanted to do something along these lines but give something back to the poultry club of great britain so money raised will go to there as it is a charity
3653899 it has taken a year to organise but it is all going really well although it is a bit nerve racking
3653900 mum and dad have occasionally travelled abroad for holidays but have always returned to the isle of wight because they love it and have never been disappointed with the time spent there
3653901 mr and mrs howard have an obvious love of the place as demonstrated by their regular holidays since 1953
3653902 at a time when british holidays are said to be making a comeback for mr and mrs howard it seems the attraction of beautiful beaches and the traditional british holiday never went away
3653903 myself and two other vets worked out of a tin shack with a 40 watt lightbulb using donated drugs and instruments
3653904 it was challenging work especially in the conditions we faced the pressure we were under and the equipment we had available
3653905 seeing the living conditions in mdumbi makes you realise just how much we take for granted in the uk medicines included
3653906 we managed to win the confidence of a community that didnt even know that doctors for animals existed
3653907 what we did was a drop in the ocean but it made a huge difference to the community
3653908 before we left south africa we trained staff and other volunteers to continue with animal health programmes and provided them with the drugs and equipment needed to do so
3653909 it was a real disappointment had we got the numbers there it would have been a dramatic opening the knock on effect of it is we have had to do a rewrite unless the shot we have fits into the storyline it is likely to be dropped
3653910 the judges have been very impressed this year we have had the most entries for a number of years
3653911 o comprano i biglietti da noi oppure restano a terra
3653912 che si servono del web per scaricare informazioni e vendere tickets senza lautorizzazione
3653913 se arrivano a tanto vuol dire che sono in overbooking
3653914 the fire itself is not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3653915 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3653916 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3653917 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
3653918 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number
3653919 for individuals who have chronic issues this is a very serious problem
3653920 i feel healthy but two years ago i broke my ankle playing soccer and since that day i had to see a doctor and to buy health insurance
3653921 for latino people who watch a lot of tv everything that tv says is true
3653922 i dont feel comfortable because the exam is not in my language
3653923 more than one actor said to me this is actually fairly realistic kathleen i think they were fairly taken aback
3653924 when you have a problem scene you cant solve it by hopping around on one foot
3653925 i wanted to pepper that kind of imagery through it in ways that were not heavy handed but were just available for the person who recognizes it to enjoy another layer of meaning
3653926 its a little bit an ode to my mom just writing a little bit about the mother daughter relationship and the kind of really very elegant things she taught me about life attitude
3653927 youre writing from somewhere you should be writing from or i just need therapy
3653928 here i am directing a play i love so much thinking is it going to sell
3653929 were starting to be more solid there and with la mancha we dont know if its the show or were starting to burst out here its kind of almost overwhelming the response were getting right now
3653930 i think its incredibly enriching to share the same passion about something
3653931 kerry and i try to keep it low key enough so were not going insane
3653932 their motivation is for the group for the play for the love of what we do
3653933 and it maybe sounds a little corny but its the truth and hopefully my saying it isnt going to jinx it
3653934 we are more thoroughly an enlightened people with respect to our political interests than perhaps any other under heaven every man among us reads and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information
3653935 is it possible to create a wikibook under creative commons license

3653942 vodacoms plans for launching the iphone 3g to the market is still on track and we are not aware of any delays due to confidentially agreements we are not at liberty to disclose launch dates
3653943 it is an extremely ambitious plan but its challenged because its very dependent on many governments which equals many politicians
3653944 imagine how much thats going to multiply in complexity with 13 countries trying to agree on whats going to happen
3653945 yes we are discontinuing this product as we look for other opportunities to service the consumer
3653946 under the new law the media couldnt have identified him and he might still be at large
3653947 all nationalities together in georgia the armenians the azeris the georgians and the ossetians we will be together we will win together we will win
3653948 we will never surrender and we will tell this to the enemy thousands and thousands of times
3653949 we are a nation of warriors and we will fight until the end we will destroy the russians and retake gori well drive them out of south ossetia and well take back abkhazia as well onwards
3653950 i and a lot of my friends used to be against him
3653951 but hes our president we elected him and if we dont like him well remove him ourselves without russia this war has made georgia united
3653952 the situation is very difficult in the country i think that there is no time for internal political disputes
3653953 under such conditions it is an unwritten law internal political confrontations and disputes should be stopped
3653954 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3653955 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3653956 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3653957 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3653958 the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week while holidaying in america peaches first met max 23 a harvard graduate in anthropology two years ago
3653959 because my short stories are shorter i can spend more time looking at the micro elements of the story and spend more time touching up the details
3653960 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3653961 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3653970 guess its the still very narrow sandbox that apple provides to the coders
3653971 both unlocked iphone and blackberry is available on our site
3653972 i think you are correct to point out that most of the applications are neglected soon
3653973 when all these problem solved will app bring the iphone price to new high
3653974 yeah i definitely agree to you guys however extraordinary quality and luxury user
3653975 what that commercial didnt show was the night she went home with the iphone

3653998 if you are a contract researcher you are never part of the team people dont remember your name you are just here to fill a function
3653999 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3654000 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3654001 we really worked and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cannot win gold with two mistakes
3654002 im really excited this is the strongest team weve ever had and weve won the most important medal on home soil
3654003 the gold medal could attract more children to gymnastics in china and we will be even stronger in the future
3654004 i was still very calm i knew i was going to have to do more to compensate for what i did wrong
3654005 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them

3654008 todays agreement maintains the navys ability to test and train while shielding whales and other vulnerable species from harmful underwater noise
3654009 we found that within a couple weeks after the fire there was no significant impact
3654010 while some smoke and ash did come into the lake it didnt seem to affect the lake all that much
3654011 were worried about intense rainstorms either in the fall or spring where you have very hard rain falling on bare earth
3654012 this first year was a critical year now the patient is out of the icu but hes not ready to go home yet
3654013 what science has told us is that everything that we do can affect negatively or positively lake clarity since we are primarily a tourism community this is a huge economic issue for us
3654014 we were very worried it was a great relief to hear that the lake had not sustained the damage we had feared
3654015 obviously it will take some more money 3 1 billion is the price of the fully loaded christmas tree
3654016 were supposed to have 100 percent of kids take algebra in eighth grade and be proficient
3654017 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support
3654018 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
3654019 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
3654020 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3654021 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far

3654035 never to get lost is not to live not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction and somewhere in the terra incognita in between lies a life of discovery
3654036 give give give what is the point of having experience knowledge or talent if i dont give it away of having stories if i dont tell them to others of having wealth if i dont share it i dont intend to be cremated with any of it it is in giving that i connect with others with the world and with the divine
3654037 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
3654038 the night before the first auditions i didnt sleep a wink ive always been a big fan of the show so i was so excited to be taking part
3654039 but it was also really weird and scary to think i was going to be a judge i didnt know what to expect
3654040 the fact that i was a contestant myself in theory should help
3654041 my advice to the contestants would be that no matter how youre feeling try to focus and hold your nerves i used to feel so scared and i would allow those feelings to take over my performance and id feel disappointed in myself afterwards
3654042 i feel a bit uncomfortable about being called a judge id like to think im there to give my opinion and advice its strange to be working with louis walsh after he judged me on popstars
3654043 who would have thought six years on id be sitting next to him doing the same he was the first to come to my dressing room on the first day he helped to make me feel comfortable and welcome
3654044 the most memorable auditions for me have been a couple of solo girls weve seen that were amazing to the point where you go home and continue to think about them
3654045 as usual this years the x factor is completely unpredictable there are some of the strangest auditions i have ever heard and also one or two great people
3654046 although i am going to really miss sharon this year im delighted cheryl has joined the show and if the audition filming has been anything to go by we are in for a lot of laughs
3654047 it really is a big part of my life now even if it can be like living in a soap opera sometimes we had some really strong acts come through one group in particular really stood out manchester delivered good talent as it does most years
3654048 cheryl and i are desperate to hear some new cool songs on the show she is totally into urban music so hopefully we can get a flavour of that on the show
3654049 there was one young girl who had lost her dad in between her first audition and the judges callback it was her familys wish she should still go through with the competition
3654050 in a situation like that it is impossible not to get caught up with someones emotions and it became more than a tv story
3654051 wir haben im zweiten quartal 2008 unser bisher bestes quartal erzielt die globale d ngemittelnachfrage hat sich weiter sp rbar erh ht und f hrte vor dem hintergrund von verf gbarkeitsengp ssen im markt zu deutlich h heren stickstoff phosphat und kalid ngemittelpreisen
3654052 insbesondere f r kalid ngemittel ist daher zu erwarten dass die weltweite nachfrage mit durchschnittlich etwa vier prozent pro jahr weiter sp rbar wachsen wird
3654053 its not adequate to inspect a facility like this every three years

3654065 anybody who has bought a property at one of these sites is being kept up to date but this is an issue between us and the buyer the reason is the downturn in the housing market

3654081 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3654082 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3654083 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children

3654085 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3654086 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

3654092 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3654093 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3654094 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3654096 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3654097 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3654098 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3654099 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3654100 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3654101 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3654102 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3654103 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3654104 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3654105 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3654106 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3654107 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3654108 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3654109 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3654110 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3654111 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3654112 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3654113 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3654114 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today

3654135 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3654136 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3654137 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3654138 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3654139 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3654140 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3654141 every open opportunity they had they executed we set up shots great we had the rallies going we competed with them but we couldnt convert
3654142 they rarely lose in china so it will be interesting to see how far they can get in the olympics

3654189 just seeing how wine is a natural part of life not forced not pompous just very simple that was very appealing to me
3654190 i would like to see wine integrated into everybodys life it just makes the quality of life better i want people to see it as natural i think its the best complement to sociability which is something i love to do
3654191 its fun you get to taste a lot of wines thats why im here to satisfy my curiosity
3654192 people dont think twice about spending 80 on a kosta browne russian river or a sea smoke santa rita they buy an ungodly amount of pinot noir but not burgundy
3654193 wine has definitely caught on in a serious way with my generation hopefully it will continue to become more of an everyday occasion and lose a bit of the pretense
3654194 i couldnt get this education anywhere else if i cant find an answer to a question in a book i will ask darrell corti he will know
3654195 a lot of young people are making the switch from quantity to quality they are drinking more variety its not just cabernet and chardonnay they are drinking things they havent heard of before or hadnt tried

3654199 there are a lot more young people drinking wine in napa at tastings i have met many winemakers sommeliers and wine professionals
3654200 the first thing i tried that got me pumped up was a barolo whoa a light went off in my head i finally understood the difference between good wine and great wine a wine that awakens all your senses
3654201 im only 23 but people tell me i have an old soul my idea of a fun night is cognac and a fine cigar i have been through a war now i have found something i love i love wine and i love people every day i want to surround myself with something i love wine has absolutely changed my life

3654251 chiaro che gli europei stanno lanciando una campagna negativa contro lislam e i musulmani a dispetto delle loro richieste di dialogo interconfessionale e del rispetto dellaltro
3654252 a milano ogni venerd 3mila musulmani pregano senza che nessuno abbia messo in discussione la loro fede la nostra citt non ha mai dimostrato intolleranza e mi chiedo quante altre citt in europa di dimensioni simili a milano destinino cinque luoghi alla preghiera islamica il centro islamico di viale jenner non stato affatto chiuso

3654254 diversi luoghi di culto per i musulmani nelle citt di gallarate como treviso e in molte altre citt e nonostante tutto ci non c stata alcuna reazione da parte delle ambasciate dei paesi arabi e islamici e neppure da parte dei governi arabi per fermare questa politica discriminatoria
3654255 in precedenza la direzione dellistituto culturale islamico a milano aveva chiesto ai paesi arabi e islamici di intervenire per fermare la politica persecutoria del ministro degli interni italiano roberto maroni dopo la sua decisione di vietare la preghiera del venerd presso la sede dellistituto culturale islamico
3654256 someone else zeroed this rifle but i still have to completely rezero because shooters look at the sights differently

3654364 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court

3654379 this first year was a critical year now the patient is out of the icu but hes not ready to go home yet
3654380 what science has told us is that everything that we do can affect negatively or positively lake clarity since we are primarily a tourism community this is a huge economic issue for us
3654381 we were very worried it was a great relief to hear that the lake had not sustained the damage we had feared
3654382 this is my third straight year to come to your annual barbecue where is the barbecue
3654383 well pick it up for free and you dont even have to be home

3654386 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support
3654387 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
3654388 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
3654389 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california

3654407 im really please with how local businesses in redruth are welcoming this scheme anything kerrier district council and cpr regeneration can do to encourage good environmental practices and help keep redruth clean and tidy can only be a positive
3654408 the tidy business awards are a great opportunity for businesses to help improve the towns cleanliness and learn more about their waste responsibilities
3654409 litter free environments are important to residents and businesses that use the town regularly and we hope tourists and visitors will appreciate the efforts being made to improve redruth
3654410 we were delighted with the level of response from redruth businesses on the launch day people in the town showed an interest in participating in the scheme and it was great to hand out the new cotton bags to shoppers which will also help work towards creating a cleaner and greener town
3654411 it reflects the health system not being welcoming to our culture
3654412 thats the real gap i think were facing the ability to provide a medical home for a spectrum of this population
3654413 that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from the doctors
3654414 having a health care system thats comfortable and accepting for the hispanic population is much more than language
3654415 he has a bruised instep i think he will play today
3654416 after three strikeouts i was just trying to make contact
3654417 it certainly wasnt easy or smooth but we found a way to win
3654418 everyone is shocked to see mo give up a homer but young put the bat on the ball and kept it a foot inside the foul pole
3654419 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3654420 were going to win it next year if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
3654421 i know we have had a lot of injuries to deal with
3654422 im not writing off this season theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3654423 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3654424 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3654425 he just wants to make sure hes not a one hit wonder and theres some other singles coming out here in the near future
3654426 when you actually know what youre doing youre able to react a lot faster
3654427 now that ive got the playbook in my head im able to react and play faster
3654428 weve got some speed in our receiving corps but clowney definitely stands out one of his strengths is the deep ball he stretches the defense with his speed
3654429 any time you have speed thats a good thing offensively because you can get the ball down the field with favre and you have someone clowney that can get to where the ball can go
3654430 its one thing to line up in a stance and theres no one chasing you im not a track guy i play football when you put the pads on and its competition and youre going against people thats when you really find out what guys can do

3654438 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3654439 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3654440 they came up and told me i had the second guy
3654441 the nerves are still going to be there but once i get into a game and calm down a bit its smooth sailing
3654442 im not desperate but the issue down there is desperate
3654443 at this moment for me a john maine start is not as important as what we need in the bullpen
3654444 his situation is not as important as what we need to get those last outs its happened in our division with brett myers and john smoltz for me it helps the team when one of your guys says let me have it i know were struggling to me thats huge

3654464 action was taken against 385 persons 317 men and 68 women in 236 cases
3654465 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3654466 these nations still remember how in 1939 the soviet army crossed into their territory to purportedly defend the rights of ethnic minorities
3654467 in the baltic states and ukraine independence is still seen as something fragile and not necessarily built to last so if its not defended actively it cant last
3654468 people are certainly afraid that russia could attack lithuania just like georgia and you see that kind of view among politicians
3654469 were georgias closest friend in the region weve suffered the same kind of violence
3654470 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3654471 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler that led to world war ii to a huge tragedy and millions of victims

3654479 im looking forward to showing the splendour of the fleurieu peninsula to the wider world in the context of this powerful and emotional drama
3654480 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
3654481 anytime we can close out the game get the last six outs without a problem regardless of who it is its important for the bullpen
3654482 i think they all feel somewhat victorious in the sense that we were able to get those last six outs in a one run ballgame that was very big for us
3654483 when they talk about bringing in other people because you cant get the job done
3654484 monday was a rough game and we should have won but its one game we cant think about yesterday weve got to pick our heads up refresh our mind
3654485 theres not much you can do but hope they do the job
3654486 it is very stupid for georgia to start a war with russia because we are very big and they are very small but that is always the way in history with georgia
3654487 they probably dont even know the name of the georgian president
3654488 i met his wife at the athletes village the other day she was lovely
3654489 i want to congratulate them because i know theyre a good team
3654490 despite where we are from today i do not want there to be a war between us i respect them as players everyone is making this political but we did not want this at all
3654491 it has been extremely hard for our team to compete here in beijing because their minds have been on what is going on back home
3654492 it is far better to have contest in sport than anywhere else

3654500 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3654501 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3654502 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3654503 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3654504 off duty police officers last week forcibly removed a democratic party cameraman from a news conference where the seattle police officers guild was giving its endorsement to republican dino rossi
3654505 guild members threatened the young man with arrest and made an emergency call to 911 bringing uniformed officers to the scene cameraman kelly akers was warned about trespassing
3654506 akers was confronted by three off duty police officers and he says one or more grabbed him and pushed him out of the building once outside they continued to argue as the officers held akers in what he described as a
3654507 as akers was evicted from the office his camera recorded him saying in an increasingly loud and alarmed voice
3654508 i think that andrew young might simply share a lot of dna with john edwards
3654509 de andere belgen inspireren me dus het is de bedoeling om een belgisch record te zwemmen
3654510 hoeveel ik er wil onder duiken daarmee ben ik niet bezig ik zit in een goede reeks ik probeer in de wedstrijd zo lang mogelijk mee te gaan en op het einde zien we wel zenuwen heb ik niet echt ik moet gewoon met de gedachte zwemmen dat het een 1 500 meter is zoals al de andere die ik al heb gezwommen
3654511 het duurt wel heel lang het mag beginnen maar eigenlijk ben ik het wel gewoon ook de spelen zijn nog maar pas begonnen dus er zijn nog heel veel andere sporten bezig mijn kamergenoot mathieu fonteyn heeft zijn spelen er al op zitten maar ik zie hem niet veel zijn ouders zijn hier en hij trekt met hen de stad in
3654512 niet dat de technologie in de laptops zon grote vooruitgang heeft geboekt elke component afzonderlijk verbruikt nog evenveel stroom maar we hebben wel met onze proprietaire technieken het gebruik van de onderdelen beter afgestemd
3654513 het scherm wordt gedimd en we schakelen ongebruikte hardware uit een ethernetkaart hoeft helemaal geen stroom te krijgen als er geen internetaansluiting via ethernet is
3654514 een aantal operationeel directeuren heeft zich al manifest tegen gekleurde laptops uitgesproken ze zouden te makkelijk herkenbaar zijn en nog een eenvoudiger doelwit van diefstal maar een meerderheid ziet de kleuren wel zitten het is geen geheim dat we met de keuzemogelijkheid marktaandeel van onze concurrenten willen weghalen
3654515 ikzelf ben er dus klaar voor maar het wordt heel moeilijk om de finale te halen ik heb gezien dat er 62 meisjes zijn ingeschreven en slechts 15 mogen er daarvan naar de finale er zijn veel meisjes die de 5000m beu zijn en die het nu op de steeple proberen
3654516 ik loop natuurlijk liever s avonds maar op het wk vorig jaar in osaka was het ook al zo
3654517 dat betekent dat ik om 5u00 of 5u15 moet opstaan maar we zijn nu al een tijdje ook zo bezig dus zon probleem is het niet
3654518 als ik de finale wil halen zal ik sowieso risico moeten nemen
3654519 dat wil zeggen dat ik zelf het tempo in handen zal moeten nemen als het te traag gaat de verandering van de regels is wel niet in mijn voordeel vroeger gingen naast de 3 automatisch geplaatsten ook nog de 6 tijdsnelsten door maar nu gaan de eerste 4 van elke reeks en de 3 tijdsnelsten naar de finale
3654520 mijn plan was eigenlijk om bij die tijdsnelsten te zijn want met een tijd rond de 8 22 of 8 24 zat je daar normaal gezien bij nu wordt het tactisch moeilijker
3654521 stormen komen veel vaker voor tijdens de winter en daardoor verrast een zomerstorm vaak meer mensen ook wegens het grote aantal activiteiten in open lucht daardoor is de kans op schade en overlast groter dan bij een winterstorm van dezelfde kracht bovendien staan de bomen in blad en zijn daardoor gevoeliger voor forse windstoten

3654524 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3654525 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

3654529 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3654530 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3654531 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3654532 to find this out we urgently need to carry out further tests the appropriate research applications have already been submitted
3654533 people find these monotone sounds particularly unpleasant rather like the whining of a mosquito
3654534 these systems react autonomously to any change in frequency and damp the noise regardless of how fast the wind generator is turning
3654535 we have integrated sensors into the system they constantly measure the vibrations arising in the gearbox and pass on the results to the actuator control system

3654537 because we have the nrm caucus we are not allowed to express our personal views outside this body who says party members share similar views with other members no that cant happen
3654538 things are very bad in the party and when some of us talk they say that we are not nrm
3654539 she byenkya was right because there is infighting in the nrm but she was wrong because that was not the right forum for her to express those views
3654540 there are genuine complaints but there is also pettiness by people who dont want to be disciplined and are playing to the gallery

3654543 memprow is a response to the need for young women to develop personal empowerment skills and change their negative images of social worth as a way of enhancing their opportunities in a competitive environment
3654544 these are positive ways of expanding choices and opportunities for young women
3654545 i believe that understanding ones self worth will ultimately contribute towards the expansion of socio economic as well as leadership choices and opportunities
3654546 we have focused on rural women school drop outs and those in politics yet there are many being made pregnant because of fees
3654547 i have been doing this kind of work for 30 years my mother was a community development worker in the mothers union and she used to take me along to work with women groups in my holidays i remember holding womens hands to teach them to write and read english
3654548 i grew up knowing that empowering women was my cause im now a socialist in gender work
3654549 look at domestic roles and how they have been defined sexual gender based violence i also see families breaking up because the woman has not borne a baby boy girls thinking they cant do sciences because they have been made to believe so i may not change everything but i have the passion to make this world a better place for our girls
3654550 we just want equal opportunities let girls be kids as much as boys treat them equally
3654551 girls education was not much valued then but my parents were empowered as the only girl among four boys my mother sent me to boarding school at the age of five thinking i could not have the same opportunity to study like my brothers she thought dad would not support me but she was wrong he knew that it was the brain that mattered i was sent back home because i was too little
3654552 there was nothing to fight for in our home we were treated equally regardless of sex

3654559 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3654560 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3654561 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3654562 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure
3654563 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues
3654564 well i dont comment on any of that i just do my job
3654565 im sure in the not too distant future he will tell australians what he intends to do
3654566 i dont think anybody should underestimate how politically difficult it is going to be in the united states to pass legislation for an emissions trading scheme if there is not commitment and action coming from the other major emitters throughout the world
3654567 one of the key messages that from those that ive spoken to in both europe but particularly the united states is that we cannot afford to basically transfer money from low income american or australian households into the pockets of already wealthy people who are running utilities in other countries
3654568 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3654569 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3654570 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position

3654587 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3654588 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3654589 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3654590 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3654591 no aparecer en la tapa de los diarios tras ser descuartizada
3654592 hace cinco meses que decid separarme porque l intent asesinarme dos veces y nadie hace nada
3654593 el siempre fue violento pero desde hace dos a os comenz a amenazarme y a los chicos los hijos tienen entre dos y nueve a os les dice que me va a matar
3654594 el 25 de diciembre pasado me desfigur a golpes y luego me dijo que estaba arrepentido por no haberme matado directamente
3654595 all me dijeron que lo iban a notificar pero l sigue entrando y saliendo de la casa cuando quiere

3654601 as they approached they saw these guys and identified themselves as law enforcement
3654602 then one of the suspects who was holding a long gun turned toward the deputies as he turned he began to raise up his arm with the gun and two of the deputies opened fire
3654603 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3654604 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3654605 i kind of didnt know the score because there was so much going on everybody yelling and screaming
3654606 and when i was looking outside the ring looking for my teammates it sounded like some were saying move and some were saying fight
3654607 we were screaming to him to throw punches he said he heard someone saying for him to move he was looking up in the stands he thought they were saying move i know we were screaming
3654608 she probably was just upset and didnt want to sit home by herself and deal with it
3654609 maybe she was out for a walk or out for dinner
3654610 i think i did what anyone in a similar situation would have done
3654611 i really would like to meet that librarian to say thank you
3654612 now that this issue has been resolved i look forward to moving this case forward
3654613 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court
3654614 while we respect the courts decision we continue to believe that lane liroff and his office has a conflict of interest such they cannot be fair and evenhanded in their treatment of deshawn campbell because they continue to unconstitutionally seek the death penalty against a man who is mentally retarded

3654628 governor deval patrick is planning to release new regulations this morning that will take on powerful police unions by limiting construction details on nearly all state owned roads say several people who were briefed on the regulations
3654629 it no longer makes sense for people to work years at a job they may hate in order to amass a fortune before retiring and living the next 30 plus years of their lives feeling bored irrelevant and out of the mainstream
3654630 it is time to stop compartmentalizing work into the first part of our lives and leisure into the last part instead with the appropriate financial planning and the right change in attitude americans can begin living the lives they really want now not later and for those of us who simply cant afford to retire in the traditional sense its time to rethink how we approach the rest of our lives we can either sit back and give up or realize that we have the opportunity to reshape our futures

3654639 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3654640 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3654641 whilst it is true that the board has not made any formal decision to close the library ballymacarrett branch does not appear on the map of planned future provision which is of great concern to those who use it
3654642 we all recognise that there is a need to modernise library service provision but the local communitys needs must be fully considered as part of any planning process

3654646 i would like to welcome our new investors while thanking our existing shareholders for their ongoing support of the company
3654647 its everything i ever dreamed about on the podium i kept thinking back at it im almost at a loss for words
3654648 im just really pumped about the relay we talked about breaking seven minutes and we did it
3654649 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3654650 going into the 150m turn and the finish i couldnt see the wall they were getting more and more full of water throughout the race i was kind of upset it happened and then thats why i ripped those goggles off pretty quickly at the end
3654651 weve proven that wrong since were not out of water
3654652 but we need to develop new science and technology to make sure we can say that again in 2050 were now in a worldwide water crisis not just local crises
3654653 there is a 23 24 percent unforeseen increase in demand because it is being used in power generation
3654654 we have called a meeting of state oil companies to discuss shortages in some parts like maharashtra
3654655 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3654656 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
3654657 we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3654658 perhaps its the occassion of playing at the olympics you dont get a chance to play here often so i told myself i must do better
3654659 i dont want my tournament to end in the next match i want to do the best that i possibly can
3654660 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results
3654661 it is because of them that i am able to get this far
3654662 we all played very well the fielders hit especially well and scored a lot of runs so i could pitch wholeheartedly
3654663 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3654664 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3654665 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3654666 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3654667 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3654668 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3654669 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3654670 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3654671 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3654672 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks

3654675 c4cc expressed fears that a hasty shift to a federal form of government at this time and if undertaken in total disregard for social justice and development concerns will only strengthen the paralyzing influence of traditional politics over economic reforms particularly the agrarian reform program in the rural areas
3654676 if the political leaders have not carried out asset reforms in the countryside during the current period what is the assurance that they will push for these during a shift to a federal structure
3654677 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3654678 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3654679 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3654680 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3654681 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3654682 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3654683 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it
3654684 this movie made me cry yet made me happy somehow you made a movie on a buck toothed baby darsheel safary and still emerged successful
3654685 today when we are marketing cinema lives and values to make a film on special children is truly an act of courage
3654686 kata papa gak boleh beda bedain makanan kalau enak ya enak aja
3654687 the war is terrifying horrifying for civilians and we cant let it go on the french presidency of the european union council like all the countries of the eu is concerned and sometimes indignant at what is happening on its doorstep we must therefore try together with the americans and with the russians of course who are a participant in this conflict to stop the killing
3654688 nggak ada persaingan di sini kita seneng sama sama masuk nominasi
3654689 were waiting to find out but there are so many leaders in the team and whoever it is im convinced will do a great job for the country
3654690 there will be a lot on their shoulders but they will do a great job jt and rio are both great players they are both top central defenders and both would be equally deserving of the captains armband if they got it as would steven gerrard as would david beckham to be honest
3654691 its not up to me to say who should get it but what i can say is that whoever gets it will have the 100 support of the lads and of the manager and of the whole country

3654699 she made a mistake but was able to come back
3654700 its pretty amazing to have four olympic medals not many people have them and a lot of people are trying for them its pretty shocking actually
3654701 i had tutored a lot of athletes but i saw her will to learn and to give 100 percent even in her academics
3654702 she has gone from being a power diver to becoming a graceful one
3654703 she has learned to use the board her diving is more flowing and she has the high list in degree of difficulty
3654704 im seeing a lot more focus in her her husband is a wonderful person and she has enjoyed having someone who is excited about what she does

3654718 some of the conclusions of this report are as its authors admit barmy they demonstrate a clear lack of understanding of the north east and sunderland in particular its value to the regional economy and the pride of its people in their city
3654719 you either shut yourself off to it completely or you let it eat you alive
3654720 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3654721 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3654722 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3654723 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3654724 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3654725 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more

3654727 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week

3654746 it was mainly his physical talent and real competitiveness that stood out
3654747 a number of things make him the swimmer he is but i think it is largely psychological he can relax and focus on what he is doing when under pressure and actually this sort of environment makes him perform better
3654748 he was always a big string bean and he was very awkward

3654755 the five day battle between russia and georgia that killed hundreds if not thousands has turned santanna and martins an obscure pair of brazilians into proxies for a war torn people they barely know

3654757 its very important for the georgian people to make a small happiness
3654758 my answer is simple lets fight on the fields not outside of them

3654800 the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to infertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction

3654850 by this time the victim had fallen to the ground so you then took his jerry can and struck him on the head or face with it some four or five times
3654851 it is apparent that the attack upon him was not motivated by some purpose such as retaliation or theft and in one sense it is much worse for that
3654852 it has been submitted and i accept that in a sad way it has taken an event of this magnitude to perhaps bring you to your senses
3654853 the steady decrease of the ability to provide for the welfare of its nation serves to decrease the bond between nation and state lowering the barriers to entry of alternate overlapping affinity networks this results in either the reversion of marginalized populations to their primary loyalties the adoption by that population of supra national loyalties or both primary loyalties the small scale local or ethnic affinity networks that emerge in times of chaos are particularly effective at fomenting the breakdown of national cohesion the continual hierarchical intensification of the process of globalization is steadily fueling the worldwide emergence of competing networks of primary loyalties which are co spatial and contemporaneous to the national foundations of the nation state these include networks based on religious identity economic caste micro cultural affiliation and geographic locality because these networks rarely coincide spatially with nation state borders their very existence contradicts the cartesian notion of the constitutional nature of modern nation states increasingly these networks of primary loyalties are blending not behind a single ideological or political platform but behind a unifying non hierarchal organizational principle rhizome for now this organizational principle is most visibly embodied by the phenomena of international terrorism the rise in international terrorism is perhaps the final straw that when combined with the influences of multiculturalism and globalization destroys the legitimacy of the nation state the nation state system is predicated upon the twin principles of sovereignty a domestic monopoly on the use of violence and a singular focus for inter state violence terrorism invalidates both claims exacerbated by reactionary ideologies and the expanding economic inequality brought by globalization terrorism undermines the states role of security provider additionally as independent international actors both terrorist organizations and multinational corporations represent their own interests unconstrained by either a cartesian notion of nation state borders or the prevailing interests of a national constituency terrorism represents the merger of the military force of the state and the overlapping non cartesian geography of non state networks in a world freed of the rigid boundaries of the nation state system and with the substantial overlapping web of affiliation and connectivity created by emerging global terrorist organizations the stage is set for a defining conflict that will replace the last vestiges of the nation state with the new map
3654854 fueled by the breakdown of cartesian order the spread of multiculturalism and technological advancements in communication and transportation the hierarchal process of globalization is forcing the nation state to evolve or die
3654855 disparity and economic desperation is the fuel that supports the reactionary flame of terrorism
3654856 at present the phenomena of international terrorism is the most publicly visible example of this rhizome opposition the watershed innovation of todays terrorism is not its military efficacy however but its use of rhizome structure to confront the hierarchical establishment
3654857 on the most fundamental level the challenges of the new map must be met with policy that embraces rhizome

3654865 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3654866 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3654867 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3654868 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3654869 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3654870 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3654871 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3654872 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3654873 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3654879 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3654880 georgia is a stable state and is developing an investor friendly low cost environment
3654881 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3654882 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3654883 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3654884 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3654885 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3654886 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3654887 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3654888 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3654889 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3654890 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados

3654892 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3654893 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3654894 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week

3654899 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3654900 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3654901 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen

3654908 theyre from brossard or st jean sur richelieu theyre not used to black people theyre not used to immigrants so when they come here they remember images from the tv and theyre ready they walk like this
3654909 this isnt a dangerous neighbourhood i have four kids and i raise them here they go to school around the corner ive been living on the same street for 14 years and ive never seen any signs of danger
3654910 usually theyre sitting just over there playing dice talking and smoking cigarettes not harming anyone
3654911 i mean it happened in a park my son was out riding his bike at the time can you imagine how nervous i was who in their right mind shoots their gun off in a park
3654912 its often people from laval who cant do what they want over there so they come over here and when theyre done making trouble they leave
3654913 thats why were doing this project i was hoping to get this done before things like this happened again
3654914 i know theyre getting anxious but if we can get the one single zoning bylaw through it makes it easier to amend for all kinds of issues
3654915 to point fingers at anybody at this point we just dont know
3654916 we have a significant robust safety system in place today
3654917 its absolutely insane and woefully inadequate if youve set yourself up as the public safety watchdog for that industry sector
3654918 i think what this has shown us is the approved regulator may well be asleep at the switch
3654919 we need to understand what caused the explosion to understand how we can best move to protect the residents of toronto
3654920 piata valuara este linistita iar leul evolueaza asemanator cu zlotul sau forintul
3654921 pe piata monetara operatiunea repo efectuata ieri marti n r de catre banca centrala a determinat o scadere semnificativa a dobanzilor overnight
3654922 after receiving cash from various sources della porta allegedly deposited less cash than the union received and pocketed the balance
3654923 we didnt know what was wrong and we called our accountants
3654924 they said its a very skilled person who can do that
3654925 but im very glad that the department of labor has finally concluded its investigation and has decided to take action against her
3654926 its going to be even more than that as we move closer to fall
3654927 as long as fuel remains over 100 a barrel the airlines will re evaluate their market profitability and adjust schedules accordingly
3654928 they cant sustain a high level of service with these high fuel prices
3654929 air indias flights out of lax were light they were not daily and they competed with nonstop service to india out of san francisco so this was not much of a surprise
3654930 we have to maximize our earnings during this difficult period which is why we are moving our capacity
3654931 however while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money
3654932 the fuel prices combined with the declining value of the dollar is a double whammy for the domestic carriers who offer international flights
3654933 the international carriers offering overseas flights are actually seeing less of a hit in comparison
3654934 this whole situation of airlines cutting back on international flights has the regions travel and tourism industry in a very very nervous state
3654935 you have the airlines facing both high fuel costs but demand is also softening and people are not traveling as much so that packs a one two punch for carriers who are struggling to stay alive
3654936 at the end of preparation the bean flour cake rolls in the soybean flour and looks like a donkey rolling over
3654937 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3654938 he said he did it for the adrenaline rush for the challenge
3654939 community night out march and rally against crime and violence
3654940 we can do a much better job if we are all working together
3654941 all nationalities together in georgia the armenians the azeris the georgians and the ossetians we will be together we will win together we will win
3654942 we will never surrender and we will tell this to the enemy thousands and thousands of times
3654943 we are a nation of warriors and we will fight until the end we will destroy the russians and retake gori well drive them out of south ossetia and well take back abkhazia as well onwards
3654944 i and a lot of my friends used to be against him
3654945 but hes our president we elected him and if we dont like him well remove him ourselves without russia this war has made georgia united
3654946 the situation is very difficult in the country i think that there is no time for internal political disputes
3654947 under such conditions it is an unwritten law internal political confrontations and disputes should be stopped
3654948 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3654949 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3654950 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3654951 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3654952 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3654953 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3654954 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3654955 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3654956 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3654957 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3654958 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3654959 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3654960 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3654961 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3654962 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3654963 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3654964 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3654965 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3654966 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3654967 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3654968 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3654969 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3654970 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3654971 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3654972 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3654973 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3654974 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3654975 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3654976 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3654977 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3654978 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3654979 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3654980 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3654981 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3654982 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3654983 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3654984 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3654985 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3654986 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3654987 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3654988 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3654989 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3654990 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3654991 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3654992 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3654993 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3654994 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3654995 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3654996 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3654997 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3654998 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3654999 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3655000 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3655001 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3655002 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3655003 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3655004 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3655005 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3655006 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3655007 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3655008 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3655009 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3655010 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3655011 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3655012 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3655013 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3655014 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3655015 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3655016 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3655017 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3655018 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3655019 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3655020 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3655021 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3655022 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3655023 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3655024 i ever only had one car because the other was a government jag

3655028 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3655029 how to get the most entertainment for your video gaming dollar
3655030 whether the heats or the final are in the morning and the afternoon does not matter to us in terms of performance
3655031 i think in this day any loyalty is very lacking in sport and i think that often money talks too loudly
3655032 i just think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed
3655033 i hate to lose getting third in the 200 four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me even more in the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 especially underwater
3655034 ive been eating a lot of pasta and pizza a lot of carbs
3655035 ive been sleeping as much as i can i get two massages a day ice baths ive been able to physically recover very well

3655037 there should be little doubt that the israeli government is making every effort to jump start a war against iran sooner rather than later many israelis not surprisingly believe it is in their interest to convince the united states to attack iran so that israel will not have to do it and they are hell bent on bringing that about unfortunately their efforts are being aided and abetted by a u s mainstream media that is unwilling to ask any hard questions or challenge the assumptions of the israeli government
3655038 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

3655050 editors note the bush administrations push for access to oil from the caspian sea and its desire to isolate iran precipitated the russian invasion of georgia william o beeman is professor and chair of the department of anthropology at the university of minnesota he has lived and worked in the middle east region for more than 30 years no one should be surprised that u s interference in the caucasus has led to the russian invasion of south ossetia by mixing into the volatile politics of the caucasus and trying to recruit the governments there to become american plumbers for a variety of purposes the united states has only drawn russian fire

3655065 we are not going to sacrifice the lives of our soldiers to defend you
3655066 need not be the document that should contain all the details that would resolve all questions and doubts the peace process will continue even after it is signed with goodwill patience and wisdom and consultation such further steps will surely resolve substantive questions
3655067 that is part of being at a big club the pressure of expectation is always very high its a big day with a big meaning for us because the target is very high to be in the champions league
3655068 klein dass man es mit einem trick hindurchschaffen w rde oder stelle ich nach 30 metern sprint fest dass doch schon mehr brennt als mir lieb sein d rfte
3655069 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3655070 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3655071 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3655072 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3655073 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3655074 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3655075 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3655076 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3655077 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3655078 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3655079 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3655080 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3655081 real results by the end of my first term in office
3655082 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3655083 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3655084 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3655085 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3655086 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3655087 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3655088 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3655089 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3655090 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3655091 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3655092 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3655093 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3655094 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3655095 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3655096 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3655097 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3655098 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3655099 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3655100 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3655101 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3655102 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3655103 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3655104 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3655105 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3655106 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3655107 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3655108 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3655109 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3655110 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3655111 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3655112 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3655113 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3655114 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3655115 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3655116 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3655117 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3655118 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3655119 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3655120 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3655121 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

3655123 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3655124 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3655125 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3655126 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3655127 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3655128 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3655129 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3655130 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time
3655131 some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
3655132 during the course of the first couple of days of the olympics im in hong kong and then i have to go back to the states because i have some business and then im off to detroit thats where ill be my son is in a basketball tournament there and my wife and i will be there for that
3655133 two jews and a black man help phelps fulfill olympic dream

3655139 the fighting in georgia has answered the question that world leaders have been asking since vladimir putin stepped down as president this year who runs russia
3655140 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
3655141 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks
3655142 altemeyer prepared a digest of his research for general readers which he has posted online for one and all to examine at no cost
3655143 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
3655144 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells
3655145 in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
3655146 finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

3655154 die nordamerikaner f hren den globalen trend bei den n hrwertangaben an aber die verbraucher im asiatisch pazifischen raum haben in den letzten drei jahren rasch aufgeholt
3655155 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
3655156 berkinger das mineralwasser mit dem mehr an mineralien ist ein wichtiger energielieferant f r menschen die im sport und im alltag alles geben aufgrund der sportlichen orientierung und regionalen verbundenheit engagiert sich berkinger als partner und sponsor besonders f r den regionalen breiten und mannschaftssport mit schwerpunkt auf fu ball handball und leichathletik da passt das engagement beim fc augsburg nat rlich perfekt ins bild und wir freuen uns schon sehr auf die zusammenarbeit mit dem fu ball zweitligisten
3655157 berkinger ist die bekannteste mineralwassermarke s ddeutschlands und gilt hier als inbegriff des erfrischenden belebenden mineralwassers ich bin mir sicher dass unsere kooperation sehr erfolgreich verlaufen wird
3655158 es freut uns sehr dass eine traditionsmarke wie berkinger den fca und die fans im stadion k nftig erfrischen wird und den verein mit verschiedenen werbema nahmen f r sich und seine unternehmenskommunikation nutzt
3655159 eine enorme schlagzahl die die hohe kompetenz von t v s d als internationaler projektentwickler unterstreicht
3655160 das tempo ist enorm die mitarbeiter stehen unter gro em druck sehen aber auch die erfolge
3655161 vielen schien es damals unm glich diese ziele zu erreichen wir haben aber immer daran geglaubt den ambitionierten zeitplan halten zu k nnen
3655162 damit haben wir dann in 15 monaten projektlaufzeit in einem kulturell und entwicklungspolitisch unglaublich vielschichtigen land ein netzwerk von fast 200 stationen aufgebaut und 2000 mitarbeiter rekrutiert und ausgebildet das d rfte in unserer branche weltweit einmalig sein
3655163 sitze ich nicht nur im b ro sondern habe auch kontakt zu den mitarbeitern und komme auch mal in andere betriebe herein
3655164 bei uns bewarben sich zw lf schulabg nger auf die ausbildungsstelle doppelt soviel als wir erwartet hatten
3655165 try to find an ugly chinese child and take a picture of him or her
3655166 amazon will sell up to 380 000 kindles in 2008 up from a previous forecast of 190 000
3655167 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3655168 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3655169 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3655170 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3655171 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3655172 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3655173 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3655174 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3655175 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3655176 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3655177 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3655178 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3655179 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3655180 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3655181 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3655182 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3655183 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3655184 oh no this can only mean that they are out of water because they are arabs in the west bank and oppressed and occupied
3655185 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3655186 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3655187 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3655188 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3655189 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3655190 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3655191 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3655192 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3655193 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3655194 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3655195 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3655196 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3655197 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3655198 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3655199 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3655200 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3655201 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3655202 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3655203 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3655204 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3655205 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3655206 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3655207 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3655208 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3655209 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3655210 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3655211 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3655212 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3655213 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3655214 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3655215 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3655216 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3655230 aditya you will continue expanding your knowledge of the way consult the great book of wikipedia and use it to guide you in this task but you must also begin the great work upon the world to find all those who do not follow the way of progressive metal and to teach them the way so that they may be enlightened as well you must show them the error of their ways and when they accept the way into their heart they will be forgiven of all their musical sins and will be accepted into octavarium the divine land those who reject your words and continue in falsehood will be punished

3655257 no you cant major in biology because you flunked a class that over gnoltac this stuff is comedy gold gen g 2 he went to college when he was 29 am
3655258 my father did it my sister did it my mother does it my friend did it and its caused me to have to evaluate the sort of relationships i have with people im certainly not indifferent about the fact that ive been hurt or insulted so its not as if its difficult to tell and i give people the benefit of the doubt at every turn
3655259 i just wish i could find friends that understood that consequences exist to actions
3655260 we only get one shot at this one mistake and were all done
3655261 see you all in heaven thanks and its been fun

3655267 well yeh the tragic reality of 21st century life is that creativity art expression innovation has been ripped away from the quest for personal achievement and stripped from the purview of the masses
3655268 no you cant major in biology because you flunked a class that over 50 of the class flunked simply because you poked yourself with a clean sterilized needle when you were removing it from a stuck case
3655269 my best friend was a total dick to me a couple days ago so that may be over the one friend that i can trust is way younger than me thats about it
3655270 im trying my best to maintain self control but im getting really tired of people trying to screw me over or stab me in the back or attack me and then coming back and acting as if its all right
3655271 my father did it my sister did it my mother does it my friend did it and its caused me to have to evaluate the sort of relationships i have with people im certainly not indifferent about the fact that ive been hurt or insulted so its not as if its difficult to tell and i give people the benefit of the doubt at every turn
3655272 i just wish i could find friends that understood that consequences exist to actions
3655273 we only get one shot at this one mistake and were all done
3655274 see you all in heaven thanks and its been fun
3655275 so i googled you and you were in this second life thing and it was called patriotic nigras and would you care to explain
3655276 hes a polite likable young man i didnt detect a trace of arrogance in him
3655277 for now however lances goals arent so atypical from those of any 16 year old get a job buy a car get that drivers license
3655278 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3655279 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3655280 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3655281 understanding that there are differences among employees and that these differences if properly managed are an asset to work being done more efficiently and effectively
3655282 what is the principal reason for resisting the idea of change due to the safeway take over
3655283 your sic an idiot for being a gamer who has sold out to shock value and bloodlust
3655284 my friend who happens to be religious said this dumb thing about a game therefore religious people say dumb things about religion
3655285 god doesnt exist because i dont want to have to believe in him
3655286 if you want people to treat you respectfully despite your beliefs shouldnt you do the same to others
3655287 these fallacies arent limited to thought on religious matters nor are they limited to religious people
3655288 oh crap did i just jump to the conclusion that the article was about religious people when it actually wasnt
3655289 those that are explicitly and assuredly atheists will do so less than those that are explicitly and assuredly religious
3655290 but its not even necessarily because of fear or lack of interest but it follows that its because theyve been told not to
3655291 if god is truly powerful then i have nothing to fear from considering this opposing viewpoint
3655292 willing to face new ideas and information based on their confidence that it wont tip their boat
3655293 be open minded but not so much that your brains fall out
3655294 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3655295 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no
3655296 a lot of this has caught the americans by surprise
3655297 politicians have been on the project of supporting democracy in the former soviet union without thinking of the impact in russia now were seeing a reaction
3655298 but now that it has come up against major opposition i think the inability of the u s to mount an effective response is going to call into question washingtons ability to push back
3655299 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
3655300 saakashvili made a huge mistake and soon these things should be discussed
3655301 newspapers in pakistan im afraid dream up things then start writing about them theres no such thing
3655302 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes
3655303 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3655304 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3655305 for decision makers in the nato countries of the west it would be worth considering whether in future you want the men and women of your armed services to be answerable to mr saakashvilis declarations of war in the caucasus
3655306 im pumped about our relay we talked about breaking seven minutes and we had two guys who averaged 1 45 or better they really did it and pulled it out for the team
3655307 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together
3655308 everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that we have been able to do that
3655309 het is nu eerst zaak het geweld definitief te stoppen en terug te keren naar de situatie van voor het begin van het conflict dan kunnen we streven naar een meer structurele oplossing
3655310 i think sometime in august i hope to come to conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3655311 im just trying to bring my mind to a point where i can make a good decision whether or not im going to play hockey right now

3655317 el prefecto de oruro finalmente que se aline desde el principio al mas al igual que el prefecto de potos ha tenido tambi n una votaci n negativa de rechazo a su gesti n esto podr a ser mal interpretado como un rechazo al mas y no es as es m s bien una gran bondad de la democracia y sabidur a del pueblo el voto revocatorio fue un reflejo del rechazo total de la poblaci n a una p sima gesti n realizada por este ex prefecto que seg n dicen los orure os no hizo nada oruro es una de las ciudades mas atrasadas de bolivia pero por otro lado la votaci n en apoyo a la gesti n de evo morales y el vicepresidente fue abrumadora al igual que en todo el occidente superior al 80 por el si lo cual significar a que en una nueva elecci n de prefecto si el mas pone a un candidato serio el pueblo lo votar con todo

3655343 georgia and russia are careening towards war and the u s isnt exactly a detached observer in the fight the american military has been training and equipping georgian troops for years
3655344 stagflation record energy prices a powerful russia and proxy wars happy times are here again theres even an actor governing california give it time
3655345 the anti russian bias of the western media is really something to behold
3655346 the prime minister has accused washington of undermining russias attempts to restore peace in the south ossetian conflict zone vladimir putin said a decision by the us military to fly 800 georgian soldiers from iraq to georgia showed america was trying to get in the way
3655347 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3655348 the united states is georgias closest ally it maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack it is very difficult to imagine that the georgians launched their attack against u s wishes the georgians rely on the united states and they were in no position to defy it this leaves two possibilities the first is a massive breakdown in intelligence in which the united states either was unaware of the existence of russian forces or knew of the russian forces but along with the georgians miscalculated russias intentions the second is that the united states along with other countries has viewed russia through the prism of the 1990s when the russian military was in shambles and the russian government was paralyzed the united states has not seen russia make a decisive military move beyond its borders since the afghan war of the 1970s 1980s the russians had systematically avoided such moves for years the united states had assumed that the russians would not risk the consequences of an invasion

3655361 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3655362 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term

3655364 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3655365 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3655366 the quota system can act as a barrier but there are cases when there are people who cannot be brought forward it helps them in getting them on board

3655369 the current correction in reits is comparable to that of the more dramatic corrections of the past 35 years
3655370 we have therefore had to cancel this sundays planned interview with nationals maurice williamson on the partys infrastructure policies
3655371 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3655372 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3655373 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3655374 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3655375 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3655376 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3655377 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3655378 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3655379 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3655380 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3655381 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3655382 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3655383 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3655384 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3655385 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3655386 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3655387 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3655388 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3655389 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3655390 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3655391 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3655392 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3655393 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3655394 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3655395 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3655396 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3655397 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3655398 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3655399 credit fears are rising again after the news from jpmorgan with the fall on wall street overnight that will weigh today
3655400 with real policy rates in the region set to fall both economies are likely to see a more protracted spell of high inflation a risk that will be exacerbated if the trade term gains over the past years are to reverse course going forward
3655401 another challenge will come from potential adjustments in external balance in reaction to lower real returns on the regions financial assets that could undermine the supply of foreign funding to the domestic financial sectors
3655402 there could be news within the next couple of days or next week
3655403 if we get a situation indicating that this is going to happen quickly we would feel much better about life

3655409 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3655410 realistic about the ability of cities such as newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as and sunderland
3655411 the political turmoil and directionless economic situation is creating pressure on the rupee
3655412 we didnt see any new looting at the eight sites which was really very very encouraging
3655413 if there was major recent looting there we would have expected to find it
3655414 but i didnt see anything that was there in late 2003 or early 2004
3655415 tens of thousands of military boots tramping over an archaeological site is not what we want
3655416 the ongoing problem is not so much looting or military damage it is the fact that these sites have faced 30 years of neglect
3655417 the lack of resources for the iraqi department of antiquities means they simply havent been able to inspect the sites or do conservation or restoration work
3655418 we should not have a long discussion on how to respond to the escalation of the last days the eu must decide which role she wants to play in the future
3655419 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3655420 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3655421 what we should be talking about is food security not food production
3655422 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3655423 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate
3655424 safety will always be our top priority on this issue
3655425 also the mtdna genome is much smaller than the nuclear genome
3655426 thats what let us finish this genome well before we finish the nuclear genome
3655427 diminish the power of natural selection to remove slightly deleterious evolutionary changes
3655428 if there were only a few small bands of neanderthals barely hanging on then any change to their way of life could have been enough to drive them to extinction
3655429 one obvious change would have been the introduction of another large hominid modern humans
3655430 the study shows that at least for the maternal lineage there are no traceable genetic markers that suggest admixture of neanderthals and modern humans
3655431 he said to me mom im alive im safe and ill be back oh i cant tell you how relieved i am its been a living nightmare for five days i didnt know where he was ive already lost one son its enough in my life i cannot support my government in this war i cannot but i support my georgia
3655432 we have a feeling that hes acting too much to the west to his allies to the foreign and especially western media we were surprised as well that he makes so many statements in english he knows the public face of his work and i think he does it very well and i think these last days hes been giving a lot of interviews with cnn the bbc and other channels he knows what hes doing
3655433 i dont believe saakashvilis image will be better after this war after so many dead how can his image be better in georgia
3655434 it doesnt matter if he speaks english or not he speaks russian very well too its not about image its about political and economic interest saakashvili thinks that for georgia its better to be with the west and the west have put a lot of money into georgia this is why they deal with each other
3655435 the injured man and woman had been fighting with each other following a fight between their teenaged daughters
3655436 during the altercation the man was jumped by the woman and her son and struck in the head by a four by four fence post before a sword and knife were brought into the mix
3655437 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3655438 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3655439 of course youre going to root for the american team
3655440 since 2001 the tjala arts centre has grown by almost 100 per cent as a result of an increase in art sales
3655441 many artists working at the center have achieved national and international reputations and the center is now recognized as a provider of high quality work
3655442 people living in remote communities face unique challenges and we need to do what we can to help them support themselves
3655443 a new arts center will give the amata community the scope and opportunity it needs to maintain and even increase the positive momentum it has gained through its production of a range of art works
3655444 the money we have received from boston mayflower will be going on the purchase of much needed equipment for the station
3655445 we will also use it for the funding of our ofcom licence fees
3655446 this will allow us to continue the stations programming and bring the community of boston closer
3655447 we chose stump radio for an award because it presented a unique opportunity for boston mayflower to develop its communication with the community
3655448 we recognise community radio as a great opportunity to engage our communities
3655449 authorise the council or its agents to make enquiries to corroborate this claim
3655450 permit the council or its agents to inspect the property on request
3655451 day by day under labour the rights and liberties of law abiding citizens are being undermined with more and more state officials trying to enter and spy on peoples homes
3655452 it may be appropriate for local authorities to check that council tax discounts are not wrongly claimed
3655453 but it is wholly disproportionate to threaten higher council tax bills if residents do not allow state officials into their bedrooms
3655454 this is another worrying sign of function creep state duties originally intended to tackle fraud are now being over used by bureaucrats in a heavy handed intrusive manner
3655455 i fear such state intrusion is a sign of things to come with an army of bureaucrats currently being trained to enter homes across the country for gordon browns council tax revaluation
3655456 the guide to councils which dates as far back as 2004 merely replicated as an example what one council had put together to tackle fraudulent claims for single person discounts in their area
3655457 we have also repeatedly said that no council tax revaluation will take place during the lifetime of this parliament
3655458 yet again these stories only serve to make vulnerable people particularly the elderly needlessly frightened
3655459 everyone would agree that councils should take measures to ensure that those people who claim the single person discount on their council tax are eligible to do so
3655460 it is up to individual councils to appropriately use the powers that they have to do this
3655461 wir haben viel ge ndert und alles ist nach plan gelaufen
3655462 wenn man nichts wagt wird man auch keinen champagner trinken
3655463 then it got tighter than i would have wanted it to
3655464 i pulled a muscle in the first game and it was getting worse and worse and worse
3655465 it started bothering me at the beginning of the match
3655466 vooral omdat het mijn beste match ooit was tegen haar ze heeft een heel goede worp en die heb ik kunnen blokkeren maar dan verlies ik met een golden score het is geen kwestie van fysiek want ik denk dat zij zelfs kapotter zat dan ik ik moet de beelden nog eens bekijken maar ik denk dat zij heeft overgenomen en zo heeft gescoord
3655467 voor hetzelfde geld had ik echter kunnen winnen iets voordien had ik haar in een armklem maar de scheidsrechter zei dat ik op haar kin aan het werken was terwijl ik enkel haar kraag vast had
3655468 ik had gedacht dat scapin wel door zou gaan want ze is heel sterk en heeft heel veel ervaring
3655469 ik heb haar kamp echter niet gezien maar ik denk dat ze verrast is geweest misschien was ze iets te laat geconcentreerd
3655470 ik ga nu even uitblazen maar het is absoluut niet de bedoeling om te stoppen
3655471 ik heb er absoluut nog zin in en ik voelde me hier eindelijk voor de eerste keer in twee jaar weer goed ik heb hard op mijn tanden moeten bijten om te staan waar ik nu sta dus ik ga er nu zeker niet de brui aan geven
3655472 nicole cooke has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal
3655473 its not only gold but its team gbs 200th gold medal from the modern olympic games
3655474 if that flag really does represent turkish cypriots as claimed how is that the cyprus olympic team introduced by christofias does not even have one turkish cypriot on it he should explain why a single turkish cypriot is not taking part in the olympics
3655475 what turns you on more my pretty face or my sexy body
3655476 you are about to read the most important information that is available to you today you will achieve a better understanding about bronchitis
3655477 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods
3655478 it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3655479 consumer habits are shifting people shop around at different outlets several times a week so its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
3655480 we are glad to partner with department of health in this important project
3655481 convenience stores trade at the heart of communities of all kinds throughout the country
3655482 they provide choice and convenience to all and for some more vulnerable consumers provide invaluable access to food and services
3655483 selling healthy food fruit and vegetables in particular is an area where we have seen tremendous innovation and investment
3655484 working with dh we have an opportunity to facilitate the penetration of these changes deep into even the most deprived communities
3655485 working together we can bring not only the access but also the messages about healthy choices to the consumers that need it most
3655486 whats happening why are so many people eating corn all of a sudden i better get in on that so i dont look stupid
3655487 will reduce the use of diesel cut air pollution and help the country achieve its goal in saving energy and curbing pollution
3655488 les fans font partie de ce club et leur aide et tr s importante
3655489 si on se bat ils comprennent ce que nous faisons et ils savent quil y aura des moments avec et des moments sans pendant le match le plus important cest de tout donner
3655490 lobjectif de tait de nous permettre de nous mettre au travail tout de suite
3655491 nous nous sommes bien pr par s et nous avons tudi notre adversaire mais le plus important sera notre performance
3655492 je naimerais pas que mes joueurs perdent face une quipe uniquement pour une question de prestige bien s r il est possible que nous perdions car cest le football mais nous jouons une quipe qui peut aussi faire des erreurs ils auront une grosse pression beaucoup plus que nous je suis s r quils auront des moments dh sitation et si nous savons en profiter
3655493 its a good thing to have though you cant go out to practice and have a cold day and not get better we have a lot of good backs at this school right now its competitive every day but its fun
3655494 id say all those guys right now theyve not separated themselves from the others
3655495 hes no 2 on the depth chart but every day these guys go out and compete for their jobs hes being pushed and hes doing a good job
3655496 there were some situations this spring with pass protection but hes sharpened that up he works extremely hard and hes got young guys pushing him every day
3655497 me and javon are very competitive at everything we could be at home playing uno and wed be trying to win all the time
3655498 its not bad but we are very competitive with each other on the field we just go at it
3655499 when i first came in john l and coach dave baldwin said i could be the third back ringer and i went at it but he can pass block better than me when it came down to it i couldnt pass block very well and he got the job and i didnt i just worked hard at it and came back strong this year ive really perfected it way better blocking picking up things knowing the schemes and just working hard
3655500 a j is a guy who ive seen in the last year or two boy his work ethic is much better and hes worked extremely hard

3655504 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii i hope the british board of film classification will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification without that it cannot be marketed in britain what the rest of the world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3655505 hydraulic energy from small dams is interesting because of its low environmental costs but everything has its limits
3655506 we predict that there will be fewer fish as a result of the energy projects on local rivers begun around 10 years ago because the dams block the fish from swimming upriver to breed
3655507 the affected rivers which are already polluted by agro chemical runoff flow towards the park where they form the xinga river and as a result the problems will be aggravated

3655527 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3655528 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3655529 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3655530 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3655531 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3655532 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3655533 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3655534 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3655535 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3655536 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3655537 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3655538 the governor i think was looking for what this meant when sen french was making the statements he did
3655539 and we were trying to give her a better idea of what this could possibly mean so were just trying to do a prudent inquiry to cover her options
3655540 i think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved
3655541 even before he named an investigator he went to the national media with a fairly serious concept so we began an internal review
3655542 my view is that they are perfectly free to try to ascertain for themselves what happened
3655543 until i learn otherwise im going to assume that its on the up and up
3655544 so the investigator himself actually asked us to do the very type of thing we were doing we were doing it before he asked for it but its not inconsistent
3655545 im gratified that a substantial number of people chose to vote for me even though i wasnt eligible
3655546 i know a lot of emphasis is always put on money but its going to take getting out into the district and letting the voters know that you care about them
3655547 its not in anyones hands right now in my opinion it has always been in the hands of the voters
3655548 were ready to work as hard for the next 2 1 2 months as weve worked in the last 2 1 2 weeks
3655549 i appreciated his integrity and how he represented boulder city and thats one of the things ill miss the most
3655550 i dont know when well have somebody like that again
3655551 hes lived in the same house raised four kids right here in town and is the pride of the community in my estimation
3655552 of course boulder city is home and its a wonderful place with great people
3655553 we have to make sure that the interests of boulder city are protected on the county level and its going to be number one on my list of items to go over with my successor and even before the election to go over with the candidates
3655554 as much i loved our commissioner i believe in them
3655555 it would have been really simple for them to just say pay the interest ive given up the supreme court
3655556 it is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping
3655557 having said that were going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close
3655558 the legally correct amount necessary to deter exxon and others from future oil spills
3655559 but the reality is the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs so we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court its really in the ninth circuits hands
3655560 lets get this creative online sportsbook copy project underway and take cues from www mpaa org as needed

3655563 because with nearly every copy sold the author is rich
3655564 law educationm particularly in the creative online sportsbook copy field is changing every day
3655565 while we were investigating we saw a good heavy dark skid mark that didnt align with any of the vehicles
3655566 this is a narrow road with fast speeds and a lot of cars
3655567 ive seen tourists get off at the bus stop near the golf course and walk along here to the zoo
3655568 right now for example omalley has design funds but no right of way funds until 2010
3655569 weve enjoyed getting a lot of our improvements done with federal funding and thats what is declining
3655570 what weve seen over the years from dot is completely overbuilt and tends to speed up traffic which is a concern of everybody here
3655571 we want to keep the speed down thats a serious issue on omalley
3655572 its a rural minded neighborhood in an urban setting we want trails and we want wilderness but we have this surge of cars every day we cant have it both ways
3655573 obviously you do not care much about greece or cyprus for greece will never fight a war with turkey

3655592 the sufa nahal oz and erez crossings were reopened this morning
3655593 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3655594 the tibetan protesters were in the park john ray was running behind them the police was running behind him
3655595 we always had security arrangements in place even before they could fully start the demonstration we had them under control
3655596 petitioners have the right to apply we dont dare to touch them
3655597 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3655598 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3655599 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3655600 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3655601 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
3655602 he is just a normal person although he may be from a different planet
3655603 i was just sort of trying to focus on my next race but you know i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time
3655604 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes
3655605 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3655606 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3655607 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3655608 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3655609 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3655610 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3655611 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3655612 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3655613 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3655614 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3655615 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3655616 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3655617 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3655618 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3655619 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3655620 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3655621 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3655622 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3655623 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3655624 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3655625 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3655626 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm

3655628 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3655629 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3655630 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3655631 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3655641 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but who would ever think to look for me here
3655642 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3655643 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3655644 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3655645 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3655646 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3655647 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3655648 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3655649 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3655650 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3655651 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3655652 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3655653 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3655654 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3655655 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market

3655677 chefs do not make charcuterie in france it is a full time job like making bread
3655678 i said yes no problem and then every week after that ive had a whole pig
3655679 boris gets to take what he needs for charcuterie then the wine bar and the gardiner inherit the rest we achieve this critical mass of working with whole animals which is economically viable and also feeds into a philosophy of no waste
3655680 it goes back to my own apprenticeship with a swiss expert it took me more into the world of working with whole animals
3655681 i feel weve lost touch with some of the mastery thats involved in this kind of production and boriss skills remind us of that kind of potential
3655682 at the same time it offers hope that there is a growing interest in these products
3655683 in france a lot of people know how to make charcuterie
3655684 alen on my town is the capital of boudin noir i used to make it every day
3655685 from a marketing point of view it didnt have much value on certain days and at certain times people really didnt care what they were drinking

3655688 the definition of family though expanded in some ways still very much hinges on blood or a sexual relationship
3655689 i know from my own experience as well as many of my peers that friends are just as important if not more so in providing the functions traditionally thought to have been in the family domain such as emotional support help when youre sick financial support when you need it
3655690 for instance i could designate someone to be the person who visits me in the hospital but that person could choose someone else
3655691 friendship is central to his entire idea of how to design a good city and how to design a good country and how to design good governance
3655692 friendship networks save the public money because friends can step in and serve care functions that the state might otherwise need to provide
3655693 i think friendship is one of these very core values that we cant really be flourishing human beings without
3655694 and if thats right the law at the very least can protect us when we get royally screwed

3655711 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told his daughter stella as much
3655712 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
3655713 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common
3655714 he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one daughter bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience
3655715 this is phase three of her transformation which began in 2005
3655716 shes booked in for a consultation to see if anything can be done about her arms
3655717 theres an operation you can have to remove excess skin from your armpits this can happen to women who exercise and diet too much she also wants to know if theres anything that can be done which will reduce the appearance of veins and muscles and shes even planning a boob job
3655718 i remember looking down at it and then i looked around and thought soap is overrated
3655719 the operation was the ultimate preventive measure her doctors were taking no chances that the cancer could spread to the other breast even if only one breast was initially involved in the diagnosis after the operations christina reminded herself that her mom is the classic example of a courageous cancer survivor

3655725 a product needs developers to write the code and testers to test it there are other things involved with shipping a product and the pm does those
3655726 hemos tratado todos los puntos en los que existe acuerdo entre el presidente robert mugabe y el jefe de una facci n disidente de la oposici n arthur mutambara pero existe un desacuerdo en un punto y morgan tsvangirai ha pedido un tiempo de reflexi n
3655727 hemos aplazado las negociaciones con el fin de dejar a morgan tsvangirai el tiempo de examinar estos temas

3655729 die weitgehende aufl sung der modellreserve war angemessen weil die methodischen bewertungsrisiken aus dem cdo portfolio nunmehr berschaubar sind
3655730 wir gehen davon aus dass wir die gegebenenfalls noch erforderlichen erfolgswirksamen cdo anpassungen weitestgehend bis ende 2008 bew ltigen werden
3655731 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage
3655732 they did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3655733 they looked very happy the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3655734 obviously they are world class players and we expect nothing less they stepped on the court and every open opportunity they had they executed
3655735 obviously theyre one of the hottest teams in china arguably like tennis star rafael nadal on a clay court they rarely lose in china so it will be interesting to see how they go
3655736 thats home town fans i wouldnt call it bad sportsmanship thats just how the crowd is in any country
3655737 laissez moi dig rer a et on verra apr s
3655738 two years ago the city nearly tripled the trash bill saying the money was needed to hire more police
3655739 were we foolish to believe that additional officers would be used to make our community safer by suppressing gang activity now we are told by city hall that to fight gangs we must raise taxes even after the city raised the trash bill again in august again supposedly for more police
3655740 this latest tax increase may not seem like a big deal to our highly paid city council members but to most residents struggling to pay more for gas and food and to hold onto their homes and jobs this is asking too much
3655741 their argument is not really about measure a which is finding money to keep young people from joining gangs
3655742 i think they talk about the trash fee because it is hard to argue against providing programs to keep young people from joining gangs
3655743 i think most people are willing to invest in our young people
3655744 we recognize that people who live in watts or van nuys will be paying the same as someone in bel air but it is those people who live the most with gangs and support this overwhelmingly
3655745 on a good day we can make life tough for them
3655746 we are not thinking about the uefa games the league has our full attention and the european games are just extra fixtures keflav k are right behind us in the table
3655747 it is great for icelandic football fans to get aston villa coming to iceland with their famous players and great manager so this is going to be a tremendous game the victory against kr has boosted our self confidence for the villa match and we are ready for them
3655748 i cannot say what our chances are against aston villa but we will not roll over and on a good day we can make life tough for them
3655749 often such games bring the best out of players as there is more at stake and maybe our opponents will underestimate us which can help
3655750 i dont need more ram ive got an external hard drive with 500gb of memory
3655751 yes but its a different type of memory the ram is what the pc uses to process stuff and the hard drive is what it uses to store stuff
3655752 why cant it use the memory on the external hard drive to process stuff
3655753 people are so used now to casual obscenity they dont even realise theyre hairy scrotum doing it
3655754 i can experiment with different varieties because im selling here at the market it allows me to become more varied in what i grow
3655755 no distributor would take these because they dont look perfect
3655756 the important thing id like to highlight is that these mushrooms dont grow on composted manure
3655757 you heat your oven to 350 degrees clean the mushrooms set them out in a pan in one layer and add a bit of oil you dont need to use a lot of oil just a bit with some chopped fresh garlic roast them for 10 minutes to half an hour until they crisp up
3655758 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird
3655759 no you have to ride like youll never have to breathe again at the end
3655760 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3655761 i dont need more ram ive got an external hard drive with 500gb of memory
3655762 yes but its a different type of memory the ram is what the pc uses to process stuff and the hard drive is what it uses to store stuff
3655763 why cant it use the memory on the external hard drive to process stuff
3655764 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3655765 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
3655766 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3655767 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3655768 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3655769 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3655770 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues
3655771 well i dont comment on any of that i just do my job
3655772 im sure in the not too distant future he will tell australians what he intends to do
3655773 i dont think anybody should underestimate how politically difficult it is going to be in the united states to pass legislation for an emissions trading scheme if there is not commitment and action coming from the other major emitters throughout the world
3655774 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3655775 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3655776 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3655777 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3655778 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3655779 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3655780 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3655781 we still see a big addressable market in the us
3655782 we are aiming for late adopters or those who have yet to outsource there are companies in the us who want to outsource but are not yet catered to by indian companies
3655783 while it budgets are flat offshoring becomes a more prominent part of their business strategy
3655784 smaller companies are realizing that they need to outsource in order to become more competitive as even companies overseas are becoming global and setting up in the us
3655785 aquele que utiliza os espa os de divers o nocturna
3655786 postura agressiva e provocat ria sobre toda e qualquer contrariedade que atravesse o seus objectivos
3655787 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou
3655788 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3655789 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3655790 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3655791 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3655792 a beautiful finish a tiny bit of sweetness and a good measure of salt
3655793 chefs do not make charcuterie in france it is a full time job like making bread
3655794 i said yes no problem and then every week after that ive had a whole pig
3655795 boris gets to take what he needs for charcuterie then the wine bar and the gardiner inherit the rest we achieve this critical mass of working with whole animals which is economically viable and also feeds into a philosophy of no waste
3655796 it goes back to my own apprenticeship with a swiss expert it took me more into the world of working with whole animals
3655797 i feel weve lost touch with some of the mastery thats involved in this kind of production and boriss skills remind us of that kind of potential
3655798 at the same time it offers hope that there is a growing interest in these products
3655799 in france a lot of people know how to make charcuterie
3655800 alen on my town is the capital of boudin noir i used to make it every day
3655801 this is a hamburger grill ive modified into a giant frying pan
3655802 i can cook like this in the middle of a field
3655803 seven days a week for seven months of the year
3655804 first i put the fish in the oil skin side up so the moisture goes into the skin not into the air and cook it for 8 to 10 minutes
3655805 i know the oil is hot enough when it bubbles up around the fish that seals and cooks it
3655806 if the fork goes through the fish nice and easy its cooked
3655807 you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear
3655808 good news takes months to get around bad news takes seconds
3655809 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3655810 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective

3655814 this case what theyve done is put out a directive to put some strengthening in place that would prevent cracking of the airframe
3655815 at the moment it appears that it affects six aircraft that have been checked we believe overnight and certainly some problems have been picked up where parts have been missing
3655816 its true that one step in a very complex procedure that qantas needed to do on the 737s does appear to have been missed but the procedure was there for the ongoing operational soundness of the aircraft it wasnt about immediate safety
3655817 qantas and importantly the safety regulators are on top of that
3655818 we have to make sure that safety is the number one priority when it comes to aviation
3655819 prince charles is quickly making his position as heir to the throne untenable with his meddling in politics as a future monarch he must be silent on political issues to take sides in any political debate would cause a constitutional crisis
3655820 thats the deal with the monarchy he gets to wear the crown and live off the state but he has to keep his opinions to himself it may not be fair but thats the way it is
3655821 of course charles should be free to speak his mind but he cant also expect to be an unaccountable unelected head of state its time to decide charles do you want to be a prince or politician
3655822 being married is one thing but putting the total responsibility to look after me is another
3655823 i dont believe in that i want to give my daughter a home i want to give her a house
3655824 its not that they dont want to give it to me its that they cant
3655825 she helps me cook all my personal care getting up going to bed and showering
3655826 youre sleeping in the spare room tonight that body is not sleeping in the same bed as me
3655827 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3655828 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3655829 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3655830 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3655831 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3655832 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3655833 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3655834 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3655835 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3655836 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3655837 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3655838 i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3655839 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion
3655840 who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and who do not believe in legislating from the bench
3655841 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion
3655842 he needs social conservatives to rally to his cause they are the bulwark of the party but he has to attract the middle
3655843 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3655844 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3655845 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3655846 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3655847 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3655848 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3655849 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3655850 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3655851 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3655852 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3655853 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3655854 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3655855 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3655856 who will be the next president of the united states
3655857 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3655858 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3655859 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3655860 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3655861 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3655862 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3655863 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3655864 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3655865 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3655866 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3655867 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3655868 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3655869 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3655870 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3655871 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3655872 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city
3655873 tickets for the reception where clooney will speak are going for 1 000 followed by a dinner at the home of nfc member charles adams for 10 000 a plate space for the dinner is limited to 75 guests
3655874 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras
3655875 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3655876 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3655877 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3655878 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3655879 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3655880 la dimensione internazionale del conflitto separatista tra russia e cecenia nel contesto

3655883 scientists have created two new types of materials that can bend light the wrong way creating the first step toward an invisibility cloaking device
3655884 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3655885 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3655886 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3655887 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3655888 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3655889 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3655890 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3655891 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3655892 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3655900 what keeps re running in my mind is the sound
3655901 every time an impact took place it just sounded like it was going through your whole body those explosions were so powerful that it felt like the whole earth was shattering like it was totally being blown to oblivion
3655902 she said oh my god theres a gas line leak
3655903 she ran into nicoles room got her purse got her belongings and ran by me again she dropped nicoles suction machine into my hands and said this is dangerous i gotta get out of here i dont want to die
3655904 then i heard the front door close i heard her car start and her really peddle it out like squealing the tires backwards and she split
3655905 it felt like the heat was an inch away from my face
3655906 there were more blasts here i am blind and believing every home on the street is exploding one by one
3655907 being here right in the warzone i tell you man i can understand the nurse being afraid for her life
3655908 but you know what so was everybody else you cant just leave a child
3655909 if a nurse is tending to a client they have duty of care
3655910 the normal expectation would not be that they would abandon the client
3655911 and this is the only incident or occurrence that i have heard of related to sunday that doesnt mean its okay but i wanted to give you that bit of context

3655918 we wanted to have the rally in california because its a wonderful place
3655919 it was such a great experience that we wanted to have one here
3655920 because the first rally was on the east coast i decided to hold the second on the west coast
3655921 its really really rare to have a gathering of cars where so many came from europe
3655922 part of the attraction is driving with cars from the 30s 40s and 50s
3655923 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far

3655931 the task force appears to be fully satisfied with the security arrangements being carried out for the champions trophy
3655932 i dont think it is going to happen even if they say yes now i dont think we have enough time to prepare for the series and complete the logistical details for the series

3655943 the youth are vulnerable people who can easily be coerced into subversive acts we have heard of the youth being incorporated into rebel groups but as government we are putting up strategies that will keep the youth busy all the time

3655945 the sound of helms precise yet bluesy steel guitar on williams recordings helped usher in a honky tonk sound that would define country music for years to come

3655947 i would be very surprised if there was anything like that in sedanos history because the judges are very very careful about that sort of thing

3655951 its one of the most important musicals of its era tells us more about the cynicism of urban america in the 1970s than all the sociological tracts ever written it is a work of considerable wisdom
3655952 its so critical because its not only a housing need but it also helps serve as traffic mitigation to the extent that we can provide housing close to the jobs
3655953 as they approached they saw these guys and identified themselves as law enforcement
3655954 then one of the suspects who was holding a long gun turned toward the deputies as he turned he began to raise up his arm with the gun and two of the deputies opened fire
3655955 gps is great at observing motions that a person cannot feel
3655956 it is similar to the gps in a car or that a hiker would use it gives a position
3655957 the stations pump out coordinates all day long every 15 seconds
3655958 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3655959 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3655960 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3655961 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3655962 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3655963 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3655964 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3655965 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3655966 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3655967 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3655968 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3655969 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3655970 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3655971 twelve people were killed including nine lebanese soldiers and a child
3655972 the parole conditions were similar to the good behaviour bond which she cannot sign
3655973 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3655974 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3655975 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3655976 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3655977 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues
3655978 well i dont comment on any of that i just do my job
3655979 im sure in the not too distant future he will tell australians what he intends to do
3655980 i dont think anybody should underestimate how politically difficult it is going to be in the united states to pass legislation for an emissions trading scheme if there is not commitment and action coming from the other major emitters throughout the world
3655981 one of the key messages that from those that ive spoken to in both europe but particularly the united states is that we cannot afford to basically transfer money from low income american or australian households into the pockets of already wealthy people who are running utilities in other countries
3655982 we get a lot of community support which is wonderful because there are so many groups out there trying to raise money we started off saying we need 300 recipes and then we had over 400
3655983 hospice is trying to get out in the community and educate and prepare people to get their lives together ahead of time the work they do isnt just for the dying its for the living too through grief support programs
3655984 dying is something everyone can relate to if they have had it in their family or not its something that touches everyone
3655985 so many people use hospice more and more everyday they are trying to get out the word and i think people are becoming more aware that its for the living also
3655986 friends of hospice is incredibly important to us not only as fundraisers in the community but as ambassadors
3655987 i feel really strongly that they need to pull in information from all the different groups to do the evaluation
3655988 get a complete picture of how she runs the district
3655989 its incredibly upsetting many of these staff have worked for us for many years
3655990 it is extremely hard on those who lost their job
3655991 the problem is we have a very strong program but it cant carry the weight of everything else
3655992 its very hard to make enough to cover overhead were not looking to make a profit but we have to be able to cover payroll
3655993 this shifts the whole focus of teaching youre not just grading kids against other kids
3655994 this makes it equal for kids they wont be compared to others
3655995 we can see if theres any heart murmurs or irregularities monitor the student for a day and then recommend that they see a doctor
3655996 for the longest time now health conditions have been going in a negative direction and we have to change something
3655997 we want to educate kids for the future so theyre more informed this new type of physical education encompasses connecting the body and the mind as one
3655998 i think you all know there are two very vibrant neighborhoods on either side of this plan filled with quiet calm residents who are also taxpayers and voters
3655999 we all feel this is going to adversely affect our quality of life
3656000 i hope this issue can be resolved not in 10 or 15 years but hopefully now
3656001 im glad to see the excitement at the beginning of this process and i urge you to let the process continue
3656002 we are definitely going to be digging our heels in with a big no

3656017 geraldton and other mid west towns could be vulnerable to uranium ore being transported from deposits such as yeelirie
3656018 there are significant uranium deposits in wa i would hope that we would see a mine developed
3656019 its probably at least five years away and it would be exported out of a port
3656020 the countries that do use nuclear power have the responsibility for storing safely the waste from the nuclear power generation process
3656021 people need to know that with more than 20 million packages of radioactive materials being transported every year there has never been a recorded accident in which a container has been breached or leaked
3656022 uranium is a unique mineral unlike any other and when mined poses specific and profound risks
3656023 uranium mining in australia carries serious continuing and unresolved problems and fails to meet key environmental sustainability criteria

3656034 our biggest issue is definitely going to be the fire station rebuilding or retrofitting
3656035 its going to be an issue over how to pay for it we need to get the community together and come up with a group answer
3656036 its time to get some sense back into the department
3656037 measure s was financially irresponsible retrofitting is more in the best interest of the department
3656038 no one would disagree that the station needs to be retrofitted but theres gotta be other financing options out there
3656039 i want whats best for the department as long as its economically feasible for the community

3656049 there are 11 mobile homes on the property full of junk trash and debris
3656050 the houses are full to the ceilings they are clearly hoarders but theyre also raising and breeding rabbits and dogs i dont know if theyre selling
3656051 jail is inappropriate for these folks but to go untreated is not the answer either
3656052 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3656053 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3656054 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3656055 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3656056 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3656057 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3656058 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3656059 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3656060 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3656061 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3656062 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3656063 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3656064 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3656065 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3656066 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak

3656071 during a scuffle that broke out a shot was fired and he fell to the ground and received a single gunshot to the back of the head
3656072 he is extremely lucky the bullet has gone in just behind the left ear the fragment is still there
3656073 he is a very lucky man and it is beyond belief that he drove himself to hospital
3656074 i dont know anything about what happened i dont know was he shot
3656075 if he was shot it is not unusual for this area
3656076 we have no indication of any motive we dont have a description because the victim was attacked from behind and he has not been able to say much
3656077 we are hoping to speak to him again we have spoken to the woman and investigations are continuing
3656078 we are hoping there are witnesses that have heard or seen something at around 9 30pm in the area

3656082 the police car was on a routine patrol it hit a roadside bomb in which five policemen were martyred and four others were wounded
3656083 now that this issue has been resolved i look forward to moving this case forward
3656084 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court
3656085 while we respect the courts decision we continue to believe that lane liroff and his office has a conflict of interest such they cannot be fair and evenhanded in their treatment of deshawn campbell because they continue to unconstitutionally seek the death penalty against a man who is mentally retarded
3656086 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3656087 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3656088 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3656089 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court
3656090 under the new law the media couldnt have identified him and he might still be at large
3656091 typical of a pattern that has become apparent at railcorp where employees and contractors ignore their responsibilities and the trust placed in them to indulge in corrupt schemes that cost the nsw taxpayer millions of us dollars and could potentially put lives at risk
3656092 there is no place in california where frogs are still thriving
3656093 slaten knew that duncan was unaware that he would be on air at the time that duncan answered the second call to him
3656094 im not going on the air with you because youre a nasty man and i dont like you
3656095 im speaking as a litigant and not a lawyer hes making findings that are utterly without merit and without testimony to back them up that could prejudice our breach of contract case slaten said
3656096 he wasnt paying attention during this hearing and he clearly has a dislike for me personally because you couldnt have come to those conclusions that are so utterly baseless without having a dislike for me
3656097 a complete fabrication kfns did the right thing when they fired slaten and is vindicated by the ruling

3656109 jason un eroe fallito essendo disoccupato ha molto tempo a disposizione per riflettere sui suoi fallimenti che cerca di compensare rendendo la sua vita meno noiosa con una serie di hobby molto dubbi alcuni anche da pervertito come ha visto nel libro jenni senzaltro una brava ragazza di buona famiglia ma ha altre aspirazioni vuole fuggire dal contesto della citt di provincia in cui vive ecco cosa hanno in comune i due protagonisti desiderio di evasione voglia di valicare confini ed esplorare sia metaforicamente che fisicamente mondi sconosciuti per questo si innamorano anche se non dovrei dirlo vero altrimenti il libro chi lo legge

3656111 by this time the victim had fallen to the ground so you then took his jerry can and struck him on the head or face with it some four or five times
3656112 it is apparent that the attack upon him was not motivated by some purpose such as retaliation or theft and in one sense it is much worse for that
3656113 it has been submitted and i accept that in a sad way it has taken an event of this magnitude to perhaps bring you to your senses
3656114 sono un deputato e faccio quello che c mi pare
3656115 in the tent or not in the tent for health reform
3656116 it will be the biggest indicator of whether our preference for working in the partnership with the states has been successful or not
3656117 those agreements will have accountability measures and they have never been in place previously
3656118 they are just as enthusiastic as us they of course want more resources to go with it
3656119 the new health care agreement is the first step in our long term program for health reform
3656120 there are a range of other areas which could be fertile ground for this sort of approach
3656121 we could reward states which successfully implement innovative programs to reduce tobacco use
3656122 other areas where this sort of approach could be applied include obesity aiming to reduce the proportion of australian children at unhealthy body weight by a certain per cent within a certain timeframe
3656123 but these numbers are estimates and we dont know where the problem is worst which makes it almost impossible to address because data simply isnt collected
3656124 at the end of the day youve got to look after your own backyard
3656125 athletes do it to provide their families with their best interests

3656127 but he has his reasons and everyones got their opinion on it but im not saying too much more
3656128 the boys may not talk about it but its always in the back of our mind what if what if that happens what if this happens
3656129 i enjoyed it as a kid playing it through high school but trying to crack the elite level of union is another story
3656130 whether id get bored at club level before i even put a test jumper on thats even if i get a chance to do it
3656131 theres always those possibilities of getting bored at the club level and not enjoying it not playing your best footy it could be a long road
3656132 im not saying its not the case but its that indicated to me that thats a possibility
3656133 im very much expecting locky to be with us next year and well talk about even beyond that if theres any possibility probably in the next off season
3656134 she probably was just upset and didnt want to sit home by herself and deal with it
3656135 maybe she was out for a walk or out for dinner
3656136 i think i did what anyone in a similar situation would have done
3656137 i really would like to meet that librarian to say thank you

3656142 we got a good knockdown on the fire were trying to evacuate the smoke now
3656143 she and co star juliette lewis saw me skate at a tournament in los angeles
3656144 it was so cool that she recognized me as a skater
3656145 were skating on the track alongside the actresses the neat thing is we get to keep our skate names were in the movie as dot and jackie
3656146 were skating on the track alongside the actresses the neat thing is we get to keep our skate names were in the movie as dot and jackie
3656147 sometimes i get a call the night before they want me on the set
3656148 its the best summer job ive ever had id pay to be able to do this a lot of girls would give their left knee to be a part of this
3656149 im grateful to still be hanging on to my job
3656150 theyve done a lot of hard work and research and have been training as much as if not more than a real skater they want to accurately represent the athleticism of our sport
3656151 financially newcastle united was in a difficult positon because i really do think that it had over extended itself
3656152 we first heard about the potential sale on a saturday and had the deal done by the wednesday so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying then the answer has to be no
3656153 one of the most unfortunate things about newcastle uniteds finances at that time was the amount of money still owed on players signed in comparison to the amount of income that was due in off players who had gone
3656154 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers that were done before i came so probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way it had also already taken upfront payments from commerical deals and sponsorships which didnt help us at all it seemed as though the club was in a very downward sprial one it would have found very hard to come out of
3656155 there has been tit for tat between south ossetia and georgia if theres any evidence of war crimes then the russians must produce it because theyre using the argument to justify what theyve done
3656156 and weve got to say very clearly if theres war crimes of course we take that very very seriously indeed
3656157 i think at the moment people are talking more about the organization for security and cooperation in europe
3656158 i think it would be quite wrong to rule that out i think the un is going to have an important role to play and the osce
3656159 there needs to an internationalisation of this settlement process and then there needs to be proper engagement on the ground to make sure that the rights of georgia and others are not flouted
3656160 ing has outperformed peers in recent months as it has shown to be fairly resilient to the subprime crisis

3656162 british energy remains uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build
3656163 we have always been looking at hyland but there are complications with the work permit situation
3656164 at the moment he fails to satisfy the criteria he has played in friendly matches but they have to be competitive so do not count
3656165 its a shame because he is very much one for the future and a player we are interested in
3656166 we are not even sure when we will find out the outcome its a case of how long is a piece of string
3656167 the powers that be are still working towards the permit so we will just have to wait and see
3656168 we asked what any deal would cost and then we tried to be creative with it youve got to be creative once the figures are out of your reach
3656169 we are so blessed to be able to provide this service for our children
3656170 there are a huge number of kids diagnosed with autism and that number will only get bigger were just trying to pave the road for them so theyll have successful lives
3656171 you must have eaten something wrong when you were pregnant
3656172 i think weve really changed the mindset of the chinese community
3656173 theyre more open to come out and stop being closet families with special needs children
3656174 well pick it up for free and you dont even have to be home
3656175 a session of high flying swinging occasionally with a jump into the air off the swing for good measure
3656176 ikeas findings are very revealing and never forget absolutely every square inch of your home costs you money
3656177 get rid of clutter by using smart storage systems and making better use of space
3656178 whatever you choose focus on making every room in the house work for you
3656179 not only are we exercising strict operational and financial discipline but we are also executing on a successful growth strategy that is bolstering our position in attractive markets
3656180 overall this is a solid quarter in terms of net income and the balance sheet was well protected
3656181 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan
3656182 i think this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3656183 sheikh azizs death is big loss to the kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
3656184 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this
3656185 for children who are disappointed with their results it can be extremely difficult to cope with but the most important thing is not to turn the situation into a catastrophe
3656186 your son or daughter will need emotional comfort and support but also practical help and advice
3656187 you will need to sit down with them and look at the situation before deciding on the next steps
3656188 it is so important to help the young person to keep a sense of perspective and not to dwell on the negative
3656189 they need time to assimilate the result and parents need to give them time to express their feelings in whatever way they need to
3656190 often contacting their friends can be comforting especially when they find many others have similar grades
3656191 it is also important to remember that children will absorb attitudes from their parents when there is a supportive and positive atmosphere children are more likely to cope much better
3656192 sometimes in the midst of the hype around exam results young peoples own ambitions and wishes can get sidelined or forgotten about
3656193 as parents we need to be careful not to assume that children with ability and academic achievements will necessarily want to pursue university careers
3656194 it is great if they have that choice but we need to listen to and respect our childrens aspirations

3656199 the parole conditions were similar to the good behaviour bond which she cannot sign
3656200 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3656201 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3656202 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3656203 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3656204 under the new law the media couldnt have identified him and he might still be at large
3656205 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3656206 i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy no matter who it is and thats what i will do

3656208 we found that within a couple weeks after the fire there was no significant impact
3656209 while some smoke and ash did come into the lake it didnt seem to affect the lake all that much
3656210 were worried about intense rainstorms either in the fall or spring where you have very hard rain falling on bare earth
3656211 this first year was a critical year now the patient is out of the icu but hes not ready to go home yet
3656212 what science has told us is that everything that we do can affect negatively or positively lake clarity since we are primarily a tourism community this is a huge economic issue for us
3656213 we were very worried it was a great relief to hear that the lake had not sustained the damage we had feared
3656214 obviously it will take some more money 3 1 billion is the price of the fully loaded christmas tree
3656215 were supposed to have 100 percent of kids take algebra in eighth grade and be proficient
3656216 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support
3656217 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
3656218 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
3656219 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3656220 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3656221 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3656222 it is a stronger more comfortable safe haven than it was for them a year ago
3656223 it reflects the health system not being welcoming to our culture
3656224 thats the real gap i think were facing the ability to provide a medical home for a spectrum of this population
3656225 that its not only financial reasons that are keeping latinos from the doctors
3656226 having a health care system thats comfortable and accepting for the hispanic population is much more than language

3656231 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3656232 you are a backwater to an english government and would be a jewel to an all ireland government if the 6 counties pushed they could make their best deal now
3656233 and so hms government generously grants another crum sic to the loyal subjects of northern ireland
3656234 the end of nio is good people of n ireland intermingling into mixed politics and religion with mixed schools and regions and voting for new parties created along the way sounds more civil these six counties could be an independent paradise simply named ulster
3656235 this is excellent news more powers for the n ireland government to come
3656236 have more to do with labour party internal politics than any consideration of what is best for northern ireland
3656237 ive no doubt that shaun woodward is eager for promotion and would happily see the job of secretary of state abolished but we are equally sure that northern ireland needs to be properly represented around the cabinet table
3656238 the northern ireland executive has not met in ages and the political institutions are still weak so to suggest abolishing the cabinet position of secretary of state for northern ireland is extremely foolish
3656239 the institutions need further refinement and it is important that there is a senior cabinet figure to oversee those developments
3656240 mr patterson has also maintained that given the close links with the irish republic and the interest in northern ireland in the us it is important that the position of secretary of state for northern ireland is retained
3656241 many would argue that northern ireland has suffered in the past from not being at the heart of uk politics and as a party we are determined to ensure that no longer happens
3656242 i dont think they have got another level to go to
3656243 theyve had a lot of players in their team who have hit the peak of their form in the last two years rios been awesome ronaldos been unbelievable i dont think well ever see that again rooney tevez giggs at his age theyve all been fantastic
3656244 we almost won the carling cup almost won the premiership almost won the champions league we were very close but at the end of the day werent good enough
3656245 i never actually realised how good deco was i played against him four or five times but hes probably one of the best ive ever played against and trained with
3656246 i think its unfair to pick one person or one club out because weve all committed it
3656247 i could show you 100 videos of different players and different clubs committing offences weve seen the way we want to go to stop the surrounding of the referees there are now rules last year was there or wasnt there a rule where you couldnt surround the referee i couldnt tell you now theres a rule you cant its the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee
3656248 from now on well change the menu to say per person are you happy now

3656256 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3656257 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3656258 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3656259 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of

3656268 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3656269 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight

3656275 according to directive 1 of 2006 on the procedure relating to the change of certain services provided by the universal services provider under the postal services act maltapost can apply for a number of shut down days during the year
3656276 a number of conditions are attached to the approval of the days on which maltapost will not operate such conditions include
3656277 1 maltapost is still obliged to achieve the delivery targets established in the mcas decision on the postal universal service providers quality of service requirements
3656278 2 the shutdown on friday 26th december 2008 will be subject to there being no backlog of christmas mail

3656295 hopefully friday night i can be a bit of an inspiration to people and gee whatever it takes to get them up and winning im willing to do
3656296 the thing that occurred to me before i went out during the year was play it like it could be your last game
3656297 its been well documented that i had a lot of injuries and each game i addressed like it could be my last game and thatll be probably the main theme of it
3656298 everybodys pretty pumped up about the farewell not only just for michael we want to prove a point that were not chokers and that we can win games
3656299 coming over here and seeing the way he trained the way he played and how hard he went at the ball i just looked up to that and thought i want to be him when i grow up
3656300 i hope people are there because its going to be a very cold lonely night if im riding around in the car and its pouring with rain

3656346 hammered out with the president of russia dmitry medvedev and also the prime minister vladimir putin
3656347 what it is trying to achieve is peace in this region
3656348 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3656349 for all the people who are suffering out there this is good news
3656350 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3656351 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3656352 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3656353 i think the political motive by russia is very clear to demonstrate to the world they couldnt care less about world reaction to continue to cripple the country
3656354 you thought and acted as though you were the ceo
3656355 special mission in life which others do not understand or accept
3656356 a gross breach of trust in your position in a council finance department
3656357 hagg azzan felt genuine deep gratitude mto god almighty and glorious who had supplied him of his bounty and his support a clear victory he performed more than twenty prostration in thankful prayer the moment he heard the news ans issued his instructions for the slaughter of the bullocks he also secretly distributed more than tzenty thousand pounds to poor families whose needs he himself took care of and gave a further twnty thousand to sheikh el samman to be spent on charitable purpuses under his supervision not to mention the twenty golden guines he donated to sheikh el samman on this occasion a different feeling toyed with haggazzams heart whene he thought of souad how should he celebrate his fabulous win with her that night
3656358 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3656359 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3656360 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3656361 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court
3656362 under the new law the media couldnt have identified him and he might still be at large
3656363 the parole conditions were similar to the good behaviour bond which she cannot sign
3656364 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3656365 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3656366 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3656367 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3656368 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3656369 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3656370 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3656371 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure
3656372 what they are saying is that ignoring russias interests is going to come at a price and theyve said it in a pretty brutal way
3656373 having recovered economically and to a degree politically and militarily they are in a position to say enough is enough
3656374 talking to ordinary russians there is a real sense of national humiliation
3656375 their sense of self worth was dramatically undermined by the soviet collapse their sense of being part of a major power was stripped away
3656376 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell
3656377 the kremlins message is crystal clear dont tread on me
3656378 mollifying them only strengthens the extremists because they can say look we faced down the west and won
3656379 they begin to get the earliest forms of disability about 16 years later than do the controls
3656380 they have the same or fewer knee replacements or destroyed knees they have less musculoskeletal pain they spend less money on medical care expenses and by any metric that you use they have benefited from their lifelong exercise habit
3656381 compress the morbidity of the average life into a shorter and shorter period between when the disability comes and when one dies
3656382 this was a radical change in the way people were then thinking about it and there were no real data
3656383 the other third for the most part changed to other vigorous athletic activities and they changed for the reasons you wouldnt have thought they changed because they moved away or they lost their running partner everything but knee pain they never changed for knee pain almost never
3656384 they kept the habit of exercise although some people got bored with running and quit because they were bored
3656385 if we can deal with prevention of medical treatment through looking after ourselves better exercising vigorously eating well those sorts of factors then it makes sense that well have reduced disability and premature mortality
3656386 were all going to die some day but we want to compress that to the final days of our life if we can
3656387 i suppose the simplest one is that vigorous serious exercise regularly over a lifetime swapping off into another exercise if you have some difficulty with one of the exercises is a very very good way to go
3656388 typical of a pattern that has become apparent at railcorp where employees and contractors ignore their responsibilities and the trust placed in them to indulge in corrupt schemes that cost the nsw taxpayer millions of dollars and could potentially put lives at risk
3656389 it could be argued that those global emissions contributed to the melting ice of the endangered polar bear
3656390 these modifications would clarify that the consultations are required only when a direct causal link can be made between a proposed action and an adverse effect on a species or its habitat
3656391 the proposed regulatory changes unveiled yesterday are designed to serve one purpose only to reduce wildlife protections under the esa they have been long sought by industry and other opponents of wildlife protection
3656392 the bush administration is trying to slip them through the door at the last minute
3656393 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
3656394 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3656395 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
3656396 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues
3656397 well i dont comment on any of that i just do my job
3656398 im sure in the not too distant future he will tell australians what he intends to do
3656399 i dont think anybody should underestimate how politically difficult it is going to be in the united states to pass legislation for an emissions trading scheme if there is not commitment and action coming from the other major emitters throughout the world

3656403 what i had seen really seen were lives lived with the intensity of art rife with metaphor raw distilled
3656404 the emotions of love and friendship youd assume would be missing or rotten in these communities existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality fragmentation and betrayal
3656405 these were lives lived beyond ordinariness insisting on a personal story not exchangeable with any other
3656406 i was completely unaware of the scale of the aids epidemic in india before i took part in this project
3656407 i was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what i saw and learned when an epidemic gains a human face and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease everything changes
3656408 we simply dont like to talk about it even to impart or receive essential life saving information
3656409 none of the doctors i met had initially been trained to face the disease what they were now was shaped by it and hiv had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation a rumour a makeshift pedagogy a death
3656410 whether it is violence addiction poverty or aids these miseries seem to take place in the state an invisible corner of india that seems to have received nothing from modernity except drugs guns and draconian laws

3656419 if there was major recent looting there we would have expected to find it
3656420 tens of thousands of military boots tramping over an archaeological site is not what we want
3656421 the ongoing problem is not so much looting or military damage it is the fact that these sites have faced 30 years of neglect

3656430 hydraulic energy from small dams is interesting because of its low environmental costs but everything has its limits
3656431 we predict that there will be fewer fish as a result of the energy projects on local rivers begun around 10 years ago because the dams block the fish from swimming upriver to breed
3656432 the affected rivers which are already polluted by agro chemical runoff flow towards the park where they form the xinga river and as a result the problems will be aggravated

3656438 scotlands fishing industry is to be congratulated on its success in achieving msc certification for scottish north sea herring and its work to harvest fish in a sustainable and responsible manner
3656439 scottish seafood is among the best in the world and contributes more than gbp 400 million to our economy this new investment of over gbp 200 000 highlights the scottish governments firm commitment to scottish fisheries and to ensuring they are well managed sustainable and profitable
3656440 all fisheries depend upon well managed sustainable stocks and certification is vital to the future success of scottish fisheries and their local communities
3656441 scotland recognises the importance of sustainability and is leading the way in sustainability certification with over 50 per cent of scottish fisheries currently under full assessment for the msc certification and growing
3656442 it is clear more and more consumers are looking for a guarantee that the produce they are eating is sourced in a sustain able manner and certification schemes such as msc play a valuable role in promoting fish consumption
3656443 we are pleased that the spsg has been successful in bringing together all scottish fishermen and processors to achieve msc certification this is the first large scale fishery in the uk to comply with the exacting msc standard
3656444 this is a notable achievement for the scottish pelagic industry and underlines our commitment to sustainable fisheries

3656460 weve found that octopuses effectively have six arms and two legs it had been thought they used four tentacles for movement and the other four for feeding and manipulating objects but observations showed that they use the rearmost two to get around over rocks and the seabed
3656461 they also use these two legs to push off when they wish to swim and then other tentacles are used to propel them
3656462 we havent tried to take her out of the tank to weigh her because shed find that quite traumatic
3656463 the real surprise was the frequency with which octopuses employed their third tentacles from the front on both sides
3656464 more than half of the octopuses studied were found to display no bias at all for either right or left sided limbs the rest were split fairly evenly between those preferring the right side and those favouring the left
3656465 seventeen centuries ago a young deacon and scholar named athanasius of alexandria was inspired by the holy spirit in a time of heavy turmoil in the world and in the church athanasius fought for the true catholic faith at the great ecumenical council of nicaea and throughout his entire career
3656466 emperors hated him his enemies falsely accused him of cruelty sorcery and even murder he was exiled five times and in the face of it all he became the single most articulate voice defending the true and undiluted catholic faith which is why even today we remember him as athanasius

3656475 too much according to who if that is what the tender was about and thats what was approved i see no reason why not
3656476 if the departments employees possessed the skills there would have been no need for our companys services
3656477 in many cases they repeat the things you have done

3656494 silvas openly malicious attitude toward the media and hate inciting speech and behaviour is a gross disservice to the constitutionally guaranteed right to press freedom in sri lanka

3656497 theres no evidence that theyre working across party lines to come up with solutions and weve had indications that theyll do this

3656500 the question is whether its a comprise that will get the two thirds vote necessary for passage
3656501 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3656502 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no
3656503 even family members can disagree about how this should be administered
3656504 ive hiked for years on thousands of miles of trails and this was the first time ive ever been truly afraid
3656505 this tragedy touched and changed a whole lot of lives forever

3656509 truth is not what happened truth is what we tell people
3656510 now that this issue has been resolved i look forward to moving this case forward
3656511 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court
3656512 while we respect the courts decision we continue to believe that lane liroff and his office has a conflict of interest such they cannot be fair and evenhanded in their treatment of deshawn campbell because they continue to unconstitutionally seek the death penalty against a man who is mentally retarded
3656513 its so critical because its not only a housing need but it also helps serve as traffic mitigation to the extent that we can provide housing close to the jobs
3656514 as they approached they saw these guys and identified themselves as law enforcement
3656515 then one of the suspects who was holding a long gun turned toward the deputies as he turned he began to raise up his arm with the gun and two of the deputies opened fire

3656519 she probably was just upset and didnt want to sit home by herself and deal with it

3656521 i think i did what anyone in a similar situation would have done
3656522 i really would like to meet that librarian to say thank you
3656523 no quedar entre los ocho primeros ser a un palo
3656524 hi now that youve embraced the disco and the love nest here is the street
3656525 i saw so many inexperienced teachers mostly women who became teachers because the system pushed them that way when they couldnt achieve academic standards to enter secondary schools
3656526 teaching is my passion a profession i chose because i wanted it it frustrated me that those who couldnt advance their education became teachers they try hard and are good people but they didnt choose their profession it was their only option theyre given a couple of months training and thrown into a school the kids are dying to learn but arent being taught well and thats heartbreaking
3656527 they hit students with a stick for being late or forgetting to bring firewood i so wanted to make change i never hit one of my students in fact id reward those who were on time rather than punish those who were late
3656528 it took months for me to hold my hand out to a child in greeting and for them to realize i wasnt going to hit them if school became negative for them why would they bother to come
3656529 a male teacher attempted to explain to me that in africa thats just the way things are and you must accept that hitting is just easier given the numbers of students in each class
3656530 i think he was shocked when i said i was aware of many schools where hitting is unacceptable as a disciplinary practice i suggested it was his duty as a teacher to find an alternative to the stick needless to say he didnt expect nor appreciate my retort
3656531 i did see subtle changes in the teachers during my 10 months there in the way they taught and dealt with the kids i just hope it doesnt revert
3656532 many of these kids had never been to the town i took them shopping out to eat but wondered if showing them the outside world was a good thing
3656533 i like to think i gave them a right to choose what they wanted to do
3656534 id like to have canadian schools adopt a tanzanian school and assist however they can i taught 28 kids in ilkurot to paint something they had never done i brought 28 paintings back to my school in vancouver st johns school where the paintings will be auctioned off and then hung in the school
3656535 the masai taught me theres beauty and simplicity in their life theyre not structured which forces you to see moments and be less hung up on structure
3656536 i was torn when i left because i felt i was letting down the kids stopping the momentum i had started i now hope st johns school and other independent schools like st johns can make life better for these people
3656537 you know how concerned i was to be there at the beginning well i fell in love with ilkurot and hated to leave i learned as much from my students as i gave to them learned more than i left there
3656538 obviously it will take some more money 3 1 billion is the price of the fully loaded christmas tree
3656539 were supposed to have 100 percent of kids take algebra in eighth grade and be proficient
3656540 what is it going to take to get that kind of change its going to take a real investment in services and support
3656541 we must make the investments in our school system now in order to meet this extremely tight timetable
3656542 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative
3656543 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3656544 we got a good knockdown on the fire were trying to evacuate the smoke now
3656545 we are so blessed to be able to provide this service for our children

3656547 you must have eaten something wrong when you were pregnant

3656549 theyre more open to come out and stop being closet families with special needs children
3656550 they thought we did not have veterinary officers at the grassroots level however after investigations they found that we had a well rolled out veterinary outreach programme
3656551 there was an imbalance in trade uganda allowed kenyan poultry products into the country while kenya did not ugandan farmers had to compete with kenyan poultry products
3656552 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
3656553 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3656554 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3656555 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3656556 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america

3656563 i was a teacher then a high school principal for many years in belize i retired to the pallottine center where i direct retreats
3656564 on thursdays once a month i have a day of renewal for senior citizens i am of their generation and i have a special love for them our day begins with a continental breakfast then i give a little talk we play bingo eat a very nice lunch with white tablecloths and cloth napkins we always serve our guests nourishing food but its a special day when the seniors come here talk and connect with friends
3656565 i hear so many people put teenagers down but i say teenagers are wonderful all we need to do is listen to them to hear their stories when you are the oldest child of a large family as i am you are comfortable with younger generations
3656566 after my first teen retreat at pallottine a mother came to me and asked me to hire her daughter to help give structure to her free time soon other mothers asked and i began to work with teens in the kitchen
3656567 we make cookies at the center for our retreats i make the cookie dough during the day then my young helpers will bake the dough at night

3656580 british energy remains uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build
3656581 its important to say the russians have talked about war crimes thats a very serious issue
3656582 there has been tit for tat between south ossetia and georgia if theres any evidence of war crimes then the russians must produce it because theyre using the argument to justify what theyve done
3656583 and weve got to say very clearly if theres war crimes of course we take that very very seriously indeed
3656584 i think at the moment people are talking more about the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce
3656585 i think it would be quite wrong to rule that out i think the un is going to have an important role to play and the osce
3656586 there needs to an internationalisation of this settlement process and then there needs to be proper engagement on the ground to make sure that the rights of georgia and others are not flouted

3656592 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3656593 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3656594 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3656602 those with the honour of knowing master cpl doyle which is almost everyone in the canadian army describe him as a warrior who was larger than life
3656603 all who served with erin wanted to be beside him especially at the most dangerous times of the mission
3656604 he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3656605 he passed on all the wealth of his experience to his platoon when he spoke they listened and he never had to repeat himself twice when correcting a soldier
3656606 im personally inspired every day by all the soldiers across the battle group but there are a few across the battle group who inspire me a little more when i come across them and doyle was one of those guys
3656607 he always had some ideas about how we could improve things he always thought twice about what we were doing and how we could make it better

3656619 i know my small law office has wasted many reams of paper just because of this feature i often argue with the knee jerk microsoft haters but this issue makes me think that microsoft has made a conscious choice to cause serious damage to the environment rather than spend the corporate resources necessary to fix the problem

3656622 moneyland is a powerful compilation album of thought provoking legendary music and ifc is proud to participate in and promoting this contest giving aspiring film makers an opportunity to motivate change in our world
3656623 the problems that moneyland talks about are going to take a lot of work and creativity to solve and creating short films to go along with each of the songs is a great way to get people thinking about these issues and encourage them to get involved in creating solutions
3656624 as the proportion of spending is weighted more towards software versus labour and hardware this shows that mainframe users can focus on getting maximum benefit from platform applications rather than routine support and maintenance tasks
3656625 have less than five years to come up with a new it and network infrastructure and applications that will support the new digital services
3656626 the price of mobile data services and devices is too high for mass usage today so through 2012 carriers need to devise a better road map with new mobile digital services that require less bandwidth but offer users good value for money

3656642 twelve people were killed including nine lebanese soldiers and a child
3656643 tats chlich geht der wickel der gro koalition ren kampfh hne munter weiter
3656644 was mich daran am meisten rgert ist dass man dieses gepl nkel nun auch schon auf dem r cken der n blaulichtorganisationen austr gt und sie als politikum missbraucht
3656645 f r mich ist das eine unw rdige wahlkampfmasche die uns lediglich veranschaulicht dass der streit auf bundesebene nun auch in unser bundesland getragen wird
3656646 wir freiheitliche sind stets auf seiten der blaulichtorganisationen gestanden und wollen es daher nun auch genau wissen wir werden in den n chsten tagen einen entsprechenden antrag f r die n chste landtagssitzung einbringen und machen damit die nagelprobe wir fordern erneut eine anhebung der budgetmittel f r freiwillige hilfsorganisationen die bindung der mittel aus der feuerschutzsteuer f r diesen budgetposten eine befreiung von der umsatzsteuer beim ankauf von ger ten und fahrzeugen und eine befreiung von der akm abgabe

3656652 over the last couple of months where i havent been playing youre always looking for ways to motivate your teammates to get us back up onto the winners list
3656653 hopefully friday night i can be a bit of an inspiration to people and gee whatever it takes to get them up and winning im willing to do
3656654 the thing that occurred to me before i went out during the year was play it like it could be your last game
3656655 its been well documented that i had a lot of injuries and each game i addressed like it could be my last game and thatll be probably the main theme of it
3656656 everybodys pretty pumped up about the farewell not only just for michael we want to prove a point that were not chokers and that we can win games
3656657 coming over here and seeing the way he trained the way he played and how hard he went at the ball i just looked up to that and thought i want to be him when i grow up
3656658 i hope people are there because its going to be a very cold lonely night if im riding around in the car and its pouring with rain
3656659 but the supporters and fans have been fantastic for our club all through history and its a chance for me to say thanks to them
3656660 typical of a pattern that has become apparent at railcorp where employees and contractors ignore their responsibilities and the trust placed in them to indulge in corrupt schemes that cost the nsw taxpayer millions of us dollars and could potentially put lives at risk

3656665 in the tent or not in the tent for health reform
3656666 it will be the biggest indicator of whether our preference for working in the partnership with the states has been successful or not
3656667 those agreements will have accountability measures and they have never been in place previously
3656668 they are just as enthusiastic as us they of course want more resources to go with it
3656669 the new health care agreement is the first step in our long term program for health reform
3656670 there are a range of other areas which could be fertile ground for this sort of approach
3656671 we could reward states which successfully implement innovative programs to reduce tobacco use
3656672 other areas where this sort of approach could be applied include obesity aiming to reduce the proportion of australian children at unhealthy body weight by a certain per cent within a certain timeframe

3656675 the parole conditions were similar to the good behaviour bond which she cannot sign
3656676 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3656677 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3656678 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3656679 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3656680 at the end of the day youve got to look after your own backyard

3656685 i enjoyed it as a kid playing it through high school but trying to crack the elite level of union is another story
3656686 whether id get bored at club level before i even put a test jumper on thats even if i get a chance to do it
3656687 theres always those possibilities of getting bored at the club level and not enjoying it not playing your best footy it could be a long road
3656688 im not saying its not the case but its that indicated to me that thats a possibility
3656689 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3656690 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3656691 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3656692 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court
3656693 geraldton and other mid west towns could be vulnerable to uranium ore being transported from deposits such as yeelirie
3656694 there are significant uranium deposits in wa i would hope that we would see a mine developed
3656695 its probably at least five years away and it would be exported out of a port
3656696 the countries that do use nuclear power have the responsibility for storing safely the waste from the nuclear power generation process
3656697 people need to know that with more than 20 million packages of radioactive materials being transported every year there has never been a recorded accident in which a container has been breached or leaked
3656698 uranium is a unique mineral unlike any other and when mined poses specific and profound risks
3656699 uranium mining in australia carries serious continuing and unresolved problems and fails to meet key environmental sustainability criteria
3656700 well the trip through london and new york and washington has been to canvass political economic defence and foreign policy issues

3656711 leider wird das potenzial der stromerzeugung direkt aus der sonne ber photovoltaikzellen in sterreich nicht ausreichend erkannt
3656712 bei photovoltaik ist neben der enormen technischen entwicklung noch eine besonderheit zu beachten strom aus photovoltaikanlagen wird direkt beim konsumenten erzeugt und reduziert damit seinen strombezug aus dem netz somit ist f r photovoltaikstrom nicht der marktpreis ausschlaggebend sondern der endkundentarif bei oekostrom r derzeit 19 5 ct kwh die differenz zu den aktuellen gestehungskosten aus photovoltaikanlagen von rund 40 ct kwh wird fortw hrend geringer da einerseits die strompreise weiter steigen und gleichzeitig die erzeugung von modulen produktiver und deshalb billiger wird

3656719 i am confident that we will get gorkhaland by 2010 most leaders come forward for votes but i am not interested in being a minister
3656720 i am just a conduit for peoples aspirations the gorkhaland is meant for todays generation
3656721 he is my kid being a father i had to take him under my wing but i dont want him to join politics
3656722 he is a good singer and i want him to sing
3656723 he is sincere he does not seem to be interested in wealth or power thats why people think he can get them gorkhaland
3656724 many indians think we are migrants from nepal even though we have been living here for several generations if we have our own state this wont happen

3656732 weve been brought up with music and different cultures our whole life we were surrounded by it especially african culture
3656733 i think music is too associated with fashion instead of people listening sometimes by themselves and seeing what they actually like they listen to what they are told to i think if people listen to music by themselves they will find a whole new world of music that they like
3656734 he definitely tried to push us from age 3 or 4 we did music but its just like with any kid youre parents say you have to go to school our parents said you have to play piano
3656735 when youre trying to rock out on the piano you have to just sit there but with an accordion i can just be a punk
3656736 justin timberlake is bringing sexy back well were bringing the accordion back
3656737 when you listen to music that you dont understand what they are talking about you are listening to the music better in some ways youre not being fooled or have too much emphasis put on the associative things like lyrics that youre being told are sad or happy or whatever cause it might not be a lot of the music we listen to we dont know what its about and dont want to lyrically

3656926 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3656927 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3656928 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3656929 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3656930 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3656931 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3656932 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3656933 there is a new map in eastern europe and that new map needs to defended its not in russias interest to hanker for a soviet past its gone and its good that its gone

3656935 a reversion not just to cold war politics but to 19th century politics
3656936 the g7 has shown its willingness to work without russia
3656937 thats quite unprecedented since the start of the g8 i think that makes very clear to russia the political consequences of their actions
3656938 russia do have rights but they must be combined with responsibilities there will be political consequences if they do not uphold them
3656939 fifty russian tanks and apcs armoured personnel carriers are in gori they are not entering buildings
3656940 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3656941 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3656942 the territorial integrity of georgia is an absolutely key issue
3656943 countries need to know that their territorial integrity is absolutely secure
3656944 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3656945 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3656946 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3656947 sir madam why does christians disagree with polygamy while at bible there are many people have wife more than one ok we answer after we read discussion does effect of polygamy where the willing come from man or girl
3656948 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3656949 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3657058 mrs arroyo is playing a very dangerous game her administration is hoping that escalating the armed conflict in mindanao after an impasse in the peace process will somehow make a strong argument for federalism and charter change
3657059 critics of the administration have every reason to be wary of charter change especially since this has always been tied to maneuvers to keep mrs arroyo in power beyond 2010 there is nothing in the track record of this government which says it can be trusted with amending the constitution
3657060 it is not just a simple way forward as malacanang would like us to believe we dont even know how serious they are in their pitch for federalism it could all be an elaborate ruse to push a more sinister agenda
3657061 the ensuing armed tension from the impasse in the signing may have also been a calculated risk by the regime so that it could play the federalism via charter change card the escalation of hostilities puts pressure on congress to adopt changes in the constitution
3657062 we are faced with a very dangerous government who will not think twice about using actual armed conflict to advance self serving goals it seems that the current regime wants to stay in power no matter the cost even if it means escalating a war

3657069 my thesis is that the american people and their chances for good government are the ones most harmed by these scandals in fact i recommend that we should stop considering sexual behavior as a qualification for political office
3657070 it makes men want to have more different partners on top of the self selection of adultery prone men into politics the opportunities probably increase for a successful politician
3657071 not so oversupplied with brilliant wonderful effective politicians that we can afford to disqualify a substantial number of them based on something as irrelevant as a bit of wild oats
3657072 yes im a poultry dealer if you are not a dealer you will never surive in zimbabwe there is not a single person in this country existing on their salary alone we use our workplaces and our colleagues to conduct our deals and we hold on to our jobs in the belief that one day things will improve and we will regain our dignity

3657080 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3657081 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3657082 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3657083 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3657084 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3657085 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3657086 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3657087 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3657088 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3657089 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3657090 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3657091 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3657092 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3657093 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3657094 for some more time inflation can increase it could touch 13 per cent but by december it will start declining and is likely to moderate to 8 9 per cent by march 2009
3657095 it inflation could be brought down to 8 9 per cent by march 2009 through coordinated policy action
3657096 the tight monetary stance needs to be maintained till the pace of inflation comes down
3657097 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect indian economy as well

3657100 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3657101 for all the people who are suffering out there this is good news
3657102 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3657103 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3657104 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3657105 i think the political motive by russia is very clear to demonstrate to the world they couldnt care less about world reaction to continue to cripple the country
3657106 the objective of the trials was to assess its stability in flight as well as accuracy and consistency
3657107 there is a new map in eastern europe and that new map needs to defended its not in russias interest to hanker for a soviet past its gone and its good that its gone
3657108 the russians want to assert themselves in ex soviet space thats not acceptable these are individual sovereign countries with territorial integrity of their own
3657109 a reversion not just to cold war politics but to 19th century politics
3657110 the g7 has shown its willingness to work without russia
3657111 thats quite unprecedented since the start of the g8 i think that makes very clear to russia the political consequences of their actions
3657112 russia do have rights but they must be combined with responsibilities there will be political consequences if they do not uphold them
3657113 fifty russian tanks and apcs armoured personnel carriers are in gori they are not entering buildings
3657114 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3657115 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3657116 the territorial integrity of georgia is an absolutely key issue
3657117 countries need to know that their territorial integrity is absolutely secure

3657119 impacts of increased access to oil and natural gas resources in the lower 48 federal outer continental shelf
3657120 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
3657121 the nrdcs arguments above neatly encapsulate the position taken by environmentalists and other opponents of offshore drilling and they include a couple of good points contrary to the baldly political suggestions regarding lower gasoline prices by president bush and sen john mccain r ariz drilling would make no impact on todays pain at the pump because it would be years before any oil flowed from the outer continental shelf
3657122 hammered out with the president of russia dmitry medvedev and also the prime minister vladimir putin

3657124 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground

3657133 will the hatfields and mccoys ever be able to coexist
3657134 it is always very important to microsoft that we respect the intellectual property rights of others and we regret that this specific marketing program fell short regarding our own very high standards we are grateful to pro imaging for raising its concerns about the use of photographers works on the iconic britain web site we have since taken steps to obtain the rights to use every image to be featured in the subsequent stages of the iconic britain competition we also welcome the invitation by pro imaging to discuss with them best practices when using photographs in similar competitions
3657135 nikon uk would like to confirm that it has formally withdrawn its support from microsofts iconic britain competition this is due to the feedback and concerns raised by photographers and entrants surrounding the competition mechanic that was developed and promoted by microsoft as the camera prizes that were on offer have already been won nikon will fulfil its commitment to these winners however it will not be associated with the competition going forward

3657139 this is sickening to treat other human beings like that is simply appalling i hope action is taken to remove this sign immediately we must never see anything like this again
3657140 landlords should play a positive role in helping migrants feel welcome in the area instead of playing into the hands of racists
3657141 this despicable matter is unrepresentative of a community which is making significant progress migrants play a massively positive role in our community they bring cultural diversity to northern ireland and they contribute greatly to our economy
3657142 twelve people were killed including nine lebanese soldiers and a child
3657143 thats one cool guy sitting over there he looks extremely fit doesnt he
3657144 judging from the way hes built he probably is a commando
3657145 but i guess when people see me now they just go hey
3657146 dont you know that to liken you to one of the teletubbies would be a compliment
3657147 its so critical because its not only a housing need but it also helps serve as traffic mitigation to the extent that we can provide housing close to the jobs

3657151 these are probably the most serious charges you could level against an army officer and a father
3657152 just so the jurys clear the beating occurred the day after the emergency room visit
3657153 i think its very reasonable for somebody whos scared and feels threatened to have her dates mixed up
3657154 in light of the offense jordan has been found guilty of committing and the substantial evidence in mitigation rowe determined that an administrative reprimand was a fair and appropriate disposition of the matter
3657155 i wasnt thinking and i got a little carried away with my statement
3657156 i changed my mind because i realized the military has better things to offer me than selling drugs
3657157 so it was just a fluke that you were busted doing your last distribution
3657158 if they think shore was lying at the article 32 hearing then they probably shouldnt have relied on his testimony to add charges to corrales
3657159 i simply dont think there is any evidence of criminal conduct that would warrant an investigation
3657160 did with intent to kill shoot at and hit the detainee multiple times with an m 4 rifle
3657161 its got to be political i have no idea what they are really after
3657162 most average citizens would have cracked just under the stress of the combat tour by itself
3657163 im going to stay in the military which is the best thing
3657164 this has been a scar that will stay with you the rest of your lives
3657165 if you state you believe he should retire he will do so
3657166 im stuck in this really really annoying bad wheel chair
3657167 we just dont have the cars denver just isnt really big on chauffeurs
3657168 i am totally booked and have been for six weeks
3657169 a lot of the companies put in reservations for black suvs and apparently the secret service had all of those canceled because they needed the vehicles instead
3657170 hes a person of stature to have three rent controlled apartments is unfair hes a hypocrite there are a lot of people who really need them its not right
3657171 im having difficulty buying food hes got money this isnt fair to us why does he need them
3657172 you get someone like rangel coming out to help us while they help us they help themselves first lets keep it real they said they were going to rebuild harlem but they didnt say they were going to kick us out theyre all sellouts
3657173 it was a good job on his part if he was trying to stay away from people
3657174 it looked like he was trying to make a landing thank god no one was injured on the ground
3657175 he was a marine engine mechanic and he took the angel flights regularly
3657176 moment is coming if hall and asomugha become unavailable you all know what i think about that if you read my tuesday article
3657177 any coach is going to say that but i think were ready a lot of guys arent ready to do things in life until theyre thrown in the fire then youve either got to man up or bitch up i think were ready to man up
3657178 the last two days havent been as good as the rest of camp has been theres always those days where you have those ups and theres days where you have those downs
3657179 i think we get tested with our first unit because our defense is so talented especially the first secondary and stanford routt being the third corner thats part of it but thats no excuse we have to improve our timing consistency its going to continue to hurt us until we have all of our receivers practicing every day with our quarterback and were in good enough shape that they can do that
3657180 jamarcus went 5 for 5 and a number of those were check downs but thats what was there in that drill our linebackers play really deep in general in zone coverage so youre going to deal with a lot of check downs versus our defense and when youre in 7 on 7 youre going to deal with check downs
3657181 its going to be how they respond if we go down there and were not practicing the way we need to be if we go out in tennessee and get our butts kicked and come back and dont practice the way we need to then we can always go back to that format
3657182 how do i retreive the position in pixel of the balls
3657183 next time someone considers rewriting an app into insert currently fashionable language here
3657184 ror which is like the php of web development frameworks
3657185 ok i have an idea of how to make this app better what if it were written in
3657186 if it does that it could then go through that corridor into the boreal forest
3657187 thats essentially the bridgehead the connection for a ground based spread
3657188 there are lots of things that turn trees red so at this stage of the game thankfully there have only been false alarms
3657189 the opportunity to respond in a preventative way we are certainly trying to capitalize on that luxury
3657190 we arent able to give a credible forecast with any kind of certainty about whats going to happen
3657191 it could be one simple thing that causes it it could be one log that gets here
3657192 we arent going to stop it with cultural practices i dont think
3657193 my graduates are assertive innovative and have the ability to make science based independent care decisions
3657194 we moved away from teaching a medical model memorizing diseases and treatments now we emphasize conceptual nursing so students can problem solve and think critically in any situation
3657195 nurses look at the patient holistically and manage interdisciplinary care we truly see the whole picture
3657196 i felt like i was making a difference in someones life
3657197 i worked everywhere from a locked psych unit to a labor and delivery floor in a suburban hospital
3657198 i never thought i would want to go into adult oncology
3657199 but when i found out that i could take a course in it i signed up i ended up falling in love with the field
3657200 nursing has expanded beyond the traditional roles to include forensic informatics legal and research nursing traditional roles are expanding right along with technology
3657201 through the flexibility students are able to log on and complete coursework anytime anywhere
3657202 we are committed to helping combat the shortage of nurses by providing accessible and convenient degree programs for nursing professionals
3657203 it worked well with a full time work schedule and being a husband and father of two
3657204 nothing is ever boring or the same there is always something new
3657205 there are many other areas in which you can practice the art and science such as occupational health pharmaceutical corporate health care specialist sales and research how many other career paths can lead you in so many different and exciting directions not to mention the opportunities for further education
3657206 there is significant evidence that the ancients were well aware of the great south land
3657207 it makes a lot of sense for the state to decide which services they provide and cut back that
3657208 remember the state is giving us back our own money for them to take more of it and not send it back to us would be not only bad policy because wed have to cut back services or find alternatives sources i think its sort of an outrage
3657209 by any measure these are staggering cuts that would devastate new yorks health care infrastructure and severely threaten access to care
3657210 i appreciate your concern but i really cannot say anything right now
3657211 as long as i know me and you are doing it and the other ones not gonna come out of the woodwork
3657212 i told you to forget about that forget about that
3657213 but you know thats in my head with this kid
3657214 you gotta forget about that hes gone hes forgotten about
3657215 it just hurts me that thats how they turned out
3657216 demand is going to be high especially in the first few years
3657217 the fact that its a smaller ballpark will stimulate the urgency to buy the tickets early youre going to see the secondary market such as stubhub com become more popular
3657218 i knew they were going to go up i was thinking about 10 000 for the two which would have been fine but they went out of completely control
3657219 well ive been a mets fan my whole life but i was like the yankees have won 26 world series im sure they can justify it you guys won two and had the biggest collapse of all time last season
3657220 it costs more to put gas in the car or to take the train and now it costs more to get a seat in a stadium that we paid to build
3657221 its kind of insulting to new yorkers go find the money somewhere else give us a break leave joe public alone
3657222 we dont think in those instances people were doing it intentionally
3657223 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3657224 when people feel confident with their appearance they deliver content more confidently to their audience
3657225 i had just traded in my naval officers uniform i was a lieutenant jg for my page uniform so i basically swapped one outfit for the other
3657226 and i thought the page uniform was pretty sharp we used to have an inspection every day
3657227 it was a huge sense of power you have no idea
3657228 the uniform was navy blue and we had either white red or gold braid on our shoulder it depended on whether you were a lowly page a middle of the road page or a godlike page
3657229 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3657230 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3657231 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
3657232 but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3657233 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3657234 and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3657235 we met at her home sat in her living room
3657236 she looked terrific shes absolutely rock solid from working out
3657237 but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3657238 in this instance the radar was able to pick up on traffic across livingston county along i 55 as well as iroquois county along i 57 the specs of higher returns are where the beam is being deflected back to the radar off of traffic it may be hard to make out but the green and blue specs along i 57 near danforth show some in bound velocities of 115 knots 130mph hopefully this was just noise and not someone driving too fast

3657246 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win
3657247 brilliant but out of her mind her hatred for the us is visceral she drank the kool aid shes a pakistani religious zealot who hates america
3657248 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3657249 we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3657250 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3657251 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3657252 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3657253 this is an nypd wish list and its not a security plan
3657254 based on that experience i think we have to not create another war zone
3657255 men den var av jag trodde den var h vd s ger han

3657259 while the details of the incident are still emerging we want to make it clear that unity takes this matter very seriously
3657260 the two individuals concerned have been suspended pending a full investigation we do not wish to comment further since to do so would prejudice the investigation
3657261 we expect unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations you gotta laugh at this comment by a councillor
3657262 we expect unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations im sure there are more pressing things going in oldhams council offices like higher taxes and lowering of public services 13 08 2008 at 08 10
3657263 democratic presidential candidate barack obama has proposed a plan to ease the pain of high gas prices by granting an emergency 1000 tax rebate to consumers intending to finance it with a windfall profits tax on oil companies senator obamas plan may be astute politics but it is bad economics
3657264 its definitely a massive fight ahead because the premier league is full of great players
3657265 its a massive step up from the championship but theyve earned it
3657266 why shouldnt they do it and become an establish premier league team
3657267 the mountain is high while the moon looks small the water ebbs and the rock juts forth

3657277 explore ways with russia to reduce and hopefully eliminate tactical nuclear weapons in europe
3657278 received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers on georgian territory
3657279 theres a certain uneasiness on the part of washington to move unilaterally to remove tactical nuclear weapons from europe while russia has a greater number of tactical nuclear weapons maintains there
3657280 belgian german italian and dutch pilots and ground crews are trained to handle nuclear weapons
3657281 on a day to day basis there are american personnel based at those air bases there are weapons storage bunkers that are operated by the americans and they maintain control over the nuclear weapons
3657282 remain under the control not of america but of nato and they are nato nuclear weapons
3657283 the local american commander of the nuclear weapons then hands over the control to the local air force and the local air force delivers them
3657284 russian officials have pointed to the us weapons in europe as a justification to reject limitations on russias own tactical nuclear weapons
3657285 to american plans to develop a defence shield against missiles from iran and other countries
3657286 theres some form of debate in the democratic party between those who say that they should be withdrawn unilaterally and those who say they should be used as a negotiating tool

3657325 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
3657326 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
3657327 impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
3657328 scores of us universities and biotechnology companies since 2001 have benefitted handsomely from billions of dollars in biodefense cash across the country biodefense labs are sprouting up like weeds the unrelenting spigot of federal money has thousands of scientists and technicians
3657329 sabotaged the verification protocol for the bwc and fully intend s to engage in research development and testing of illegal and criminal offensive biowarfare programs
3657330 the costliest most grandiose research scheme ever attempted with germ warfare capability going forward under president bush and in defiance of

3657343 the strongest argument we can make for him is to win the wild card
3657344 but the numbers that he put up were just ungodly
3657345 if he keeps putting up the numbers and we make this push its a good chance
3657346 of all the years including my amateur career this is the best team ive been on not as far as players and talent wise but as far as getting along with each other as team
3657347 ive been on teams with players that won mvps theres nothing like it its almost like its a team award
3657348 baseballs one of those great team sports where you feed off the people around you so it would be a great thing for the team but it would be an even better year for josh
3657349 i think alex probably hits more homers and he was playing short but from an rbi standpoint josh is obviously setting the pace in the major leagues this year so its really difficult obviously to compare one season to the next
3657350 were not thinking about catching the angels in the division or anything were thinking about that wild card spot
3657351 we know that it would catapult him to mvp status
3657352 theres a lot of emotional up and downs in that game
3657353 for me my whole goal is to just stay keyed on what my job is at hand and thats closing the door on the ballgame i saw an opportunity for the game to be over and for us to pull a win out of that crazy game and im going to do everything i can to keep that intact
3657354 it just felt like we came in and everything we threw at them they were right on top of us
3657355 most of the guys will tell you its the first time theyve been part of a game like that especially in the big leagues
3657356 thats something you might see in pacific coast league this was a crazy game obviously having papelbon at the end helped us out and even he wasnt immune
3657357 i figured wed be able to keep scoring more and more runs
3657358 when you go to the bullpen early youre always running the risk that exactly what happened can happen
3657359 okie said he thought he had to hang on to the 10 0 lead
3657360 he felt good out there his changeup is coming back as well as his curveball but it was a tough long game
3657361 i dont think we ever worried about not getting the lead back it was just a matter of trying to keep it to a minimum if you will trying to limit the damage it was one of those seesaw games
3657362 i think one of the strikeouts was a good pitch and the other one was i think it was a thing about trying to get the game to speed up but that really didnt work
3657363 luckily we got the cheers at the end when you play here for a number of years you just go out and play you go out and play for your teammates you go out and play for each other thats what we do and you want the emotions from your teammates
3657364 if we dont have the fan maybe it would have gone over
3657365 when i came back in the dugout i had three guys say it was a home run and three guys say it wasnt
3657366 i think a lot of its confidence he just has to get his confidence back its huge for him just having his confidence
3657367 weve got two more months to decided where were going to be and the end of the season
3657368 it was an exciting game we need that kind of game the way everybody kind of relaxed loosened up weve got two more months to decide where were going to be at the end of the season so thats the kind of game that puts you in the mood and gets you going all the way
3657369 even more than that was to see the last out
3657370 thats an interesting night at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal
3657371 that had a chance to be a really frustrating night and in the end the musics playing and we won thats what we set out to do thats not exactly how we drew it up
3657372 youve just got to play it out because theres no time youve just got to play the outs till you get the 27th out
3657373 i also felt the emotion of the boos today too
3657374 the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3657375 i took those two swings my last at bat the first one i felt like a little grab on my side the second one i felt something a lot more significant
3657376 the last pitch i kind of panicked i didnt know what to do i didnt think i could swing i was kind of hoping hed just flop a curveball or something ive never had this happen to me before its just frustrating
3657377 i feel like keeping bent over feels a lot more comfortable getting up out of a chair isnt the greatest thing i just hope i sleep good tonight
3657378 i hope tomorrow i feel better im just im not sure
3657379 im kind of i wouldnt say nervous about it but i feel like im in uncharted waters id like to avoid the dl
3657380 i dont see them as two totally different things its just too much of a coincidence
3657381 those two swings were weird i tried to kind of bend over and grab it and see if something would go away but i dont know its kind of getting progressively worse
3657382 i left some balls up theyre big league hitters theyre a great hitting team i left them up and they hit them well i just couldnt make an adjustment at that point
3657383 todays really his first day of baseball activities on the field now hes not going in the hole and throwing people out but hes starting to get back on the field which is good hes worked hard

3657387 its definitely a massive fight ahead because the premier league is full of great players

3657389 why shouldnt they do it and become an establish premier league team
3657390 over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bank bill rate is down around half a per cent so that significantly reduces the banks marginal cost of funding
3657391 i think that means that there is no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3657392 over time we would expect that the margin on home loans will revert to a level which was consistent to where it was say 12 13 months ago
3657393 if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3657394 additional interest rate rises on top of the reserve bank have been proven to be more about profit gouging than about a serious downturn in the banking sector
3657395 if the rba fails to deliver on rate cut expectations confidence almost certainly will collapse

3657398 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3657399 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3657400 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3657401 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3657402 we do know from focus groups and anecdotal conversations with travelers that the destination is growing in appeal
3657403 dealing with gay tourism has to be done in an intelligent and sensitive way
3657404 it is wanted its just tricky like so many things in israel
3657405 this is a delusional campaign for a minority with a normative defect
3657406 those who fail to recognize jerusalems holiness should stay away from it
3657407 like other religious countries trying to attract gay tourism like spain the government has turned over marketing to the local level or taken it underground
3657408 this is not the russia of 93 or 94 a terribly weakened russia
3657409 the russians are now negotiating from a position of strength
3657410 weve been working on georgia for four years and weve failed everyones guilty but putin is playing his cards brilliantly he knows exactly what hes doing and the consequences are all negative
3657411 this was a proxy war not about south ossetia but about moscow drawing a red line for the west
3657412 they marched into georgia to challenge the west and the west was powerless were dealing with a new russia
3657413 this property is a solid fit with the loan criteria established for our fund

3657416 is there a simple test that can be used to quickly determine an executives leadership ability

3657420 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3657421 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3657422 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3657423 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3657424 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new
3657425 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3657426 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3657427 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3657428 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities
3657429 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower
3657430 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3657431 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3657432 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3657433 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3657434 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3657435 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3657436 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3657437 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3657438 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3657441 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3657442 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3657443 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3657444 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3657445 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3657446 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3657447 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3657448 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3657449 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3657450 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3657451 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3657452 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3657453 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3657454 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3657455 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3657456 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3657457 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3657458 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3657459 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3657460 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3657461 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3657462 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3657463 who are open to doing something on the production side
3657464 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3657465 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3657466 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3657467 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3657468 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3657469 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3657470 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3657471 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3657472 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3657473 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3657474 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3657475 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3657476 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3657477 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3657478 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3657479 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3657480 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3657481 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3657482 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3657483 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3657484 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3657485 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3657486 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3657487 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3657488 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3657489 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3657490 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3657491 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3657492 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3657493 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3657494 cnn were staffing up call goes out for all platform journalists
3657495 today i went out and found a cute guy and convinced him to come home with me and seduced him into letting me suck his dick while he held the camera

3657497 entendemos las variaciones de nivel de una se al en el tiempo una cantante de pera que haga continuos crecendos y decrecendos tendr una din mica muy acusada un pitido de silbato mantenido al mismo volumen no tendr din mica alguna
3657498 bueno si estoy atento a los cambios de nivel puedo anticiparme y subir y bajar el volumen de entrada cuando se requiera
3657499 de acuerdo pero si est dejando pasar un decibelio cada vez entonces sobrepasar de todos modos el nivel de threshold
3657500 fue un buen compromiso m o pido una disculpa porque no se logr hacer todo lo que hubiera querido
3657501 primero es que hab amos comprometido a otros gobiernos a que pusieran una parte de los fondos recuerdo que fue al gobierno de espa a al gobierno de alemania y al propio gobierno de nicaragua porque don enrique iba a poner su parte pero en fin no se logr en el tiempo en que estuve en la presidencia
3657502 ni cambiamos constituci n para quedarnos en el gobierno no se termin el proyecto s mandamos gente a hacer el presupuesto s cumplimos con la parte del equipamiento del hospital
3657503 yo creo que no se ha terminado el tema yo creo que hay que seguir trabajando en l yo seguir a trabajando con voluntad creo que el gobierno del presidente calder n tambi n tiene voluntad para trabajar en eso creo que hay que buscar mecanismos porque esa catedral vale la pena es una catedral hist rica es una catedral que identifica al pueblo de nicaragua
3657504 de verdad cr eme ste es mi punto de vista este modelo el que se impulsa en venezuela y nicaragua est probado y no sirve
3657505 lo que sirve es la disciplina presupuestada lo que sirve es la promoci n econ mica lo que sirve es la m xima prioridad a la educaci n construir hospitales para la gente tener empleos y todo eso se lo merecen los nicarag enses
3657506 lo que m s importa es que cada autoridad sea electa democr ticamente sin chanchullos sin trampas tambi n importa que los ciudadanos vayan a votar porque si no se expresan en las urnas c mo se va a construir una democracia
3657507 las elecciones municipales representan la oportunidad de la renovaci n la oportunidad y la esperanza de un buen gobierno para eso el ciudadano tiene que cuidar sus elecciones tiene que participar tiene que votar para elegir a un buen gobierno tiene que exigir un buen trabajo a sus autoridades
3657508 yo creo que estados unidos debe abrir los ojos de que en am rica latina existe un campo f rtil para la democracia para el desarrollo econ mico y que se necesita mejorar mucho las relaciones con sus socios en centroam rica
3657509 lo m s importante es que los ciudadanos trabajemos mucho para consolidar la democracia
3657510 a nosotros siempre nos va a ir bien con la democracia con lo que no nos va a ir bien es con el autoritarismo ni con el totalitarismo
3657511 nicaragua en principio opera bajo lo que se supone es un sistema democr tico pero en mi visita he escuchado que hay dudas de c mo se van a presentar estas elecciones si es que los comit s vecinales que hay en las colonias y que dan frijoles cpc no son para alterar el sentido del voto si el control del padr n realmente y de la autoridad electoral realmente es aut nomo o est en manos del gobierno porque hay dudas entre la poblaci n
3657512 hay que reiterar que la pol tica de fortalecer la producci n y las exportaciones contin a porque a largo plazo es lo nico que sacar al pa s adelante pero tambi n tenemos que velar porque los precios sean adecuados a las condiciones de este pobre pueblo de nicaragua
3657513 pero igual hay normas que aplican para asegurar que el procedimiento de asignaci n sea transparente de all que los agentes econ micos tienen recursos legales en caso de que las normas establecidas no se hubiesen cumplido
3657514 quer amos dar una imagen perfecta y pensamos en lo que ser a mejor para la naci n
3657515 era una cuesti n de inter s nacional la ni a ten a que aparecer ante las c maras deb a ser expresiva
3657516 lin miaoke es excelente para todo eso pero en cuanto a la voz yang peiyi es perfecta todo el equipo estaba de acuerdo
3657517 nos dijeron que hab a un problema y que hab a que resolverlo lo resolvimos
3657518 es insultar a la verdadera cantante y a la gente que le escuch
3657519 puede que se utilizaran im genes de pies grabadas con anterioridad debido a la mala visibilidad
3657520 se hace todo por la imagen de china sin el menor respeto por el p blico
3657521 no creo que el gobierno chino se d cuenta hasta qu punto esto no es tico ni siquiera entiende los valores que difunde en estos casos
3657522 creo que hay voluntarios que animan a un equipo y a otro de la competici n para crear un buen ambiente
3657523 i dont know where bin laden is i have no idea and really dont care its not that important its not our priority

3657527 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3657528 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3657529 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3657530 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3657531 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3657532 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3657533 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3657534 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3657535 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3657536 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3657537 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3657538 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3657539 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3657540 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3657541 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3657542 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3657543 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3657544 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3657545 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3657546 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3657547 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3657548 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3657549 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3657577 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3657578 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet

3657592 the hungarian player has hold of us and we get excluded its total rubbish as far as i am concerned
3657593 the players tried their hearts out for four quarters and the ref goes and kills it for them
3657594 with this agreement druk air could operate services to bagdora and beyond particularly to bangkok and kathmandu via bagdora
3657595 if druk air is interested to use this route we have to inform the indian authority about the plan to operate from bagdogra and give them three months notice
3657596 theyll also have to do certain marketing in terms of traffic and study the feasibility of operating beyond bagdogra
3657597 we can still fly passengers from bagdora to bangkok but need to get clearance from the authority in thailand to fly passengers from bangkok to bagdogra same is true in case of nepal
3657598 we have only one airport so if there are any sort of natural calamities or disasters and if the airport becomes unusable theyll allow us to use any airport in india

3657636 actually i believe that atheism can include a moral compass independent from religion and seeing as i believe in the inherent goodness of humanity i believe that people have an innate sense of right and wrong and do not necessarily need the church to tell them which each are that is a person is moral because of their sense of right and wrong not out of fear of the repercussions of immorality not that spiritual morality is wrong its just not the only type of morality and atheist morality is not necessarily bad while i consider myself christian i have many atheist friends who wholeheartedly believe in the immorality of rape and pedophillia sp likewise there are many people who profess a believe in christs teachings who are rapists and child molesters i hope i manage to state my opinions clearly and without sounding confrontational just a in no way speaking from a religious point of view while i consider myself spiritually christian it doesnt altogether play an important role in my moral decsions
3657637 i believe in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible and in one lord jesus christ the only begotten son of god begotten of the father before all worlds god of god light of light very god of very god begotten not made being of one substance with the father by whom all things were made who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the holy spirit of the virgin mary and was made man and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate he suffered and was buried and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the father and he shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end and i believe in the holy ghost the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified who spoke by the prophets and i believe one holy catholic and apostolic church i acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and i look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come amen

3657692 off duty police officers last week forcibly removed a democratic party cameraman from a news conference where the seattle police officers guild was giving its endorsement to republican dino rossi
3657693 guild members threatened the young man with arrest and made an emergency call to 911 bringing uniformed officers to the scene cameraman kelly akers was warned about trespassing
3657694 akers was confronted by three off duty police officers and he says one or more grabbed him and pushed him out of the building once outside they continued to argue as the officers held akers in what he described as a
3657695 as akers was evicted from the office his camera recorded him saying in an increasingly loud and alarmed voice
3657696 was wir erleben ist der populistische versuch bedr ngter landespolitiker in bayern und leider auch anderswo die gesundheit ihrer b rger aufs spiel zu setzen um einer als m chtig empfundenen lobby zu diensten zu sein
3657697 weil die leute sp ren dass hier die relationen nicht stimmen hauptbetroffen sind hunderttausende b rgerinnen und b rger die in mit feinstaub hoch belasteten stadtquartieren leben und arbeiten und nicht spediteure die einer hohen finanziellen zusatzbelastung durch einen schlichten werkstattbesuch weitgehend entkommen k nnen
3657698 dieser nachweis umweltpolitischer ignoranz wird auch im ausland wahrgenommen werden
3657699 bei der hochrechnung angeblicher mautbelastungen mit faulen tricks und faschen zahlen
3657700 durch den besuch einer werkstatt und die nachr stung eines partikelfilters in die g nstigere schadstoffklasse euro iv gelangen und so der mauterh hung weitestgehend entgehen statt 60 prozent verbleiben dann gerade mal 16 prozent erh hung
3657701 der vorgang zeigt beispielhaft dass die politik grunds tzlich falsch liegt wenn sie versucht schwankenden kraftstoffpreisen hinterherzusteuern
3657702 luftreinhaltepolitik und klimaschutzpolitik zu betreiben ohne die deutschen spediteure gegen ber ausl ndischen konkurrenten zu benachteiligen weil alle zur kasse gebeten w rden
3657703 gegen eine im kern klima und gesundheitspolitisch hoch vern nftige regelung sofort aufzugeben
3657704 wir haben von den lteren immer nur geh rt was f r tolle hechte sie waren was f r tolle k mpfer wie toll der wiederaufbau war wir haben nie geh rt wie beschissen es ihnen ging wirklich nie und auch nicht die wahrheit ber das ausma der verbrechen deutschlands
3657705 und ich kann ihnen auch sagen wie ich links definiere die berzeugung an einem egalit ren gesellschaftsbild festzuhalten
3657706 ich geh re auch heute nicht zu denen die den krieg als mittel der politik sehen berhaupt nicht aber heute sehe ich eben auch was wir mit dem europ ischen sicherheitsisolationismus f r einen preis bezahlen
3657707 das sehe ich heute anders als mit 18 oder 25 und auch noch mit 35 aber es ist dennoch derselbe kopf geblieben der das denkt
3657708 es ist zeit zum umdenken ziel der zertifizierung ist es den betreibern nach eingehender analyse und auf basis umfassender messungen konkrete vorschl ge zur dauerhaften optimierung des energieeinsatzes zu machen
3657709 i can safely say that yu suzuki is in fact still a sega employee
3657710 even family members can disagree about how this should be administered
3657711 ive hiked for years on thousands of miles of trails and this was the first time ive ever been truly afraid
3657712 i would be very surprised if there was anything like that in sedanos history because the judges are very very careful about that sort of thing
3657713 to have that kind of an awful situation is a real anomaly
3657714 nothing makes you prouder than playing in an olympic stadium and seeing your flag flying on the roof i hope my country will now help younger brilliant players to build up experience so they can feel the same in london
3657715 there were some heart beating moments but i think you can only see the rainbow after the rain
3657716 all these people have probably never even seen me play but china loves womens volleyball and they have probably heard the stories from their parents also i think there are texts about me in the schools
3657717 it is wonderful for us to see all the support she is getting and it is great to see a volleyball player win so much respect
3657718 obviously eamon and i are great friends and i support him as much as he is supporting me
3657719 i am so excited to see him do so well in his race but hes still got a long way to go in this meet hes only just started
3657720 he may be human but hes from a different planet
3657721 no hes from this planet of course but hes just tremendously talented
3657722 now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it i have absolutely nothing to say im speechless
3657723 it started sinking in a little bit after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race i was just thinking wow the greatest olympian of all time
3657724 its a pretty cool thing its a pretty cool title i guess you could say its pretty neat and im definitely honored
3657725 its not over yet anything can happen in the next three events im not unbeatable no ones unbeatable everyone can be beat
3657726 i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that
3657727 when you have an olympic gold medal it stays with you for ever that never leaves your side youre always an olympic gold medalist
3657728 birthday happens every year christmas happens every year you only get to be olympic gold medalist so many times
3657729 this is almost everything ive asked for i would like to have been faster in the 200 fly but in the circumstances i think i handled myself pretty well
3657730 this is something weve been preparing for the last four years and i think all the work is starting to pay off and starting to show
3657731 but but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3657732 kevin is all for everything he wants her to have 50 50 custody he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
3657733 its wonderful the relationship is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3657734 i think thats an event i can do well in and probably who could stay up the longest
3657735 how would they score that would it be like figure skating where some of it is the opinion of the judges
3657736 precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3657737 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large
3657738 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend
3657739 we will ever miss his love wisdom humour and the familiar comfort of his voice
3657740 its so critical because its not only a housing need but it also helps serve as traffic mitigation to the extent that we can provide housing close to the jobs
3657741 even family members can disagree about how this should be administered
3657742 ive hiked for years on thousands of miles of trails and this was the first time ive ever been truly afraid
3657743 this tragedy touched and changed a whole lot of lives forever
3657744 once you make the decision to squeeze the trigger and discharge a round you cant ever take that back

3657746 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3657747 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3657748 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position
3657749 but we dont think todays decision changes the reason we went to court

3657758 the way triplexity works is radically different from the rehearsal concert model and thats a really interesting experience explains hamelin i often compare it to studio work only deferred
3657759 triplexity is all about this complementarity through our differences with a multicultural component an openness to other horizons that i like a lot says nikila and then theres this complicity between us that makes it a real pleasure to make music together

3657762 our third quarter results for revenues contracts and backlog reflect the continued weakness in most of our markets
3657763 we believe the consumers confidence in the housing market is the key to its recovery
3657764 with the passage of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which should help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming on the market and they have provided an incentive to new customers to move off the fence and become first time buyers in a market that is very much in their favor this may help to restore confidence in the market

3657807 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3657808 as a very conservative estimate we calculate that approximately one third of lung cancer coverage analysed in our research was primarily about smoking matters the period in question also saw the introduction of the workplace smoking ban and all the debate and coverage that followed

3657815 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3657816 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3657817 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3657818 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3657822 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3657823 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3657824 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3657836 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3657837 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3657838 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3657839 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another

3657842 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3657843 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3657941 we are known for humanitarian treatment so basically we are stuck usually there is some incentive some angle to play what you can do for them but it could get to that spot where we could go to pressure where we dont have a choice and we are probably getting there
3657942 goes against every grain in my body chances are you are going to get the wrong person and risk damage or killing them
3657943 can be extremely hard to eradicate even with caustic chemicals
3657944 s oap can break up anthrax spore clumps creating smaller individual particles without killing the bacteria and this could increase the risk of infection if the tiny spores become airborne around the sink
3657945 shelby predicted that there would be senate hearings as to why there was no warning if there was no indication then we had an intelligence failure shelby said
3657946 a secret experiment last year called project bacchus in which employees of the us department of defense covertly produced a kilogram of bacteria similar to anthrax it was milled to a few micrometres using machines available openly in the us

3657957 according to abc news the only licensed us manufacturer of anthrax vaccine is a company called bioport that virtually existed on paper when the pentagon handed it an exclusive 29 million contract turns out that a 22 ownership stake in bioport is held by a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral william j crowe and 32 is held by key bioport employees crowe may be remembered by some as the only senior military officer to endorse bill clinton in 1992 the ceo of bioport is a politically well connected friend fuad al hibri
3657958 bioport corp under contract to provide the vaccine for the military has been unable to ship any of its product during its three years of operation
3657959 a 1993 report by the u s congressional office of technology assessment estimated that between 130 000 and 3 million deaths could follow the aerosolized release of only 100 kg of anthrax spores upwind of the washington dc area
3657960 our factory could turn out two tons of anthrax a day in a process as reliable and efficient as producing coca cola

3657964 on wednesday 10 10 01 the five major television news companies jointly agreed to adhere to the white houses suggestion that they limit the airing of any future videotaped statements by osama bin laden it has long been the goal of the white house to put forth its official versions of events and control the flow of information
3657965 it could be somebody who just didnt like tabloids we just dont know

3657972 boca raton fla ap the fbi is investigating the possibility that the anthrax bacteria detected in two florida men is a result of terrorism or criminal action the bacteria that killed a man last week has been detected in the nose of a coworker and on a computer keyboard in the newspaper office where both men worked health officials said today
3657973 the fbi has been unable to find a source or cause the anthrax but this kind of situation points to terrorism or criminal intent because its so rare to have two people working in the same building who have inhaled anthrax bacteria
3657974 the america media inc building is headquarters for several tabloids that have published derogatory stories about osama bin laden since the sept 11 attacks
3657975 richard weisman a toxicologist and director of the poison information center at the university of miami jackson memorial hospital
3657976 stevens lived about a mile from an air strip where suspected hijacker mohamed atta rented planes said marian smith owner of the flight school

3657982 bacillus anthracis is a very large gram positive spore forming rod 1 1 5um x 4 10um the organism is readily cultivated on ordinary nutrient medium and grows best aerobically but will also multiply under anaerobic conditions
3657983 about 1 6 days after inhaling bacillus anthracis spores there would be a gradual onset of vague symptoms of illness such as fatigue fever mild discomfort in the chest and a possibly a dry cough
3657984 both dod and the fda had previously contended there was no squalene in the vaccine but more recent tests detected minute amounts
3657985 100 million lethal doses per gram of anthrax material 100 000 times deadlier than the deadliest chemical warfare agent silent invisible killer inhalational anthrax is virtually always fatal
3657986 anthrax can be successfully treated with antibiotics if treatment is begun early enough
3657987 there are enough anti anthrax antibiotics to treat 2 million people for 60 days
3657988 after serious symptoms have occurred in unvaccinated people despite intensive care treatment and antibiotics death rates still exceed 80 therefore antibiotic treatment must be started at the earliest sign of disease
3657989 almost all cases of inhalational anthrax in which treatment was begun after patients have exhibited symptoms have resulted in death regardless of post exposure treatment
3657990 officials are aggressively investigating the individuals schedule for the last few weeks and the source of the infection

3658003 its not what you expect especially when they make the claim that the 3g network is supposed to be that much faster
3658004 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3658005 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3658006 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3658007 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3658008 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3658009 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3658010 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process

3658013 not just in cuba but i think meeting foreign leaders without precondition applies generally i recall what john f kennedy once said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
3658014 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3658015 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3658016 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience

3658022 it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3658023 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3658024 the police have already investigated this whole incident very closely already and announced the results we dont think there will be any effect on the olympic games themselves
3658025 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan
3658026 i think this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3658027 sheikh azizs death is big loss to the kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
3658028 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this

3658058 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3658059 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3658060 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3658061 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3658062 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3658063 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3658064 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3658065 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3658066 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3658067 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3658068 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3658069 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3658070 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3658071 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3658072 logitech research revealed that the vast majority of people who use a notebook pc are mobile both within and outside the home
3658073 to meet the demands associated with increased mobility the v550 mouse offers a complete set of features to make it easier to use a mouse with a notebook when moving from the kitchen to the living room or from ones desk to a meeting now you wont have to choose between grabbing your mouse or a cup of coffee
3658074 what do i value most in my life what do i want to teach my children
3658075 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3658076 hammered out with the president of russia dmitry medvedev and also the prime minister vladimir putin
3658077 what it is trying to achieve is peace in this region
3658078 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3658079 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3658080 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3658081 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3658082 i think the political motive by russia is very clear to demonstrate to the world they couldnt care less about world reaction to continue to cripple the country

3658084 ik reageer even op uw bericht over de zgn relmuizen of eikelmuizen vorige week heeft mijn pa in zijn tuin een beestje gezien dat heel goed op de foto leek hij zag het slechts van de achterzijde het deed hem denken aan een eekhoorn maar de staart was plat het was misschien 20 cm lang heel ruwgeschat en eerder slank het kwam van tussen de rode klaver onder de appelbomen en liep

kaliber de borinageploeg francs borains is een gekende naam in de voetbalwereld en speelt in derde nationale het is een typische bekerploeg die vaak heel ver meegaat in de bekercompetitie en vorig

populatie van zeldzame knaagdieren in een grote stadstuin tussen de ommegangstraat en de kortrijkstraat in deinze het is echter niet zeker of ze zich nog in die specifieke tuin bevinden een paar jaar geleden waren er een reeks waarnemingen van deze muisachtige diertjes die enkel bij valavond hun gangenstelsel verlieten ze werden omschreven als kleine eekhoorns omdat ze een pluimstaart hebben het

3658118 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities

3658197 the party wants to inform all and sundry that it doesnt relish meddling into the current inner workings of the liberian senate as it pertains the saga of the senate decision to initial removal proceedings or finally suspend its pro tempore and as such the suspended chairman gayes position statement is a miss representation of the facts and represents his personal opinion and not the party

3658212 its an ordinance against excessive barking of a dog the key word there is excessive as one of the council members pointed out last night this ordinance isnt intended to put a hardship on citizens that love their animals and take care of them its to take care of the citizens who do not take care of their dogs and allow them to become a nuisance to the neighborhood
3658213 when action is taken is when a person shall be determined to have allowed his or her dog or other animal to bark or create other harsh or excessive noises after he or she has been once been put on written notice by the police
3658214 the dog or animal would have to disturb two or more members of the community not of the same household so what that says is if there are two members of the community that calls the police and complaints about excessive noise then the police will serve a written notice that they have to take action
3658215 one of the council members had me to do some research and the editorial column by mrs perry that was in your newspaper was of the opinion that maybe the police had more to do than take care of dogs
3658216 i went back and researched and discovered in the last year alone we had and this was reports filed by the police we had 316 animal calls we had that already in a small town and in lieu of having a full time animal control officer that falls under the police

3658229 since pet dandruff is a sign of flaky skin giving your pet regular baths will help wash the flakes away before they accumulate bathing your pet once a month in winter and twice a month in summer may clear up the problem for good
3658230 if youve tried shampoos regular brushing and new foods and it still looks like winter on your pets coat youre probably going to need professional help
3658231 while dandruff is usually nothing more than flaky skin in some cases it can indicate serious problems warning signs to watch for besides the flakes include scabs crusting or itching
3658232 problems with the skin can be an indication of internal disease after a month or so if there is no improvement you should take your pet to the vet
3658233 sometimes well see dandruff when animals arent getting enough fat in their diets giving your pet fish oil supplements will help improve the metabolism of fats in skin tissue some generic and supermarket brand foods do not provide the full range of vitamins and minerals your pet needs to maintain a healthy skin many pets have been taken off generic foods and put on a high quality food and the cases of dandruff have disappeared

3658256 what the document never makes clear is how to hold to deep moral and political convictions based in biblical principles without running the danger of identification with a political agenda at least to some extent
3658257 the manifesto is brave in calling for and end to culture warring that threatens to unravel the society and shut down civil conversation and deliberation but its bravery does not extend to any specific proposals about how this can be done

3658349 ive surely had a fun experience with wickes i bought furniture total 2 083 41 then i found out the salesman gave me the wrong information on the fabric so i canceled it one week later 1 11 08 i kept waiting for my refund check but it never came my local wickes couldnt be bothered checking on it for me finally i phoned the corporate office in chicago they said theyd just filed bankruptcy and to forget any refund when i asked if i could just go pick up the furniture better than losing the total amount i was told the check was frozen and no refund i feel so cheated and basically as though someone had stolen 2083 41 from me i have no recourse paid with an electronic check even though my money wont be given back wickes still has their doors open and you can go in and buy furniture but do pray you wont lose your money i cant tell you how sick i am im not a wealthy person and had to save a long time for this can you imagine buying something and never getting your money back or your merchandise its robbery
3658350 a close friend of mine referenced above recently bought some furniture from your company she changed her mind as delivery was going to take a long time and she cancelled it one week later and asked for a refund no furniture was ever even close to being delivered to her
3658351 cancellation policy you may cancel your order for a full refund anytime before the 3 days preceding your scheduled delivery
3658352 except that we wont give you the money back after all

3658354 it was just a talk about pitch selection and being able to be a little more selective especially before you get two strikes on you
3658355 i dont know that it had anything to do with what nick did tonight but youre always happy to have a talk with one of your guys and then it pays off right away that night it makes you look like you know what youre talking about
3658356 whats the mechanism we think we know but we dont know it until we block it and make sure it is
3658357 if youre obese one treatment may work but another one may not
3658358 we can identify the abnormality and in the current study we are identifying the treatment that is going to be effective for that abnormality
3658359 that treatment will probably be effective in adults and we at some point would probably look at that
3658360 well know the genotype and well know how obesity plays a role and say if youve got this genotype and youre obese or not obese then this is going to be the most effective treatment for you
3658361 its exciting to be doing something that maybe it will take five years down the line but its going to have a clinical impact
3658362 ive said that in the absence of golf in the olympics that its the major championships particularly the british and the pga that have the broadest international element
3658363 but the ioc has no precedent for them co administering an athletic competition right now the model doesnt appear to make something like that practical
3658364 but if something changed in how the ioc approached the administration of the olympics we would keep our eye on that
3658365 but there doesnt appear to be enough there that something like that is possible
3658366 by the end of september nobodys going to be paying
3658367 i picked up five new passengers yesterday that was riding and paying for the bus last week
3658368 and the taxpayers of richmond county are having to foot the bill
3658369 from what we get out of the bus route and what theyre paying ive actually suggested we make it free
3658370 im looking at a 3 1 million deficit ive got bigger problems
3658371 transit only pays 800 000 of a 5 million deficit a year
3658372 the rest is coming out of the pocket of the taxpayer
3658373 when we dont have the state dollars that we need we must reach into our reserves
3658374 our reserves are dedication commitment loyalty and hard work our reserves are in our people they are in you they are in all of us and we need every one of you
3658375 no one knows how all of this is going to work out but i think it is best to assume that our state allocations will be cut by well over 2 million
3658376 and i want you to understand one other thing which is that layoffs a term you may have heard used elsewhere is the absolute last option that we would ever consider in dealing with budget cuts
3658377 if you want to see the rainbow you gotta put up with the rain
3658378 this is a heck of a place so much talent so much dedication and commitment so much hard work so much smart work so much value added to the lives of our students our community and our world
3658379 what we did last year means a stronger foundation for what we will do this year weve set a strong foundation for the future every year and weve done so with very modest resources
3658380 maybe that is a priority but thats something that can be delayed
3658381 i dont think its time to panic and go into special session
3658382 theyre cuts nobody wants to be but they are cuts they think they can handle
3658383 rising fuel prices and the need of fleet operators to drive costs down and to increase efficiencies created a favourable operating environment for fleet management technology
3658384 del ponte would say we need a few muslims as well as serbs but the muslims generally didnt try to commit genocide or ethnic cleansing so the cases brought against them tended to collapse
3658385 nobody who is a serious student of sudanese politics takes seriously the idea that bashir used the whole state apparatus
3658386 this is better than the sanitation pads women buy in the shops because you reuse it over and again
3658387 moreover it does not clog the toilet as the commercial ones do
3658388 can you imagine the excitement when women discover the beauty of our products we are going to make serious money
3658389 moreover we need to know what we are going to say
3658390 the whole approach was wrong because we were waiting for the women to come to us young women who no longer believed in themselves and for whom it was impractical to take the smallest step toward self help
3658391 once we realised that some of the women could barely read and that we were shooting too high we came down a notch by introducing real life experiences which enabled them to earn money on the spot
3658392 we have baked for 500 people for weddings birthdays for celebrations in far away places including kampala jinja and other parts of uganda the sky is the limit and we are just getting started

3658399 recanalizar esta arteria en principio no tenemos la certeza absoluta porque el co gulo es grande y hay ciertos l mites en los cuales podemos actuar y hay otros en los que tenemos que desistir de recanalizar la arteria para pasar a un segundo procedimiento que es la neuroprotecci n la cual consiste en tratar de bajar el metabolismo del cerebro que no requiera muchos nutrientes

3658528 encik fadzli saya ada satu soalan untuk menghangatkan lagi suasana perbincangan kita
3658529 mengapa dalam permainan bola sepak seperti yang dianjurkan kami semalam setiap peserta berusaha bersama sama dan bersungguh sungguh untuk mendapatkan kemenangan tetapi apabila pulang ke pejabat sahaja semangat kerjasama tersebut hilang macam itu sahaja
3658530 ok satu soalan yang bagus ada sesiapa ingin berkongsi pandangan tentang perkara ini
3658531 pada pendapat saya dalam permainan bola sepak setiap orang mahukan kumpulannya menang tidak kisah siapa yang menjaringkan gol mereka tetap akan mendapat kemenangan tersebut
3658532 mungkin saya boleh huraikan sedikit lagi pendapat kawan tadi dalam permainan bola kita berkongsi matlamat yang sama jika kumpulan kita yang menang maka
3658533 tapi apabila masuk dalam konteks bekerja di pejabat kita tidak nampak reward yang akan dikongsi bersama jika jualan rumah meningkat maka unit bahagian jualan sahajalah yang mendapat untung tetapi kami di unit unit lain yang turut bekerja hanya menerima gaji bulanan macam biasa seolah olah kami ini tidak menyumbang apa apa dalam kejayaan tersebut
3658534 ah kalau aku buat kerja dia yang kena puji dia juga yang dinaikkan pangkat

3658544 she has a good top good middle and good lower voice but who cares
3658545 it may not always be exactly clear which note jones is singing at any one time but what a generous artist to give us the choice at such resplendent volume

3658565 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than originally thought

3658620 jesse do you feel that we dont care enough about you
3658621 no father its just that that its so hard to talk to you about some of my problems sometimes
3658622 jesse i have an idea but are you willing to let me help you

3658624 thats a good idea dad im willing to try it out but can i bring haniella with me
3658625 sure why not i dont see any harm of you bring her too
3658626 haniella im home i have some news for you i called out
3658627 what news jesse and please dont shout youre going to wake up the girls
3658628 it says here that a myth about heroine is that after one dose of it you get addicted by it
3658629 thats not true being young it takes awhile before getting addicted to heroine the quickest about 2 3 months but usually longer true that some drugs are easier to get addicted that some others but for heroine you dont get addicted to it after one dose of it what else is on there
3658630 it says heroine can give you spots and can make you thin
3658631 my goodness what false truth lies there heroine doesnt give you spots or make you thin
3658632 yea it is anyway tell me how your day was
3658633 hey dude long time no see come on relax and have some heroine
3658634 hey dude long time no see come on relax and have some heroine
3658635 surely this is somewhat disproportionate overkill or is this a case of financial considerations prevailing over equity and justice
3658636 the heavy truck belching out plumes of thick black diesel smoke dropping oil onto the road surface and carrying a load of uncovered building material that is sandblasting other road users windscreens is not seen as easy prey and is generally not exceeding the speed limit anyway
3658637 people are sick and tired of the way things are conducted
3658638 the presumption of innocence the right to freedom and the right to not be subjected to unfair judicial practice are entrenched in our constitution
3658639 these principles clash with the procedure of speed trapping by means of a camera and then notifying the offender later that he had been trapped
3658640 most other criminal offences are heard in court on the following working day after the alleged offence took place
3658641 no opportunity is afforded him or her to prepare a defence
3658642 how then does the motorist exercise his constitutional right in a court of law he is presumed guilty until he can prove otherwise
3658643 we dont just wake up one morning and decide we are going to put up speed traps on a certain road
3658644 jackson can go to court to argue his case is he implying that everybody can just drive the way they like everywhere in the world there are legal speed limits
3658645 more time to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3658646 but they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3658647 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3658648 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3658649 physical therapists are often one of the first health care providers that patients with acute low back pain encounter whether they are referred by medical doctors or visit them directly which offers evidenced based pts a tremendous opportunity to help patients recover
3658650 considering that low back pain will affect between sixty and eighty percent of americans during their lifetime the potential cost savings of an early effective intervention to prevent individuals from progressing to chronic disability may be considerable
3658651 the findings from this research can be applied throughout all fields of medicine not just to physical therapy
3658652 if all physicians and therapists adhere to their fields recommended clinical practice guidelines they too should see a decrease in subsequent health care utilization it is our hope that this research will help physical therapists as well as all medical professionals do their job more effectively
3658653 hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate
3658654 im angry that because of no fault of my own i am having to suffer with just about enough to pay my accounts and the interest on an overdraft that i had to arrange to cover costs when it happened
3658655 when the fraud took place i tried to remember if anything odd had happened concerning my atm card in the previous few days i didnt think it could relate to something which happened three weeks before
3658656 but he must have somehow in a second or two he must have grabbed my card out of the atm and swiped it through the scanner in his hand before giving it back to me
3658657 but i still feel pretty stupid as i am usually so wary when im withdrawing money
3658658 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months
3658659 it is only a matter of time before the resulting weakness in firms revenues results in more widespread job cuts
3658660 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3658661 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3658662 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3658663 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3658664 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3658665 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3658666 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3658667 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3658668 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3658669 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3658670 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3658671 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3658672 lynn hershman leesons strange culture an introduction by jackie stacey
3658673 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3658674 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3658766 what we do onstage is a reproduction of what we do on film so obviously music dancing and singing are an integral part
3658767 well perform huge choreographed numbers to recorded pieces but well also sing along and recite some dialogue from the films and interact with the audience
3658768 i think we all grew up hearing songs from amitabh bachchan movies in the car with our parents and film music and copying the movies choreographed dancing is really popular at indian pakistani weddings
3658769 that industry is a big part of our lives so i guess this show is a really big deal especially because who knows if amitabh will ever tour again
3658770 i thought of that 20 years ago and im back so one never knows im just thankful people still consider me a performer its very gratifying
3658771 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3658772 there were some scenes that we thought to be too dangerous but she insisted on doing away with the body double and also the wirings
3658773 shes very athletic it runs in her family then there was akshay kumar to inspire her akshay had done so much on screen action it was a novel experience for deepika and she sailed through the action she worked really hard to get the posture and power in the action scenes those whove seen her in om shanti om will be shocked
3658774 the films flavour comes from akshays real life hes a boy from chandni chowk in old delhi who went to bangkok as a cook my writer sridhar raghavan wrote the role with akshays real life story in mind
3658775 the characters personality comes alive through akshay thanks to him we finished ahead of schedule
3658776 chandni chowk to china is a childrens film i dont think kids will try to attempt to climb the nearest wall to fight after watching the film but well have lots of kids joining karate classes
3658777 before i started making this film my interest in the martial arts was restricted to jackie chan et li bruce lee and the crouching tigers of the world but akshay brought out the hidden dragon in me
3658778 he made me watch a lot of action scenes before we left for china hed make me sit down every morning and make me watch one kung fu film and explain the subtexts by the time we left to shoot i understood the martial arts much better
3658779 all the shooting is done finally we indians have invaded china we were gone for 95 days we shot for 89 days in shanghai and in the interiors of china and lots of action sequences on top of the great wall of china
3658780 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
3658781 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
3658782 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
3658783 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage
3658784 she is the most fashionable girl from a metro with all the latest trends in fashion she can be seen wearing shorts jeans and other trendy dresses
3658785 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
3658786 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now
3658787 siddharth anand the director asked me to keep the look of the film young trendy and vibrant he said it has to be a hip hot and sexy looking film which it has finally turned out to be
3658788 kareena has a fantastic sense of attitude and style and she can carry off anything in the world
3658789 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3658790 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3658791 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3658792 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3658793 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3658794 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3658795 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it

3658813 we need visions and ideals when running for any post in the party and the visions will not be achieved merely by an individuals effort alone we need a team to accomplish those visions
3658814 we follow a leader because we have seen what he has done for the party i support ka ting not because he is the party president but because he has brought about so many changes and reforms to the party but luck was not on his side
3658815 if you think that what i have insisted and followed are wrong and therefore you dont vote for me but you support me if what i have done or practised have brought some benefits to the party then why should you see who and who in a team is it because you have voted for a person because of another leader
3658816 i may be suppressed by someone today or be highly appreciated but is that my fault
3658817 on issues about the women we must still be more sensitive and understanding compared to the men however we also must not treat other major issues as exclusive ones for men only since politics is about managing issues related to the general public we shouldnt be contented with managing only issues related to women
3658818 well you can say that we have organised some very successful and popular activities but that does not mean we do not go into other more serious major issues
3658819 for example the recent religious conversion issue has been treated as a sensitive issue as a matter of fact whether an issue is sensitive depends on the attitude with which we look at or discuss this issue if it is a rational analysis to get to the root of the problem instead of confrontational or extremist or emotional forum then why should it be disallowed

3658861 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan

3658878 we were looking for an amazingly fast swim the way hed swam in prelims and semifinals at least a second better than that
3658879 but thats not just with swimming we do that with everything if we lived in the taj mahal after six months it would be home
3658880 he sort of defies description because in my opinion there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work thus far you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation on top of this he is a fantastic competitor very mentally tough and he appears thus far to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
3658881 its good to see kobe bryant is there to see the greatest athlete in the world if kobe goes out and wins a gold medal in badminton thats what its like to see this guy win the 200 fly and swim that leg in the 400 free

3658883 hes so young and yet so experienced and so clever hes the man hes my no 1 favorite
3658884 the expectations are so high but he puts it high for himself you come in as the world record holder but still youve got to prove it it is the moment sublime the moment of truth he is always ready i really really hope hes going to get the eight

3658905 we never stop looking for ways of improving the action on the track the two pit stops in the feature race have proved to be the really high pressure points of the events we felt an additional one would not only add another variable into the sprint race mix but also give the crews another opportunity to display their team work when we sat down to discuss ways of improving the series from every viewpoint this was a popular addition however we have also made other changes that will give the teams greater flexibility in certain areas
3658906 the automotive industry is now focusing on its environmental obligations to reduce co2 emissions and improve efficiencies and we are seeing the high technology capabilities of lotus engineering being in strong demand not only does our brand value of performance through light weight fit perfectly with the necessary direction of the industry to produce lighter more efficient vehicles we are also working on all aspects of future fuels investigating alternative powertrains to accommodate alcohol fuels as they enter the market
3658907 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation taking full advantage of the benefits of sustainable bio alcohols will ensure a greater percentage of vehicle miles will be travelled using renewable fuels we are delighted with the investment from defra which will assist this partnership in taking forward research development and the demonstration of this environmentally conscious transport solution
3658908 the requirement to operate on gasoline in todays flex fuel engines limits their thermal efficiency when operating on alcohol fuels however the physical and chemical properties of alcohols when compared to gasoline provide the potential for higher thermal efficiency operation to be achieved this single cylinder research engine will investigate a highly thermal efficient combustion system that optimises engine performance to fully exploit the properties of both gasoline and alcohol fuels and maximise efficiency

3658953 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3658954 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3658955 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3658956 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3658957 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda

3658959 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3658960 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3658961 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3658962 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3658963 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3658964 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3658965 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3658966 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3658967 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3658968 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3658969 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3658970 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3658971 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3658972 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3658973 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3658974 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3658975 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3658976 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3658977 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3658978 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3658979 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3658980 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3658981 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3658982 upbeat r amp b type stuff dance or hip hop
3658983 theres a rumour he neville used to play a bit of guitar
3658984 apart from getting a bit mad that its being played too loudly
3658985 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3658986 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3658987 for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3658988 im ok with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3658989 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3658990 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3658991 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3658992 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right

3658994 at this point it is well understood that continuous inflammation is also linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and most cancers particularly those occurring in adults
3658995 in the past the prevailing scientific notion was that pathogen associated molecular patterns or pamps cause inflammation by activating the immune system when pathogens such as viruses parasites fungi and bacteria invade the body this type of immune response occurs in the setting of infection at this symposium scientists will present research linking the damps inflammatory response to chronic diseases including arthritis obesity atherosclerosis and cancer

3659000 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3659001 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3659002 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3659003 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3659004 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3659005 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3659006 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3659007 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years

3659016 for years now nearly every poll has shown that the american people are right in sync with the platform of the democratic party they are pro environment rights and pro choice they dont like war they want the minimum wage raised and they want a single payer universal health care system the american public agrees with the republican party on only one major issue they support the death penalty so you would think the democrats would be cleaning up election after election obviously not the democrats appear to be professional losers they are so pathetic in their ability to win elections they even lose when they win so when you hear democrats and liberals and supporters of barack obama say they are worried that john mccain has a good chance of winning they aint a kidding who would know better than the very people who have handed the republicans one election after another on a silver platter

3659029 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3659030 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3659031 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3659032 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3659033 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3659034 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on

3659083 prosperity gospel is no gospel because what it does is offer to people what they want as natural people you dont have to be born again to want to be wealthy and therefore you dont have to be converted to be saved by the prosperity gospel when you appeal to people to come to christ on the basis of what they already want 1st corinthians 2 makes no sense the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit they are foolishness to him therefore if you offer to ppl what they do not consider foolishness in the natural man youre not preaching the gospel and the prosperity gospel offers to people what they desperately want as fallen people gives it to them and grows huge churches i cant believe what we tolerate in the church so i am on a crusade to crucify the prosperity gospel

3659097 this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3659098 these tumors are certainly more aggressive early on but the outlook is good for women with these tumors who survive for five years
3659099 we can now tell these women that their risk for developing a recurrence is lower than for women with er positive tumors
3659100 breast cancer patients still have risk of relapse after five years of systemic therapy
3659101 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3659102 the sample for this study was a low income population
3659103 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3659104 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3659105 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3659106 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale

3659108 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3659109 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3659110 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3659111 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3659112 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will

3659121 its a bit of a no brainer that im supporting fashion targets breast cancer because it funds breakthroughs vital work part of which i feel particularly strongly about education
3659122 my mums experience shows that early detection is the best way forward when it comes to breast cancer i hope that through its education work breakthrough breast cancer can drive this message home because early diagnosis saves lives
3659123 as a woman i feel it is important to support this wonderful campaign i was shocked when i saw the latest uk figures 1 in 9 women are diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lifetime
3659124 the fashion targets breast cancer campaign makes so much sense
3659125 breakthroughs vision is a future free from the fear of breast cancer i really do believe that together we can help breakthrough achieve this i can only reiterate what this years advertising campaign is saying whatever your reason please please wear one
3659126 please follow my lead whatever our personal reasons for wearing a fashion targets breast cancer t shirt or even giving it to a friend i can reassure you that we all have one thing in common we are helping breakthrough achieve its vision of a future free from the fear of breast cancer thats something we should all be proud of i certainly am thank you so much for your support
3659127 like lots of people ive lost friends to breast cancer i think its important that every woman backs fashion targets breast cancer and the charity that benefits from the campaign breakthrough breast cancer weve got to beat this terrible disease and breakthrough is helping us to do this i love this years t shirt and im sure it will be a sell out this summer
3659128 my real reason for supporting fashion targets breast cancer is simple no less than 4 50 from this t shirt goes directly to breakthrough breast cancer so there really is no excuse is there i want to see every one of you wearing this t shirt with pride and supporting this fantastic charity just think you could look as you good as me well without the airbrushing and the girdle
3659129 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3659130 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3659131 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3659132 there are currently no approved drugs to treat ph associated with copd and it is estimated that this disease may affect up to six million people worldwide
3659133 these patients have a very poor prognosis and consequently there is a significant unmet medical need for an effective treatment we believe that prx 08066 may be the only 5 ht2b antagonist being developed for pulmonary hypertension that has the potential to selectively and safely reduce pulmonary artery blood pressure in these patients without affecting their systemic blood pressure
3659134 there is an undeniable need for safe and effective treatments for patients with ph associated with copd
3659135 we believe this drug may be an important advance toward effective treatment for patients with this progressive lung disease and hope to see reductions in pulmonary artery blood pressure and improvements in exercise capacity in this trial similar to those seen in previous trials with prx 08066 using more rigorous techniques
3659136 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable
3659137 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3659138 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3659139 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3659140 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3659141 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3659142 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3659143 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3659144 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3659145 what is surprising is that such effects may pop up seventy or eighty years after birth
3659146 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
3659147 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3659148 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
3659149 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3659150 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3659151 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3659152 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3659153 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3659154 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3659155 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3659156 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3659157 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3659158 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3659159 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3659160 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3659161 stabilizing the size of the human population and reducing its consumption
3659162 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3659163 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3659164 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3659165 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear
3659166 academic ecological papers are often tinseled with one or two sentences about the applied significance of the science which accomplishes little
3659167 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3659168 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3659169 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3659170 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3659171 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves

3659174 building more extra high voltage 765 kv transmission lines in indiana can provide significant economic and environmental benefits
3659175 the ability of electric utilities to continue providing reliable reasonably priced electricity to fuel our nations economic growth is increasingly challenged by aging insufficient infrastructure continued growth in electrical load rising construction costs and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these issues can be managed more successfully through strategic expansion of our nations transmission grid including significant investment in extra high voltage transmission
3659176 indiana is home to nearly 27 000 megawatts of generation and the states transmission system delivers electricity across the midwest and beyond to continue reliable delivery of this energy and add the output of new generation that has been proposed in the state indiana needs additional extra high voltage transmission capacity a reliable supply of electricity is fundamental to our quality of life and economic growth and indianas transmission system which was largely completed more than 25 years ago needs to grow as well to continue to meet the needs we have today and in the future
3659177 like most parts of the country indiana will see significant benefits from extra high voltage transmission expansion the need to build additional transmission provides the opportunity to invest in a long term transmission solution that will facilitate development of additional generation including renewables and support the reliable transport of electricity to fuel future economic growth for example more than 3 000 megawatts of wind power has been proposed in central indiana but additional transmission is necessary to bring it online
3659178 building more extra high voltage 765 kv transmission lines in indiana can provide significant economic and environmental benefits a 765 kv transmission line requires less land to carry more power than lower voltage lines and the 765 kv line would cost less than half as much to build a 765 kv transmission line also operates more efficiently than lower voltage lines reducing the amount of electricity that needs to be generated by reducing line loss electricity lost during transport the new 765 kv designs that would be used for this project have line losses of less than one percent compared with losses as high as 10 percent for a lower voltage alternative

3659181 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3659182 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3659183 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3659184 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3659185 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3659186 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3659187 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3659188 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3659189 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3659190 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3659191 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3659192 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3659193 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day

3659231 our recommendations have not changed since we issued them this spring rather we issued a clarification as a result of confusion and concern among the public and healthcare professionals routine use of ecgs to assess these children has not ever been part of our recommendations
3659232 contradicts the carefully considered and evidence based recommendations of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry and the american academy of pediatrics
3659233 until these questions can be answered a recommendation to obtain routine ecgs for children receiving adhd medications is not warranted
3659234 using aha criteria the aap would at most classify this recommendation as iib the level of evidence is less well established by evidence opinion additional studies with broad objectives needed in addition using the aap classification of recommendations the aap would assign the recommendation a category d level of evidence on the basis of expert opinion without even observational studies
3659235 accordingly the aap would recommend against such routine ecg screening
3659236 it suggests that as many as 8 of children should be treated with amphetamines or related stimulant drugs these drugs increase blood pressure and have not been studied in long term trials the statement asserts that sudden death is not more common in children receiving these drugs however the fda has issued a warning for all of the adhd drugs that states that they can cause sudden death at usual doses it is irresponsible for a professional medical society to recommend to its members that they ignore an fda mandated warning this is the second time in a few weeks where the aap has issued poorly thought out guidelines that promote inappropriate drug use in children the previous statement promoted statin use in children as young as eight years of age

3659238 gt current trends in cardiac resynchronization therapy and stein highlight the most recent clinical trial data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of icds and cardiac resynchronization therapy crt devices and their potential impact on clinical practice
3659239 this highlights how little we know about the molecular consequences of cardiac and brain death as it pertains to transplantation its fairly interesting that seemingly the best organ for a white recipient is a white brain dead donor and the best organ for a black recipient is from a black cardiac death donor
3659240 using cardiac death donors is a relatively new thing initially people were concerned that kidneys from cardiac death donors wouldnt be ideal but multiple studies have now shown you can achieve outcomes with cardiac death donor kidneys that are essentially the same as outcomes with organs from brain dead donors as long as certain criteria are adhered to people are beginning to realize that particularly with young donors who die of cardiac death you can achieve pretty excellent results
3659241 optimization of this untapped donor source could dramatically increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation each year
3659242 one is that outcome with cardiac death donors appears to be less racially disparate than outcomes with brain death donation second and more specifically black recipients achieve the best long term kidney graft survival when they receive a kidney from a black donor who had a cardiac death
3659243 in 2005 the institute of medicine found that in the us there were 22 000 potential cardiac death donors yet if you look at kidney transplants we performed less than 600 so these results provide more evidence demonstrating that cardiac death kidneys can perform as well as and in some cases slightly better than brain death organs what im hoping is that this will encourage more organ donation
3659244 increased recovery of organs donated after cardiac death from black donors may mitigate existing racial disparities and improve outcomes for black renal transplant recipients
3659245 we have a sentence in the paper where we specifically argue against using this information to direct patient level decisions or to alter current allocation algorithms simply because of how few black recipients have ever received a black cardiac death organ
3659246 in the current environment there is still an organ shortage crisis
3659247 so if we were to say based on this data black recipients should wait for a kidney that comes from a black donor who died of cardiac death the black recipient would be disadvantaged by that we all know that getting a kidney transplant is much better than staying on dialysis no matter what donor
3659248 we can only speculate that this underuse might be related to providers fears of adverse events such as hyperkalemia or sudden increases in serum creatinine particularly because these patients both are older and have diagnosed ckd
3659249 because neither primary adjusted filling rates of prescribed drugs after discharge nor adjusted adherence to initiated medication regimens differed between patients with chronic kidney disease and those without diagnosed kidney disease other mechanisms are likely responsible for the observed adjusted morbidity and mortality difference between patients with better vs more reduced kidney function
3659250 improving medication use after mi may improve outcomes in the population overall but not necessarily serve to close the mortality gap across categories of kidney function
3659251 the development of candidate therapies and proof of their efficacy to reduce cardiovascular risk in kidney disease should be a top priority for the investment of private and public funds especially given the high and increasing prevalence of kidney disease
3659252 although our results do not prove that coronary heart disease causes reduced cognitive function we have shown a strong link and it is likely that the risk factors for heart disease are also risk factors for cognitive function
3659253 our results should be an added incentive for controlling these risk factors such as bad diet sedentary lifestyle smoking blood pressure and lipids we know these things contribute to heart disease and now we suspect they also contribute to cognitive decline
3659254 our core hypothesis is that cognitive decline starts earlier in life than widely accepted so identifying risk factors for this cognitive decline is vitally important
3659255 we have shown that if you get chd you are more likely to suffer reduced cognitive function we dont know that this will definitely translate into dementia but we believe it is likely that this would be the case
3659256 until now research on the link between cardiovascular disease and dementia has focused more on cerebrovascular disease than chd however it is chd and not cerebrovascular disease that makes up the bulk of cardiovascular disease and is a major health problem in the developed world
3659257 our results should give an added incentive to reduce the risk factors for chd as by so doing we could also be reducing the chances of cognitive decline
3659258 this is always problematic as people with the poorest cognition are the most difficult to keep track of and they tend to be the ones who drop out as a result these associations are always underestimated but we are doing our best to try and pick these people up
3659259 and is the first time that a hormone has been found to be associated with af
3659260 so that was kind of functional evidence that this was not a neutral peptide or a coincidental finding
3659261 obviously we need to do further work to see how this mutant peptide is causing af but this offers a new potential target for drug therapy for af
3659262 although we need to do further studies and this is purely speculative we suspect that this mutant anp is probably working through the regular pathways of anp but its not been broken down as easily because there are high levels of it this may be causing toxic injury to the heart in the long term and in the short term having electrophysiological effects
3659263 if we can understand better how this mutant peptide is causing af we may be able to make for instance a blocker of this peptide that doesnt have the same side effect profile as an ion channel blocker that has really been the limitation in treating af most of the drugs we have are not specific for the atria they affect the ventricles as well and so we have some proarrhythmia
3659264 but we are hopeful that this means that normal anp or its receptor might be manipulated in some way in people with more sporadic forms of af this offers a really novel target that will hopefully open up some new pathways for new treatments for af its a totally new direction that we can attack and hopefully provide something beneficial for patients
3659265 666 according to christian myths but what if you were born to the world with no real purpose just one of those unexplained phenomena in the human genome what would life then mean to you
3659266 we speculate that one reason for poor outcome in persistent af might be that the depth of penetration using the cryoballoon technique is inadequate
3659267 possibly the strategy of atrial pulmonary vein isolation or the cryoballoon device does not produce sufficient substrate modification as required in persistent af
3659268 similar to rates previously reported for radio frequency catheter ablation
3659269 we believe the addition of exercise ecg will give a good improvement of the evaluation of cardiac abnormalities in both young and older athletes
3659270 we included all people who wanted to participate in official sports and we found that there was an increased risk of being disqualified from sports over the age of 30
3659271 incorporating an exercise ecg into preparticipation screening was quite helpful in identifying an older population of athletes who are at risk of coronary artery disease so there is a message here that when screening an older population of competitive athletes ie those aged over 30 considering a stress or exercise ecg might be quite beneficial
3659272 had shown negative or innocent findings on resting ecg but clear pathological alterations during the exercise test
3659273 these studies indicate ecg screening in athletes results in an acceptable proportion of abnormal findings that can be of clinical significance
3659274 importantly in sofis study 153 of the 159 true positives involving athletes ultimately disqualified from sport with an identified cardiovascular disorder would have been overlooked on history and physical examination alone thus although a detailed personal and family history and physical examination will detect an important but limited number of athletes with underlying cardiovascular disease adding electrocardiography to the screening process will detect more athletes with silent cardiovascular disorders at risk of sudden death
3659275 the existing evidence supports a systematic preparticipation screening program for all competitive athletes using a comprehensive personal and family history questionnaire physical examination and screening electrocardiography to identify those at risk
3659276 but even in the young we found quite a relevant percentage of people who did not show anything on baseline ecg but revealed something on exercise ecg
3659277 to show if disqualification of such people reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events among athletes
3659278 in italy we say we think its better to start with something than with nothing
3659279 we are doing more cath ablations but some people are not good candidates for this for example obese patients in whom we see poor fluoroscopic imaging with catheter ablation and a high risk of vascular complications
3659280 is a significant step forward for many patients who would not be offered anything else
3659281 we dramatically increased our success rate after we started to dissect the fat off the atrium starting in june 2007
3659282 they do have a lot of af immediately after the operation but then it disappears
3659283 this is feasible and safe for experienced surgeons and the results are quite good even in those with prior cath ablation
3659284 my perception is that both of these procedures epicardial and catheter ablation are evolving and we are going to learn that the minimally invasive surgical approach is good for certain groups and that catheter ablation is good for others
3659285 often requires multiple procedures and has proven difficult to treat with catheter ablation i think this patient population is going to turn out to have the best overall results for one procedure success with epicardial ablation
3659286 we can make a series of points next to the line of ablation and we can make the line and test it but it may be blocked because that muscle is stunned but not killed and then af may recur its also hard to get to some areas to perfectly complete the line with a catheter
3659287 surgically you are going to be a little more selective in the lines you make because your access is going to be limited but where you do have access you can create an area of full thickness damage all the more easily
3659288 with epicardial ablation you can be more assured with proper testing that you can make ablation lines in the left atrium that are going to be permanently blocked
3659289 the results will be better if you have an electrophysiologist to perform mapping at the start and the end of the procedure to confirm that the line has been successfully ablated mapping is becoming key

3659298 the lack of superiority of combination therapy over epinephrine alone regardless of the patient subgroup suggests it may be futile to add vasopressin to epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support
3659299 there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vasopressin as an alternative to or in combination with adrenaline in any cardiac arrest rhythm

3659303 we know that gender influences outcome in many other cardiac diseases such as heart failure arrhythmias mi and so on but there has not been any real investigation into the gender differences in congenital heart disease before with the exception of some observational data
3659304 we have a large database of adults with congenital heart disease so we were able to look at the effect of gender on outcomes in these patients
3659305 but if i see a male with a congenital defect im going to be more prone to ask him if he sees a dentist regularly
3659306 with women for example im going to be more likely to refer them earlier for surgery because of the smaller aortas the bottom line is that we need to look at the individual patient males are not equal to females gender has a different impact on outcomes

3659309 survival following exercise related sca in young individuals has been poor over the past seven years in the united states
3659310 despite the poor survival rate there is a statistically significant trend toward improved survival in recent years and there may be a concurrent trend toward increased automated external defibrillator aed use
3659311 reliance on media reports is one of the only means of identifying cases of exercise related sca the impact of sudden death in a young athlete is disproportionately large and the low survival rate should compel the medical community to support methods for better investigation prevention and secondary management of these events should they occur
3659312 but instead of heat cryoablation uses cold and the lesions that you create are progressive this is an emerging technology that appears to have a lower complication rate than rf ablation its quite exciting and the safety is there but we need some more years to look at it and compare it with rf ablation
3659313 was probably because his team was very aggressive with anticoagulation during the procedure stemming from when we used rf ablation
3659314 is a very effective treatment for paroxysmal af with temporary phrenic nerve palsy being the main complication
3659315 so we stopped trying to make the procedures shorter and started doing two freezes per vein or three or four compared with the one freeze we had begun with and we started to see better results
3659316 there were no thromboembolic events no pulmonary vein stenosis no esophageal injury and no coronary artery injury
3659317 we had a 74 success rate in paroxysmal af with cryoablation which is comparable to that achieved with alternative forms of ablation and adds to the impressive data from dr van belle and his colleagues in rotterdam
3659318 in our area survival of very old out of hospital cardiac arrest is excellent and even more elevated than in the general population this can be explained by frequent attendance of very old peoples dwellings by nursing staff trained in cpr who can also alert ems earlier than lay witnesses
3659319 heart rate and heart rate variability reflecting autonomic changes during different sleep stages persist in the elderly but may not follow patterns previously reported in younger subjects
3659320 we are looking for normal heart rate variability changes over the night by sleep stage we want to see how this identifies high risk in elderly people
3659321 we think that once we find out what normal is we can begin to see correlations
3659322 my interest in it is as a marker of normal vs abnormal neurocognitive function but nobody actually knows what normal is
3659323 just the ecg signal by itself is a source of amazing information we can pick up sleep apnea we can pick up naps and also wake up time
3659324 also unlike prior reports low frequency vs high frequency ratio extracted from 106 polysomnograms was not highest in rem but in stage 2 39 vs 41 respectively
3659325 except for vlf power the presence of severe sleep apnea does not affect these relationships or heart rate variability and sleep stage in the elderly
3659326 this study found that there was less heart rate variability in the elderly during sleep and that really has not been looked at before
3659327 so the question is is there underlying heart disease in the elderly or is this just a normal aging pattern
3659328 these patients are more vulnerable to sudden death to cardiac morbidity and mortality and the heart rate variability is lost as a precursor of these changes
3659329 the next study that needs to be done is to look at the healthy population with less heart rate variability and see whether they have any detectable underlying heart disease to see if this reflects a degeneration of the heart degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart or whether this reflects just a normal aging pattern
3659330 we have a data set of younger people that needs to be analyzed
3659331 but those subjects are all males and it might be different in men and women
3659332 its not necessarily any faster for performing af ablation but the hope is that a system such as this will increase the ability of physicians who dont do this every day to perform this procedure allowing more centers to offer this therapy
3659333 the authors should be congratulated for this initial effort i agree that the feasibility and safety of the system has been demonstrated although there are some lingering concerns this observational study provides a starting point for hypothesis driven trials to establish the real value of this technology
3659334 still people need to understand that we have looked at the worldwide experience with this new robotic catheter system and found that the complication of pericardial effusion was 1 2 which is in the range reported in the literature for manual puncturing
3659335 if we give something like these new technologies to all electrophysiologists we will allow them to do this procedure without going through extensive training and without requiring exceptional technical skills which means that the number of operators can increase exponentially and more patients will have access to ablation in a shorter time

3659340 weve known for a long time that diabetes which is an end stage manifestation of insulin resistance is strongly associated with peripheral artery disease
3659341 what we found interesting about the association was that there was a trend across all levels of insulin resistance and that the impact is distinct from the end stage manifestation of insulin resistance that insulin resistance in and of itself before diabetes is associated with pad
3659342 the most important thing is that its not just diabetes but the entire spectrum of insulin resistance that is important and associated with pad
3659343 people need to be thinking about diet exercise and weight loss and working toward reducing atherosclerotic risk factors insulin resistance being one of them with the hopes of reducing the risk of manifestations of atherosclerosis such as peripheral artery disease
3659344 a lot of the work done on the role of inflammation and atherosclerosis has been done in healthy individuals with mixed data using crp as a marker of various types of atherosclerosis in populations who already have underlying atherosclerotic risk factors
3659345 the crp findings generate hypotheses and start to make us think about the complicated manner in which these disease states together affect atherosclerosis and the complex interplay of those risk factors
3659346 its important for pad to be on our radar screens
3659347 it has been relatively common practice that patients with cardiac involvement in myotonic dystrophy receive pacemakers to try to prevent sudden death and what we have found from our study is that it did not appear that pacemakers were effective in preventing sudden death
3659348 its overall prevalence is about one in 8000 people so its still a relatively rare disease
3659349 stymied because studies have failed to enroll and follow a sufficiently large prospectively characterized population without referral bias
3659350 as a result the optimal clinical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias is unclear as is the effect of therapeutic interventions on the risk of sudden death
3659351 my recommendation is that patients considered high risk should be referred to a cardiac electrophysiologist and then the discussion can take place regarding appropriate therapy
3659352 however we did not observe that pacemakers decreased the rates of sudden death or death from any cause
3659353 we and others have recognized that patients with myotonic dystrophy continue to die suddenly despite having functioning pacemakers
3659354 lends support to the concept that cardioverter defibrillators could be beneficial in preventing sudden death
3659355 both cardiology and neurology should carefully work together to try to properly address this issue
3659356 some people might say that ethically its not fair to do that but the fact is that we do not know how this population fares over time or what will be the role of these devices
3659357 the business employment dynamics bed data series include gross job gains and gross job losses at the establishment level by major industry sector and for the 50 states as well as gross job gains and gross job losses at the firm level by employer size class gross job gains are the sum of increases in employment from expansions at existing units and the addition of new jobs at opening units gross job losses are the result of contractions in employment at existing units and the loss of jobs at closing units the difference between the number of gross jobs gained and the number of gross jobs lost is the net change in employment
3659358 a study by two economists that argues that drilling in anwr would produce an immediate drop in oil prices even if the oil did not enter refineries for several years interestingly this study was rejected for publication in the energy journal not because they disagreed with the findings but because they considered the studys conclusion so obvious that it was not worth publishing
3659359 the bush administration wants americans to believe that drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coastlines will ease our pain at the gas pump in reality it would lower gas prices by mere pennies and that would be 20 years from now
3659360 the arctic national wildlife refuge with its varied and sensitive ecosystems should be preserved that pristine area must remain off limits
3659361 in short there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known
3659362 with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3659363 between 1993 and 2007 there were 651 spills of all sizes at ocs facilities in federal waters three miles or more offshore that released 47 800 barrels of oil with 7 5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156 900 barrels produced thats not to minimize the danger but no form of energy is perfect or without trade offs besides if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important its hard to explain why the united states should rule out drilling off its own coasts
3659364 we found that a low level of hdl c may be a risk factor for memory loss in late midlife this suggests that low hdl c might also be a risk factor for dementia
3659365 many previous investigations into the association between lipids and memory in the elderly have focused on total or ldl cholesterol because of their status as proven risk factors for cardiovascular disease our findings emphasize the need to expand the focus to hdl cholesterol thus physicians and patients should be encouraged to monitor levels of hdl cholesterol
3659366 tempting to speculate that increasing levels of hdl c might protect our good memories
3659367 we should remain extremely cautious when proposing therapeutic intervention on the basis of observational studies that do not imply causation this is particularly true for a study with a number of important limitations such as that of singh manoux et al
3659368 thus hdl c remains a potentially promising but still remote target in the prevention of dementia and memory loss nonetheless these studies demand that we focus more effort on research at the interface between hdl c and brain function
3659369 they are endowed with a supply of positive charge carrying holes that for years have been the missing ingredients that prevented engineers from building leds from zno nanowires
3659370 zinc oxide nanostructures are incredibly well studied because they are so easy to make now that we have p type zinc oxide nanowires the opportunities for leds and beyond are endless
3659371 p type doping in nanowires would make complementary zno nanowire transistors possible
3659372 when we use current electroanatomic systems with image integration we obtain an mri image before the procedure and then import that image into the system
3659373 such systems give us far greater anatomic information than fluoroscopy alone can provide but we cannot visualize the heart motion or changes in its volume during the procedure the thought here is if we use real time mri we can actually see the catheters see the heart and see the anatomic detail at the time were doing the procedure
3659374 currently one of the differences between mri and x ray is that with x ray you get a projection image where were able to see the entire catheter
3659375 were very used to that and its very user friendly with mri you dont get a projection view so you dont see the entire catheter you get only the area where you have requested the scan having said that once we find the tip of the catheter we get very high soft tissue resolution so were able to see the heart the walls of the heart and the blood vessels as long as we can find the right plane with the mri scanner the resolution is much improved new catheters are being developed that will direct the scanner to visualize the appropriate image plane automatically
3659376 to successfully perform routine real time mri guided ep procedures we have to address potential current induction and heating inside any catheters that we choose to use in the mri scanner
3659377 we had quite a bit of filtering and also used low energy scans to limit the amount of heating in our current study we are now working on addressing these potential concerns for a wider variety of catheters including those used for ablation once the technology matures real time mri guidance may become the routine with x ray we just dont see the tissues that we would like to see

3659382 the jumbo mortgage market is relatively cushioned from the credit crunch as borrowers are obviously wealthier and will generally have high levels of
3659383 employers have long recognised the value of offering life assurance as part of the overall benefits mix to attract and retain the best talent
3659384 corporate life assurance rates are currently very competitive often significantly lower than the rates that can be obtained by an individual
3659385 this provides the employer with the opportunity to give and communicate a cost effective tax free benefit that employees really want and indeed will often pay for themselves
3659386 repossession is the last resort and every possible alternative should be investigated first
3659387 such a dramatic increase in repossessions suggests that some lenders are approaching the problem too rigidly and that staff that are inexperienced in handling an increasing repossession as the only solution
3659388 our advice would be to seek expert arrears handling support and as and when necessary look to employ lawyers who have no vested interest in taking possession of a property
3659389 i think we have to adjust to being spot up shooters all of us were not acclimated to being spot up shooters so thats something we have to tweak a little bit and get used to

3659423 non vedo spazi per un ulteriore sacrificio sociale ed economico da parte dellitalia ci sono situazioni molto piu gravi dove lattenzione dei media e delle televisioni e assolutamnete inesistente come il darfur o il corno dafrica in cui migliaia e migliaia dipersone rischiano di morire e dove i conflitti in queste aree hanno gia provocato 500 mila morti e dunque sbagliato andare a fare effetti cinematografici in georgia

3659433 the couple had not intended to publicise their marriage but decided to confirm the event due to mounting media speculation
3659434 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him still wearing sunglasses during the ceremony i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3659435 it was completely surreal and more than that it was quite magical
3659436 it was bigger than i expected because there are literally roads going off everywhere one minute you are at the tube station and the next you are outside the police station it literally is like a real mini village
3659437 i did feel an honour as over the years so many great iconic characters have been and gone but the square remains the same
3659438 well hes a very laid back and easy going character
3659439 he doesnt think too far ahead hes a bit of a casanova definitely a jack the lad
3659440 hes very confident and streetwise and he reads people and situations very well which allows him to get what he wants
3659441 hes been sharing a flat with three girls but is chucked out when they realise that hes been sleeping with them all
3659442 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
3659443 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
3659444 everything is normal georgian roads are not dangerous and the railway leading to armenia is absolutely safe
3659445 cargo shipments by rail are being carried out as planned
3659446 the railway did not stop for a single minute it has continued to operate carrying both people and cargos
3659447 as a result of the bomb raids there have arisen difficulties in the work of the port of poti which have reflected negatively on cargo shipments
3659448 there were disruptions in our supplies for the past four or five days as no cargos were transported from georgia
3659449 we received ten rail cars of petrol overnight while other companies imported large quantities of diesel fuel but still we have a fairly large volume of fuel stocked in the batumi terminal
3659450 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3659451 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3659452 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3659453 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3659454 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3659455 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3659456 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3659457 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3659458 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3659462 4 in secondary table id 2 is not equal to 4 so it looks like
3659463 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3659464 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3659465 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3659466 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3659467 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3659468 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3659469 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3659470 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3659471 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3659472 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3659473 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3659474 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3659475 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3659476 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3659477 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3659478 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3659479 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3659480 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3659481 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3659482 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3659483 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3659484 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3659485 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3659486 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3659487 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3659488 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3659489 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3659490 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3659491 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
3659492 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3659493 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3659494 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3659495 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3659496 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3659497 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3659498 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3659499 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3659500 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3659501 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3659502 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3659503 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3659504 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3659505 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3659506 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3659507 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3659508 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3659509 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3659510 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3659511 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3659512 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3659513 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3659514 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3659515 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3659516 what it is trying to achieve is peace in this region
3659517 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3659518 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3659519 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3659520 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3659521 i think the political motive by russia is very clear to demonstrate to the world they couldnt care less about world reaction to continue to cripple the country
3659522 toiled through 2004 with the uncompetitive should ferrari mclaren or bmw throw their efforts behind one driver
3659523 hey the university of phoenix wants to use the end of
3659524 thank god thats really going to deflect some attention away from us
3659525 the endangered species act is failing in its mission to recover species and is crippling rural economies
3659526 a new system should strike a balance between protecting jobs and protecting the environment
3659527 will need to review this proposal to ensure we have a balanced approach to job creation and protection of our critical natural resources
3659528 whats up guys i was feeling very sexy this week and horny at the same time i was taking a very long
3659529 on return from beijing this morning i have been briefed on matters related to monika devi one of our weightlifters questions arose about her dope testing and the timing and release of the reports which led to her not being sent to beijing olympics

3659531 i have told him krishnamurthy to come to delhi at the earliest to hold his inquiry and to favour me with his report and recommendations at the earliest
3659532 as sports minister while i am determined to set up an independent technically proficient dope testing mechanism which has credibility in the world i am also anxious that no sports person should suffer due to any laxity or delay on the part of this testing mechanism

3659534 im too busy looking at art to be aware of my surroundings
3659535 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3659536 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3659537 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3659538 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3659544 it fall in crude prices is a happy sign it is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic retail prices
3659545 there still are huge under recoveries on fuel sales i dont see how we can reduce retail prices when our companies continue to lose money
3659546 our retail prices are pegged much lower current international crude prices there is no scope for reduction in petrol and diesel prices as of now

3659549 we are planning to open three more outlets in dublin cork and naas which will be up and running before the end of 2008 esquires is now well positioned in ireland to maximise growth opportunities by targeting traditional high street locations shopping centres and business parks

3659666 but theres also some profit taking on dollar asia by us houses after the run up in the last few days theres good two way interest at the moment
3659667 theres dollar buying against major currencies too so we have got to see whether this translates to dollar asia buying

3659677 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3659678 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3659679 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3659680 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3659681 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3659682 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it everybody stopped
3659683 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3659684 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3659685 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding
3659686 she was mentally prepared and then she had a mental break then after not doing the job on the beam on the floor exercise her concentration was bothered
3659687 i knew what it was going to be like ive been watching the scoring the past few days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it

3659690 image quality was good for a consumer model when viewing images fullscreen about 20 25 on my monitor images look sharp with good exposure and color balance is also pleasing when you inspect an image at 100 they dont look quite as great i noticed some noise even at the lowest iso 80 setting there was also some edge softness in most of our outdoor images image noise can be found at all of the iso settings getting worse as the sensitivity is increased however you can only see this when viewing an image at 100
3659691 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3659692 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3659695 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3659696 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3659697 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3659700 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3659701 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3659717 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3659718 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3659719 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3659720 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3659721 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3659722 weve got a lot to learn from the result but that will make us stronger and a better government
3659723 its a message that im determined to listen to determined to unravel and understand the elements of that message and respond to territorians concerns right across this great northern territory of ours

3659843 were going to be there to walk beside these teachers and help them realize science is a process
3659844 its not coming down they want to send a message that texas is going to teach science one way or another
3659845 we havent really had a guide in science telling teachers what they needed to get done
3659846 if teachers didnt take the initiative it got pushed to the back

3659864 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
3659865 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
3659866 fred looks in good nick to me hes played well at six before so theres no reason at all why he cant play well at six again
3659867 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
3659868 on this showing at the oval it allows you to pressure the batters for longer which had quite a big influence on the game

3659882 the principle therefore is well settled that it is for the investigating agency to submit a report to the magistrate after full and complete investigation the investigating agency may submit a report finding the allegations substantiated it is also open to the investigating agency to submit a report finding no material to support the allegations made in the first information report it is open to the magistrate concerned to accept the report or to order further enquiry but what is clear is that the magistrate cannot direct the investigating agency to submit a report that is in accord with his views even in a case where a report is submitted by the investigating agency finding that no case is made out for prosecution it is open to the magistrate to disagree with the report and to take cognizance but what he cannot do is to direct the investigating agency to submit a report to the effect that the allegations have been supported by the material collected during the course of investigation

3659900 die erholung der buckelwal population ist direkt auf den walfang stopp zur ckzuf hren
3659901 das ist eigentlich eine ziemliche deutliche antwort von allen gro walen sind die buckelwale diejenigen die am besten gedeihen wenn man sie in ruhe l t
3659902 japans regierung hatte im november 2007 beschlossen eine quote von 50 buckelwalen zu fangen
3659903 die buckelwale die die japaner t ten wollten sind jene mit denen die staaten gutes geld beim wal beobachten erzielen
3659904 auch wenn sich die best nde erholt haben sind sie immer noch meilenweit davon entfernt auch nur ann hernd jene zahl zu erreichen die sie vor dem anfang des kommerziellen walfangs hatten
3659905 das ergebnis war erstaunlich denn diese sippschaft die aus rund 50 tieren bestand blieb unter sich
3659906 es ist erschreckend wie schnell einige delfine und t mmler verschwinden
3659907 da gibt es keine walfangflotten und kein blutrot gef rbtes meer sie sterben leise in den engmaschigen netzen
3659908 research in recent years has demonstrated that even very little babies know a lot about the outside world this has led many to suggest that we are born with a great deal of the knowledge we need but these new findings urge us to think differently about early development despite having a good grasp of what goes on in the outside world young babies may have more difficulties in understanding how they themselves and their bodies fit into that world

3659915 chelsea want to be at a higher level than they are now
3659916 the board havent said to me that we must win this or that they just said to me try to improve on where we are now we need to win more competitions
3659917 we think it is an unconstitutional move and we chose to abstain from the proceedings
3659918 president musharraf is not a suitable candidate for the post of president
3659919 this is another victory for pakistans ruling coalition and democracy
3659920 people find these monotone sounds particularly unpleasant rather like the whining of a mosquito
3659921 these systems react autonomously to any change in frequency and damp the noise regardless of how fast the wind generator is turning
3659922 we have integrated sensors into the system they constantly measure the vibrations arising in the gearbox and pass on the results to the actuator control system
3659923 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3659924 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3659925 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3659926 to find this out we urgently need to carry out further tests the appropriate research applications have already been submitted
3659927 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3659928 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3659929 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3659930 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3659931 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3659932 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3659933 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new labour government has invested heavily in urban regeneration
3659934 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3659935 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3659936 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3659937 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities
3659938 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3659939 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements

3659948 her ideas are a rare if not entirely new approach to natural history
3659949 the science of selecting trees for different uses around the world has not been well studied
3659950 she holds fast to the notion that if you are in the aura of a black walnut tree theres a healing effect
3659951 it needs more science to be able to say that
3659952 in a walk through old growth forest there are thousands if not millions of chemicals and their synergistic effects with one another
3659953 what trees do chemically in the environment is something were only beginning to understand
3659954 we need more research of this kind to use the things we have such as trees to their fullest
3659955 theres an enormous difference between old growth forests and tree plantations
3659956 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3659957 what it is trying to achieve is peace in this region
3659958 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3659959 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3659960 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3659961 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3659962 i think the political motive by russia is very clear to demonstrate to the world they couldnt care less about world reaction to continue to cripple the country

3659965 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3659966 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3659967 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3659968 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife

3659971 in a year when the playing field is stacked enormously in favor of the democrats and obama this is an issue that seems to help republicans and theyre trying to make the most of it
3659972 republicans are trying to keep the issue alive because it works for them and the data suggests that the issue is working
3659973 have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas we can do that we can have a vote on that
3659974 theres clearly a lot at play right now and its hard to predict what votes we actually may see in the fall but what were focused on in august is having our folks in districts talking to their about why drilling is not a useful enterprise
3659975 people are so scared right now that theyre not really seeing a choice they want to do anything that might have an impact on gas prices
