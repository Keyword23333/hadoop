4720006 i received complaints from syabas and puncak niaga staffs that the management forced them and their family members to sign the memo otherwise they may have lost both opportunity of promotion and bonus
4720007 the origin source of this memo is very suspicious the memo praised the 2 companies throughout the content saying clean water and good complain service have been provided but we all know the water quality and services provided by them
4720008 the association may deemed syabas would support the move and lobby our staff to endorse the memo consequently led to misunderstanding

4720097 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses

4720104 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4720105 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4720106 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4720107 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4720108 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4720109 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community

4720125 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4720126 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4720127 it started as a gamble by georgia the former soviet republic and darling of the west move quickly into the reakaway pro russian enclave called south ossetia and take back what is legally georgias but the plan failed instead russian forces invaded georgia last week and crushed georgian resistance according to u s military officials russia is out to decimate the u s trained georgian armed forces
4720128 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4720129 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4720130 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4720131 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4720132 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4720133 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4720134 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4720135 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4720136 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4720137 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4720138 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4720139 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4720140 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4720141 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4720142 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4720143 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4720144 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4720145 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4720146 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4720147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4720148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4720149 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4720150 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4720151 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4720152 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4720153 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4720154 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4720155 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4720156 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4720157 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4720158 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4720159 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4720160 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4720161 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4720162 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4720163 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4720164 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4720165 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4720166 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4720167 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4720168 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4720169 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4720170 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4720171 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4720172 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4720173 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4720174 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4720175 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4720176 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4720177 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4720178 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4720179 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4720180 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4720181 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4720182 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4720183 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4720184 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4720185 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4720186 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4720187 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4720188 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4720189 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4720190 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4720191 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4720192 who are open to doing something on the production side
4720193 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4720194 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4720195 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4720196 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4720197 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4720198 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4720199 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4720200 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4720201 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4720202 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4720203 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4720204 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4720205 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4720206 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4720207 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4720208 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4720209 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4720210 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4720211 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4720212 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4720213 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4720214 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4720215 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4720216 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4720217 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4720218 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4720219 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4720220 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4720221 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4720222 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4720223 players can take on the role of a male or a female and choose who they want to fall in love and start a family with
4720224 gamers can also test their farming skills against each other and compete for prizes via the nintendo wi fi connection
4720225 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4720226 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4720227 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4720228 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4720245 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4720246 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4720247 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4720248 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4720249 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4720301 is sin falling apart from god the main reason for all these time wasting unproductive activities its as if man is trying to occupy its mind heart and soul all the time so he doesnt have to think about god but then how will man know good if there is no evil in the world for us to compare with
4720302 sex video von gina lisa wie lauter linkhuren dar ber bloggen blo um viele besucher und trackbacks zu bekommen
4720303 how do we know the difference between you and those that are trying to kill us
4720304 going in here i was really confident about my shooting my shooting was really good i missed that target and it made me more determined
4720305 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4720306 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4720307 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4720308 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4720309 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4720310 i did not even know what it was all about
4720311 for the last month i have been training all alone
4720312 i know some of my teammates have fallen ill and it just happened that they couldnt make it here
4720313 im not sure whats going on i barely saw any of my teammates before i came so i dont know anything about it
4720314 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
4720315 obviously the others had more experience than i have me but i was fortunate today i do feel lucky
4720316 i want to thank god for the opportunity to be in five olympic games and to end my career like this
4720317 silver is not bad but silver is silver sometimes i heard an athlete say silver tasted like gold but to me silver is silver and bronze is bronze
4720318 its an issue probably an issue in one country we know what country
4720319 i guess theyre trying to do the best they can the testers youve just got to hope for the best for the people that are clean
4720320 it was strange maybe they were dodging it a bit because theyre under a bit of pressure with the accusations that have been going around
4720321 i wondered what i was going to say at this monumental time when it would happen and who i would say it to and of course i thought i was going to say it to you phelps for some time now
4720322 the word comes to mind epic what you did tonight was epic i never thought for one moment you were out of that race you represent such an inspiration to youngsters around the world
4720323 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4720324 and that was the difference cause if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed
4720325 its from the u s its foreign to them my god the whole game is foreign to them
4720326 murray cook the guy who did this is a genius
4720327 its amazing what he can do you had to see this place back in january
4720328 in the states we can build a field in a month here it takes three or four months
4720329 nothing was there its hard to describe virtually none of this was in working order its just incredible
4720330 he had some help obviously murray is not simply a guy who directs people hes a hands on guy he gets out there with a hose he drives the grass cutters this place is a thousand times better than it was
4720331 a slow boat it got here the day of the first practice 35 tons
4720332 murray cook the guy who did this is a genius
4720333 in the states we can build a field in a month here it takes three or four months
4720334 nothing was there its hard to describe virtually none of this was in working order its just incredible
4720335 he had some help obviously murray is not simply a guy who directs people hes a hands on guy he gets out there with a hose he drives the grass cutters this place is a thousand times better than it was
4720336 a slow boat it got here the day of the first practice 35 tons
4720337 i came home and it just didnt seem right i kind of felt like the easy and selfish way out would be to abandon jill when it was most critical for her
4720338 weve been together then she left and she came back just to help me prepare thats real strong character right there ive been getting all the attention it all slipped out of her hands at the last minute and its been hard for both of us
4720339 its an individual sport its not a team sport its every man for himself and thats the way the sport was designed
4720340 i think both of us were a little bit apprehensive about what to expect but at the end of the day we learned to like each other wed make bets for ice cream things like that and at the end of the day we just had fun
4720341 im not going to tell you that women are buying themselves lipstick to feel better because they cant buy gas
4720342 but the strength of the sales growth is pretty clear this is a resilient category worldwide
4720343 ive set an arbitrary aggressive target of 25 per cent cost out of the supply chain
4720344 it means between us we have to find ways to improve our supply chain operations
4720345 much of which is driven by what we at chrysler do how we act drives your cost
4720346 there has been a decision there is a first collective agreement for gatineau for the garage
4720347 the market is growing so quickly that theres a lot of room for people to be misinformed
4720348 its a phenomenal number especially if you keep in mind that its only for retrofits and only retrofits that have applied for government incentives
4720349 in canada the standards put in place are more stringent than anywhere else in the world
4720350 canadian sales were up 119 per cent versus the same quarter last year
4720351 ontario has grown the most its up 200 per cent
4720352 hugely hugely carried away with the momentum to the upside
4720353 i dont think the time was anywhere near right to see 145 u s a barrel oil so the retracement to 110 to 115 doesnt surprise me in the least and i wouldnt be at all surprised if we saw it back at 85 or 90 in pretty short order
4720354 the data seems to have had a pretty profound impact on the canadian dollar the currency is really rallying in stark contrast to the trend weve seen over the last few weeks
4720355 i have to say im a little bit surprised that its managed to completely outweigh the softness in commodity prices but it simply seems that some days commodity prices dont win
4720356 i was quite impressed by the way the growth was going and the way the indian government is approaching the non resident indians and foreigners
4720357 you dont feel very congested like compared to before it is just like you are walking into any western country
4720358 we are doing our own development we are building 97 bungalows
4720359 ive decided that when the canadian real estate market picks up i will bail out and bring the money here again
4720360 i know a few canadians who have retired get their pensions who actually prefer to live in india because the canadian dollar travels much further in india than it does here
4720361 we do plan to host another expo in canada perhaps in toronto and in vancouver later this year
4720362 with investors across markets snooping around for new assets indian properties became the red hot blue chip it has certainly priced out genuine home buyers from the market
4720363 studio production has decreased in popularity and as a result cinevillage is very underutilized
4720364 in addition canwest owns and operates existing studio space that can be used for production of this nature
4720365 we are disappointed that canwest will not be renewing its lease for its television production facility in our heward campus
4720366 however this studio campus is extremely well liked by film and television personnel and we will now be able to offer more production space in addition to the new facilities at filmport
4720367 must more and more produce product with their own resources and at their own risk in the hope of finding sales if the show doesnt get the ratings it is cut loose and the freelance producer is the big loser
4720368 i said i did not want to sign anything and be locked in and he said please sign so we can call you
4720369 we do not tolerate dishonest or misleading behaviour by our sales agents
4720370 when a customer enrols in a contract we need to start purchasing the commodity right away so we can deliver at the price we promised for the duration of the contract
4720371 its hard for customers to understand how the penalties are so high just weeks after they sign and reaffirm a contract and before they get anything
4720372 weve been just as concerned about the confusion in the marketplace
4720373 people who speak more languages are likely to find employment easier than those who dont speak a second language
4720374 in todays business its easier to close business deals when you speak to a person in their own language youre more culturally sensitive to various business aspects too
4720375 depending on the business when you benefit the company in the long run by enhancing their mobility youll notice youre advancing in your career path too
4720376 by 2009 there will be a shortage of canadian workers who can speak french
4720377 so because you can speak french you will be an asset to your company and you will make more than others
4720378 and these are just positions for students were not even talking about permanent positions
4720379 we are very fortunate in toronto because we have french language channels chinese channels spanish channels and we have neighbours and co workers who speak other languages
4720380 english is our first language in canada so any new immigrant would benefit from learning how to communicate clearly and concisely in english
4720381 children are our future and i cant imagine any more effort thats as integral to society and our judicial system
4720382 its never been on the radar screen its something thats been in the back room or the cellar
4720383 dependency cases represent the most intrusive form of governmental intervention
4720384 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4720385 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4720386 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4720387 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4720388 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4720389 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4720390 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4720391 thank god the situation is under control we havent observed any security violations people are happy and cooperating with security forces
4720392 es ist mir bekannt dass fr her captagon genommen worden ist viele spieler waren verr ckt danach
4720393 das war berall bekannt und wurde praktiziert bis zu 50 prozent haben das konsumiert nicht nur in der zweiten liga
4720394 wir haben einen brief an herrn neururer geschrieben und ihn freundlich gebeten namen und fakten zu nennen
4720395 da macht sich einer wichtig f r mich kann ich total ausschlie en das bei mir so etwas passiert ist ich kann aber nicht beurteilen was bei anderen war
4720396 auf schalke habe ich das 1989 90 auch mitbekommen die damaligen spieler von schalke 04 kamen ja fast alle aus der bundesliga in die zweite liga
4720397 ich habe immer aus normaler kraft meine leistung gebracht mal besser mal schlechter
4720398 ich habe nie solche mittel genommen und auch nicht mitbekommen dass es andere machten
4720399 durch stimulanzien kann man vielleicht schneller laufen aber man wird kein besserer fu baller das ist quatsch
4720400 man sieht den spielern den konsum von captagon an die augen stehen anders der spieler wird nicht mehr m de und neigt auf dem platz zu berreaktionen das war ein kompletter wahnsinn der da gemacht wurde
4720401 das ein oder andere aufgefallen die spieler waren hochmotiviert und sind gerannt wie wahnsinnig
4720402 da habe ich schon gefragt junge wo hast du die kraft her ich wei nicht ob das an captagon lag
4720403 immer nach mitteln gesucht um die spieler besser zu machen
4720404 wenn er gewusst hat wer das genommen hat h tte er einschreiten k nnen aber er hat sie ja spielen lassen
4720405 mir ist nichts aufgefallen ich habe nichts davon geh rt niemand hat dar ber gesprochen
4720406 aber als pr sident kriegt man das ja nicht mit das zeug kann sich jeder selbst besorgen und einschmei en
4720407 es gab auch andere mittel alle ephedrine die auch von den radfahrern geschluckt werden das sind die asthmamittel pl tzlich hatte jeder asthma um das nehmen zu d rfen auch im nasenspray sind zu 90 prozent ephedrine
4720408 als ich angefangen habe mit 17 oder 18 jahren da habe ich so etwas geh rt einige haben wohl um spielen zu k nnen captagon geschluckt
4720409 wir werden pr fen inwieweit die nada auch f r unsere dopingkontrollen und das kann ja immer nur der trainingsbereich sein besser nutzbar gemacht werden kann
4720410 nicht der finanzier dieser gesellschaft sondern wir haben sportvereine denen wir verpflichtet sind
4720411 man muss keine angst davor haben zu sagen im fu ballsport wird weiterhin gedopt
4720412 the same conditions that were evident in the first half of the year remain relevant as we move into the second half
4720413 builders continue to manage their supply levels as they face higher inventories combined with recent price escalation and strong competition with the resale market
4720414 things just went too far too fast for everybody and what we are seeing now is a reality check for everybody
4720415 for those of us who have been around since the early 1980s weve seen these cycles before and well see them again
4720416 we have a strong well managed industry and well survive

4720568 the ied was kept beside the road where a regular police checking is set from many years the blast happened just in front of the assam police checking camp but it claims no injury as that time there was no jawan at the place
4720569 they were giving a strict vigilance in the last few days before the independence day but just it passed with no miscreants the roads seemed deserted with no security or patrolling and the militants might have taken the chance to make it possible

4720586 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4720587 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4720588 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4720589 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4720590 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4720591 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4720592 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4720606 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4720607 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4720608 in my time as a member of parliament i have never seen an act so selfish of that by alan carpenter

4720615 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4720616 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4720617 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4720618 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4720619 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4720620 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4720621 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4720622 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4720623 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4720624 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community

4720628 if the present growth trends in world population industrialization pollution food production and resource depletion continue unchanged the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity
4720629 it is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future the state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential
4720630 the overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth rate loop is a recent phenomenon a result of mankinds very successful reduction of worldwide mortality the controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint there are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new lower death rate or the death rate must rise again
4720631 the result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985 with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food industrial output and services per person eventually however resource shortages reduce industrial output and the temporarily stable state degenerates
4720632 man possesses for a small moment in his history the most powerful combination of knowledge tools and resources the world has ever known he has all that is physically necessary to create a totally new form of human society one that would be built to last for generations the two missing ingredients are a realistic long term goal that can guide mankind to the equilibrium society and the human will to achieve that goal
4720633 without such a goal and a commitment to it short term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and
4720634 in the same way that shamans and sooth sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers they would use a natural phenomenon as their enemy to achieve their objectives
4720635 at current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years
4720636 gaia our mother who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution is dying
4720637 a small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for earth
4720638 a radical change from the current trajectory is required a complete reordering of global society
4720639 humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy
4720640 at this time a new enemy must be found one either real or invented for the purpose
4720641 democracy has failed us a new system of global governance based on environmental imperatives must be implemented quickly
4720642 a massive campaign must be launched to de develop the
4720643 the prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet
4720644 my three main goals would be to reduce human population to about 100 million worldwide destroy the industrial infrastructure and see wilderness with its full complement of species returning throughout the world
4720645 if you are not willing to accept my offer i see we have little more to discuss
4720646 i think thats extremely harsh to someone in my situation

4720658 in the process of backing up they struck the boy
4720659 he was partially trapped until the car accelerated forward and struck two parked cars
4720660 this is the last alarm for district chief bob leek
4720661 he kissed his wife goodbye and said bobby to the rescue and he was off
4720662 he wanted to be of service to all he wanted to make everyone feel good
4720663 but most of all we want to thank the people of toronto
4720664 we all know a firefighters job is to go where no one else will
4720665 he did more than his job or any other job requires
4720666 we all owe him a huge debt of gratitude we can never repay
4720667 the painful thing here is that bob had one on one contact with so much of the organization
4720668 his death was the toughest part of sunday in many respects
4720669 i got a bunch of letters from one person to another person about information they were sending back and forth but i never got the information they were sending
4720670 may refuse to disclose a record that is a report prepared in the course of law enforcement inspections or investigations
4720671 both the police and community groups see value in the directors report being available to the public
4720672 as the interview you seek directly relates to matters the ombudsmans office is investigating out of deference to the ombudsmans process it would be inappropriate for me to comment on these matters
4720673 you cant measure the quality of the organization or its institutional progress by the number of charges its laying per se
4720674 thats not a fair way to measure on the other hand extremes do tell a story
4720675 for years to have gone by without a charge being laid under the directorship of cornish its probably an indicator that we ought to be asking more questions
4720676 the allegations contained in the statement of claim have not been proven and a statement of defence will be filed
4720677 i know that there is no way based on the information they gave me theres no way that any sane logical person would see that that makes sense
4720678 there is a tendency on police services when investigating police to be very sparse with information
4720679 what was expected to be a major advance in transparency and accountability has fallen flat in regards to families getting information
4720680 it has always been the expectation that the recommendations in the adams report would be fulfilled and one of the hallmark recommendations was the sharing of the siu reports
4720681 there is simply no excuse for this to have not been done
4720682 there is an issue of public perception as to the partiality or impartiality in terms of these investigations and whether or not the police officer is being treated in a similar fashion as a member of the public would
4720683 there is a need i think as a matter of policy for greater transparency saying what the decision was if its to prosecute its clear in court if its not to prosecute why
4720684 i think thats just a reflection of the evolving public expectations the public cynicism about public institutions is higher now its more cynical now and for that i think we collectively have a responsibility to look at how we do business and make greater efforts to be transparent if we can
4720685 they did tell me that within eight seconds of him going through to the checkout to the time he went past the magazine stands and into the exit door he was shot
4720686 we hope people understand there will be a great deal of professionals in the area and they need to be given all the room and clearance they can to get on with the work and complete it as soon as possible
4720687 the ministrys order is still that sunrise propane is responsible for this how that will be complied with remains to be seen
4720688 thats what we expected but we just didnt have the data thursday
4720689 all of the levels we got even on the workers removing the asbestos was below that the clearance level of 01 by a factor of five or 10
4720690 we promised the public thursday night that wed put them up and so we put them up
4720691 the health effects usually occur when people are exposed to high levels of asbestos over a long period of time were talking years
4720692 i do feel a little more american than russian but im very proud of my russian heritage and of being russian liukin said with gold around her neck
4720693 give us your swift your strong your huddled athletes longing to be olympians
4720694 in my family at home we watch the olympics all the time and sure we want the canadians to do well
4720695 you order a pizza while youre watching the olympics and you pay 15 or 20 bucks whatever that feeds you but it also makes it more enjoyable to watch the games when somebody wins a gold medal isnt that worth 20 bucks in enjoyment
4720696 we complain that we shouldnt spend money on sports but then we complain that we havent done well in sports and its because we havent spent the money
4720697 when silken laumann marnie mcbean and derek porter performed so well many of our kids were inspired by their success and took up rowing
4720698 some of those kids made it to the olympics others didnt
4720699 but every one of those kids benefited from learning dedication hard work teamwork and is a better person because of it
4720700 we need to put resouces into our olympians being a connected p r arm of health and welfare make it cool and desired to be fit
4720701 the medals will be a byproduct our marketing arm otherwise we spend more and more dollars on sick people both young and old
4720702 kids are going to be diving into the swimming pool and trying to do the breaststroke or figure out the butterfly running and jumping in parks fencing with anything they could find
4720703 my friend was camping with her daughter and she was in the water saying look mommy im rowing im not saying shes going to row at the olympics it is more than that its an inspiration from top to bottom
4720704 i think we need to keep supporting these athletes not just next week but the next four years in terms of giving the support thats required if we want to beat the world
4720705 otherwise dont come here and expect that all of a sudden for two weeks were going to beat the world when theres an amazing amount of support put out there financially by other nations we cant stop weve got to keep running
4720706 sport organizations are often the last refuge of the incompetent
4720707 i have read many of margaret atwoods books and im proud of her accomplishments but ive never jumped up and down on a couch when i heard margaret atwood wrote another book or michael ondaatje won a great literary award
4720708 i think weve moved forward to a time that the governor general also should have a sport award in the same way they honour arts and literature
4720709 i guess it goes to selling the message why sport is important
4720710 i just think its such an intricate part of society i look at my kids coming back from a workout and i see the jubiliation and feel the optimism that they have
4720711 maybe we need to spread that message more clearly promote the benefits of sport to society as well some countries understand it but i think canada sometimes grapples with it theres a perception that youre just funding the elite a small percentage but i think it benefits the whole society
4720712 but its a different story with summer athletes right now
4720713 i see it because i used to be a cyclist i know what its like
4720714 there is a lot of sponsorship money going into vanoc vancouver organizing committeee and into the coc right now but theres a void theres not money going into the athletes pocket
4720715 its a way of connecting to an olympic athletes journey
4720716 its an amazing ride ive brought people along on the ride many times it really is something special i think thats a part that is really missing in canada
4720717 the origins of the conflagration in june in kashmir on forest land allocation for construction of facilities for the amarnath yatra lie in open state promotion of the pilgrimage the yatra has caused considerable damage to the economy and ecology of the area the high handed actions of the shri amarnath shrine board only aggravated the situation
4720718 the sasb runs a virtually parallel administration and acts as a sovereign body promoting hindu interests increasing the number of pilgrims from 12 000 in 1989 to over 400 000 in 2007 and extending the period of the pilgrimage from 15 days to two and half months
4720719 such a conflagration undermines the unity and integrity of india
4720720 muslims looking for land to set up cemetery near helsinki
4720721 the aim is to find a larger area as a long term solution
4720722 burial legislation requires that we indicate a grave plot for helsinki residents
4720723 ten years from now the situation will be more acute
4720724 as much as this show was not a good thing it brought the imams together
4720725 father zakaria is fueled by desperation but no one should be condemned by other peoples faith
4720726 and we would do the same thing if someone comes out demonizing jesus or denying the holocaust
4720727 i am pretty comfortable with where we are at the final scorecard will come tomorrow afternoon
4720728 theres about 25 of them theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne

4720730 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii
4720731 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4720732 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4720733 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4720734 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4720735 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4720736 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4720737 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4720738 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4720739 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4720740 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4720741 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4720742 i pray to linda i pray for her soul every day
4720743 i also pray that one day you and your family will be forgiving also im so sorry

4720752 la mal llamada libertad de comercio es una libertad que enjaula y una gran mentira porque es el nombre que el norte del mundo da a todo lo que no practica pero es todo lo que predica y como el paraguay de los l pez cometi el grave pecado de proteger sus propios productos e impedir el paso de la avalancha de los productos brit nicos y no se at al cuello la soga de la deuda externa que nos ahorca fue castigado

4720768 music has always been an integral part of the canadian forces and the musical salute is one way that we can thank canadians for their continued support
4720769 we invite everyone down to the cne at 7 tonight so we can personally thank all those who have supported the brave men and women
4720770 i am afraid that crude and simplistic categorisation especially ones that end up with a level five higher state of people and communities deserve vigourous criticism i have seen more people damaged by this type of approach in too many organisations to be able to tolerate it
4720771 he also has a worrying tendency along with many other popular management writers in the us to offer fixed recipes that allegedly cover every situation this makes it easy for the reader to digest and gives them to confidence to apply the advice but life isnt always that simple for example the weakest chapter of the leaders guide to storytelling is the chapter on innovation storytelling gets advanced as pretty much the only way of advancing innovation within organisations and it all gets a little silly
4720772 this land is the biggest symbol of our secularism dividing people in the name of faith will not solve these problems

4720775 i guess she got all excited when i walked in because i was a familiar face she got a little bit over friendly when i realised she had feelings for me i knocked it on the head
4720776 i knew from the moment i went in producers would want me to be paired off with someone
4720777 jen was very sweet and we clicked i found it easy to talk to her because she had a young daughter too however i soon realised i had walked into a love triangle i didnt want to cause rows

4720782 i always talk to my mum about the roles i play because its wonderful to talk to another actor that you speak the same language with and ask questions
4720783 the periods of time have passed now when i wouldnt take her advice or i would disagree with her
4720784 i would still obviously want to respect my mother but also im my own person and i take my work very seriously
4720785 so there were moments in the beginning which were a little awkward but shes got her own career ive got my own career and were always just so happy to be able to talk to each other about certain things and be a sounding board
4720786 we have arrested more than eight people in connection with the serial bomb blasts in ahmedabad

4720790 i understand why they arent supporting vsts and i see a future where j2ee developers are using rational borland products and net developers are using vsts if rational doesnt get their pricing down its going to drive j2ee developers to net simply based on cost
4720791 and despite akimbos claim to be the first digital quality video on demand service over the internet the video quality is erratic none of it is high definition none of it looks as good as a dvd and some of it has the blockiness and pixellation of a web cam one childrens series is so obviously a transfer from a vhs cassette you can actually see the white streaks of the vcrs dirty heads

4720801 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4720802 for the most part these people have done their time
4720803 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4720804 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4720805 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4720806 were challenging politicians who say theyre christian but have voted 100 percent for late term abortions and partial birth abortions
4720807 i dont want to be courted by his christianity or his charisma but by his voting record

4720809 if senator mccain chooses a pro abortion vice president hell give the election to obama
4720810 he will have muddied the water and itd be tantamount to political suicide
4720811 someone who connects with pro life issues and is not afraid to talk about them
4720812 weve lost our spiritual roots weve been afraid to talk about them
4720813 the commitment to life among young evangelicals exceeds that of their parents
4720814 our purpose in gathering this weekend is not political at all
4720815 its about life and death about the next generation and whether there will be one if we make it ok for a society to slaughter innocent or vulnerable life people will treat us the same way
4720816 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4720817 if fire should move in naturally were comfortable with that
4720818 but if you bring a drip torch into the vatican and intend to ignite it you are going to have some opposition
4720819 the link with the protection of peoples health and safety is at least very doubtful
4720820 the european directive is wrong and its czech version is even worse so i cannot sign the law
4720821 we need a candidate with a coherent and comprehensive view of the world and that includes mccains vice presidential candidate why doesnt he care about what the conservatives want if we dont pressure him he will do whatever and choose whomever he wants
4720822 they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights

4720825 ooooh stop whining i dont understand why are you such a teachers pet at school but a monster at home sometimes cant you just pretend you are at school now

4720827 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4720828 an actual discovery of these wrecks would offer unprecedented information on the exploration of canadas north and the discovery of the northwest passage a critical piece of our shared history and important to present and future generations
4720829 uniformed and plainclothes police are hanging around to keep public order mainly but they are also watching us

4720845 sinds ik begin jaren tachtig politiek actief werd heb ik me altijd verantwoord voor mijn acties ik heb altijd geweten dat verantwoorden kwetsbaar maakt toch heb ik nooit de keuze gemaakt om mijn mond te houden de wijnand duyvendak uit de jaren tachtig is een andere wijnand dan degene die hier nu zit er zit een belangrijke overgang van soms ook illegale acties naar het be nvloeden van parlementaire besluitvorming via maatschappelijke acties die burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid zo nodig niet schuwen ik dacht het moet echt anders en koos toen zeer bewust voor de parlementaire weg ondersteund door acties
4720846 we leven in een gemeenschap waarin we onze conflicten op een fatsoenlijke manier proberen te beslechten hier in het parlement moet het verschil gemaakt worden
4720847 dinsdagavond werd ik geconfronteerd met een nieuw gegeven waar ik me rot van schrok per e mail kreeg ik een open brief waarin een oud topambtenaar van ez me schreef over bedreigingen die hij en zijn gezin hadden gekregen naar aanleiding van publicaties in het blad bluf het nrc publiceerde daarover vandaag tot deze week heb ik daar niets van geweten en ik heb er wellicht ten overvloede ook geen enkele betrokkenheid bij gehad
4720848 zeker gezien dit nieuwe feit word ik in de beeldvorming nog sterker de jaren tachtig ingezogen dat is een beeld waarin ik me niet herken ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik me beter kan verdedigen als ik mijn functie van kamerlid neerleg dan heb ik mijn handen vrij om me te verzetten tegen een beeld waar ik me ontzettend ongelukkig bij voel
4720849 ik hoop uit de grond van mijn hart dat mijn bijdrage aan de verantwoording ook bij anderen zal leiden tot reflectie en verantwoording
4720850 in mijn boek dat woensdag wordt gepresenteerd concludeer ik dat in de strijd tegen de klimaatverandering twee dingen nodig zijn politici met het lef om de benodigde maatregelen te nemen n mensen die bouwen aan een grote open klimaatbeweging die werkt binnen de grenzen van de wet langs die weg wil ik me de komende jaren keihard blijven inzetten
4720851 ik begrijp dat wijnand in het licht van de gewijzigde omstandigheden tot zijn besluit is gekomen maar ik betreur het ook heel erg
4720852 vorige week heb ik de inbraak uit 1985 hard veroordeeld ik had ook kritiek op de manier waarop hij het naar buiten heeft gebracht wij hebben wijnand toen de ruimte gegeven om te werken aan herstel van zijn geloofwaardigheid ik betreur het heel erg dat hij die ruimte binnen zijn werk als kamerlid nu niet meer ziet
4720853 wijnand is altijd open geweest en heeft zelf informatie aangedragen over zijn activiteiten in het verleden zijn bereidheid tot verantwoording is uitzonderlijk dat mensen zich verantwoorden over het verleden vind ik van groot belang dan moet er echter wel publieke ruimte zijn om te erkennen dat mensen veranderen en zich ontwikkelen en die ruimte heb ik de afgelopen weken weleens gemist
4720854 de fractie van groenlinks de partij en ik zullen wijnand enorm missen als deskundig en betrokken kamerlid een competente en integere collega en een democraat in hart en nieren en een onge venaarde kenner van de mondiale klimaatproblemen en de oplossingen daarvoor
4720855 ik zal hem persoonlijk missen en het is een grote aderlating voor mijn partij

4720860 lo sciopero degli sceneggiatori offriva spazi liberi in estate periodo perfetto per i film per famiglie
4720861 siamo assolutamente entusiasti del lavoro fatto da yates e dal cast e proprio per questo pensiamo di dover fornire il massimo nella fase di postproduzione non vorremmo infatti che per accelerare i tempi dopo aver subito le conseguenze dello sciopero degli sceneggiatori ed essere partiti in ritardo non offrissimo un prodotto degno dellamore che i fan hanno espresso verso la serie in questi anni siamo ovviamente spiacenti dellulteriore attesa che dovranno subire ma ci sentiremmo di tradire la loro fiducia se nel presentare il nuovo film non fornissimo loro quello che si meritano e ci preoccupassimo soltanto di questioni commerciali
4720862 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4720864 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4720865 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4720866 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4720867 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4720868 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4720871 there is a large gap between the multiple skills demanded from the employer required to remain globally competitive and the skills learnt in educational institutions this industry academia mismatch is one of the affects of globalisation that gives opportunities for document abuse which is seriously manipulated amp misused towards the outward migration of indian knowledge capital as well
4720872 every industry has a small lot of not so right people and the recruiting industry is no exception nostops has been striving hard to set right this malady through this initiative we hope to begin making the difference to our members by providing them an opportunity to do the right thing and to be sought by the employers rather than beating the system or by opting for services from little known agencies people wherein monitoring quality service from them will be very difficult

4720876 daarvoor is er al te veel tegenslag geweest eerst zien dan geloven toch heb ik er alle vertrouwen in omdat er ondanks alles steeds weer vooruitgang te zien was we zijn bezig met iets nieuws en dan weet je dat het risicos met zich meebrengt en het langer kan duren

4720886 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4720887 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4720888 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4720896 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4720897 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4720898 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4720899 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4720900 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4720901 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4720902 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4720911 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4720913 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4720914 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4720915 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4720916 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4720917 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4720918 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4720919 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4720920 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4720921 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4720922 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4720923 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4720924 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4720925 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4720926 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4720927 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4720928 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4720929 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo

4720931 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4720932 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4720933 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4720934 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4720935 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4720936 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4720937 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4720938 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4720939 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4720940 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4720941 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4720942 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4720943 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4720944 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4720945 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4720946 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4720947 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4720948 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4720949 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4720950 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4720951 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4720952 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4720953 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4720954 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4720955 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4720956 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4720957 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4720958 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4720959 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4720960 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4720961 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4720962 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4720963 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4720964 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4720965 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4720966 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4720967 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4720968 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4720969 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4720970 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4720971 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4720972 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4720973 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4720974 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4720975 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4720976 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4720977 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4720978 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4720979 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4720980 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4720981 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4720982 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4720983 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4720984 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4720985 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4720986 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4720987 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4720988 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4720989 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4720990 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4720991 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4720992 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4720993 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4720994 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4720995 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4720996 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4720997 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4720998 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4720999 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4721000 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4721001 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4721002 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4721003 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4721004 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4721005 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4721006 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4721007 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4721398 i came home and it just didnt seem right i kind of felt like the easy and selfish way out would be to abandon jill when it was most critical for her
4721399 weve been together then she left and she came back just to help me prepare thats real strong character right there ive been getting all the attention it all slipped out of her hands at the last minute and its been hard for both of us
4721400 its an individual sport its not a team sport its every man for himself and thats the way the sport was designed

4721402 vous n tes pas tr s people mais depuis quelques mois vous affichez votre relation avec 2007
4721403 en juillet dernier elle avait demand me rencontrer par linterm diaire de mon agent
4721404 je croyais quelle avait juste envie de faire ma connaissance alors quen fait elle avait flash sur moi
4721405 you are heroes not only to the armed forces of the philippines but also to the filipino nation
4721406 i am here greeting you for a job well done i hope you get well soon let us continue doing our jobs
4721407 i knew i had to be within half a bodylength at the turn
4721408 i race against crocker all the time he has front half speed if i had half a bodylength i knew i would be fine when i saw crocker at the turn i knew cavic would be somewhere with him i could sort of see him out of the corner of my eye
4721409 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision it turned out to be in my favor
4721410 when people say things about that it just fires me up
4721411 it was like the 400 free relay one of the french swimmers alain bernard said something to get us going we use things like that comments like that to fuel us to get us even more excited thats what americans do we rise to the occasion when bob first told me that i said okay were going to let our swimming do the talking ill always welcome comments like that anyone who wants to say something i like it it definitely motivates me
4721412 simply other worldly when you see his arms flapping on the starting blocks it really gets your heart racing
4721413 i cant believe im crying and its the american national anthem
4721414 they were playing as well as anyone here to beat them i think upstairs is where these guys have needed to improve the most over the last couple of years theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing they honestly can win this thing its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4721415 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4721416 we came into this tournament and knew we had the capabilities of beating everyone
4721417 this really showed that that game against serbia was a fluke and were a gold medal contention team
4721418 us and serbia are a bit better than the u s a
4721419 they probably will be the third team in our group
4721420 we have to celebrate for five minutes and get ourselves ready for monday
4721421 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4721422 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4721423 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4721424 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4721425 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4721426 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4721427 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4721428 they couldnt believe phelps got there and im sure ill feel the same way
4721429 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4721430 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4721431 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4721432 if we got to do this again i would win it

4721519 im not having this move my rubbish and ill move my car
4721520 a guy in a shirt and tie appeared and said that to teach us a lesson they were not going to empty the bins in the street
4721521 finally one of the men said they would clear the rubbish if we moved so we did and they kept to their word
4721522 we pay 144 a month in council tax for them to strike when they feel like it and then not to collect our rubbish was just not on

4721530 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4721531 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4721532 baa gatwick is disappointed to learn that the trade unions representing some swissport employees have voted for strike action later this month
4721533 baa gatwick is working closely with the handling agent and the airlines it represents to minimise the potential impact on passengers planning to travel on the proposed strike dates
4721534 a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4721535 gmb members cannot afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4721536 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises

4721539 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4721540 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4721541 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4721542 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4721543 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4721544 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4721545 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4721546 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4721561 when we took ownership two years ago parties would come in for a drink in the afternoon with all these pheasants in the back of their cars so one day we said wed take some off their hands and put a tab behind the bar for them it has grown from that
4721562 just recently it has become very popular possibly because of the credit crunch and its great for us because we know everything is fresh

4721616 it was 3am on thursday when i heard a bang then the man from room four shouted down saying somebody had been shooting at him through his window
4721617 there are six holes in the window really big holes so it was obviously a powerful rifle
4721618 we think the shots were fired from a car park across the road the a596
4721619 i rang them back at 10am and they said that theyd tried to call me but the phone was engaged
4721620 you could understand it if this had been a minor incident
4721621 im appalled at the lack of police response any incident involving guns has to be considered serious and deserving of an emergency response

4721625 three and a half years into my recovery i was thrilled to discover that i was pregnant dana and i celebrated the final restoration of every good thing we had lost to the illness but faced with another baby a daughter i knew i had some other kinds of healing to do i finally began the journey inside i started writing my story in the pages of my life i saw the transformation of life and the redefinition of mental illness it has been twelve years since my dad and david hardy discovered the supplement empowerplus sold through a canadian company truehope nutritional support and produced in the united states empowerplus has led to the recovery of thousands of people like me with diagnosis ranging from bipolar to depression to anxiety and add in spite of the interest of excellent university researchers several published studies and ongoing double blind studies as well as the claims of over ten thousand north americans who have benefited by the use of the supplement virulent bureaucratic opposition has been raised in canada to try to force empowerplus users back to standard drug therapies it is the fight for the right to choose a non drug treatment that has formed my new lifes path and my public life in 2003 in a press conference on canadas parliament hill i claimed that mine was the new face of mental illness not an illustrious claim but a hopeful one it is my hope that this story is told and as others enjoy the benefits of my fathers very personal miracle there will be a new face of mental illness that the stigma of degradation and embarrassment will turn to one of acceptance and that others will know what i know that a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is not a death sentence nor is it a life sentence there are answers there is healing and everyone who suffers has a right to know about and choose the treatments that work for them

4721660 el cerebro es una red pero de acuerdo a mi opini n muy personal esa perspectiva no ha recibido la atenci n que se merece en la neurociencia
4721661 la mayor a de los investigadores creen que el cerebro es un conjunto de m dulos aislados pero todas y cada una de sus partes dependen de las otras partes para su interconexi n
4721662 afecciones tales como el mal de alzheimer y el autismo han sido asociadas a perturbaciones de fibras en el cerebro
4721663 las fibras nerviosas son como delgados alambres envueltos en una capa de grasa llamada mielina
4721664 el agua suele diseminarse no a trav s de esas fibras sino a lo largo de ellas eso se debe a que el agua y la grasa no se combinan con facilidad
4721665 si usted somete a una persona a una tomograf a y no le pregunta nada el cerebro pese a ello seguir activo tan activo como cuando usted hace algo
4721666 lo que se ala este bello ensayo es que no solo hay comunicaci n dentro de los sistemas sino tambi n entre sistemas
4721667 el conectomo es algo deseable de tener pero sin una base estructural es como flotar en el aire necesitamos esa base
4721668 necesitamos prestar m s atenci n a los cerebros individuales
4721669 en el pasado la mayor a de los estudios alud an a un cerebro est ndar o a promedios de grupo
4721670 mi corazonada es que la conexi n est vinculada con la funci n y que la conexi n podr a ayudar a pronosticar y explicar las variaciones individuales que vemos en el desempe o cognitivo inclusive de cerebros sanos

4721686 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4721687 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
4721688 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light

4721694 die zeittrainings waren recht schwierig f r mich da wir hier nicht testen konnten aber es ist uns gelungen das fahrzeug von gestern auf heute zu verbessern in meinem ersten stint war ich noch nicht zufrieden wir haben in der box kleinere nderungen vorgenommen und es lief sofort besser das erste rennen hoffe ich in den top f nf beenden zu k nnen im zweiten sollte das podium drin sein

4721705 i am the lord your god you shall have no other gods before me
4721706 okay okay i realize im not perfect but im certainly not as bad as the next guy and after all isnt god loving and forgiving
4721707 you shall not make for yourself any idols you shall not bow down and worship them
4721708 well im okay with this one after all i dont worship pagan gods or totem poles
4721709 by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
4721710 in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind
4721711 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
4721712 for all of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment and all of us wither like a leaf and our iniquities like the wind take us away
4721713 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your god and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear
4721714 the lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and he reserves wrath for his enemies
4721715 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
4721716 you say i am innocent surely his anger has turned from me
4721717 it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment
4721718 because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god
4721719 it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living god
4721720 the son of man will send forth his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit lawlessness and will cast them into the furnace of fire in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
4721721 behold you are nothing and your work is less than nothing an abomination is he who chooses you
4721722 behold they are all a delusion their works are nothing their metal images are empty wind
4721723 behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights
4721724 for in him christ all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross
4721725 you god made alive together with him christ having forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands this he set aside nailing it to the cross
4721726 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased
4721727 the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them has light shined
4721728 the lord sets the prisoners free the lord opens the eyes of the blind notice that in the latter verse the lord is explicitly mentioned as the liberator of captives and the opener of blind eyes providing evidence that jesus christ is god
4721729 behold the former things have come to pass and new things i now declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
4721730 tell us the former things that we may know their outcome or declare to us the things to come tell us what is to come hereafter that we may know that you are gods
4721731 let them give glory to the lord and declare his praise in the coastlands
4721732 i will lead the blind in a way that they do not know i will turn the darkness before them into light i do not forsake them
4721733 i will make of you a great nation and i will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
4721734 was it not the lord against whom we have sinned
4721735 so he poured on him the heat of his anger and the might of battle it set him on fire all around but he did not understand it burned him up but he did not take it to heart
4721736 be silent all flesh before the lord for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling
4721737 stirred up from the east whom victory meets at every step
4721738 he tramples kings underfoot he makes them like dust with his sword
4721739 i form light and create darkness i make well being and create calamity i am the lord who does all these things
4721740 in those days people will seek death and will not find it they will long to die but death will flee from them
4721741 but you israel my servant jacob whom i have chosen
4721742 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him
4721743 i am a worm and not a man scorned by mankind and despised by the people all who see me mock me they make mouths at me they wag their heads
4721744 that they may see and know may consider and understand together that the hand of the lord has done this the holy one of israel has created it
4721745 tell us the former things or declare to us the things to come hereafter
4721746 do good or do harm that we may be dismayed and terrified
4721747 behold you are nothing and your work is less than nothing an abomination is he who chooses you
4721748 behold they are all a delusion their works are nothing their metal images are empty wind
4721749 all who fashion idols are nothing and the things they delight in do not profit
4721750 their witnesses neither see nor know that they may be put the shame
4721751 you are my witnesses declares the lord and my servant whom i have chosen
4721752 you shall not make for yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them or serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me
4721753 for the lord your god is a consuming fire a jealous god
4721754 it is a fearful thing to fall into the handsof the living god
4721755 they know not nor do they discern for he has shut their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot understand
4721756 a deluded heart has led him astray and he cannot deliver himself or say is there not a lie in my right hand
4721757 you who fear the lord praise him all you offspring of jacob glorify him and stand in awe of him all you offspring of israel
4721758 when rebecca had conceived children by one man our forefather isaac though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad in order that gods purpose of election might continue not because of works but because of his call she was told the older will serve the younger
4721759 what shall we say is there injustice on gods part
4721760 so then he has mercy on whomever he wills and he hardens whomever he wills
4721761 you will say to me then why does he still find fault for who can resist his will
4721762 but who are you o man to answer back to god
4721763 i created the earth and created man on it it was my hands that stretched out the heavens and i commanded all their host
4721764 he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of god in him
4721765 and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved
4721766 jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent and believe in the gospel
4721767 since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our confession for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are
4721768 for our sake he god made him jesus to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
4721769 he committed no sin neither was deceit found in his mouth

4721772 as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes
4721773 the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a participation in the blood of christ the bread that we break is it not a participation in the body of christ
4721774 let a person examine himself then and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup in v11 30 paul revealed that certain members of the local body lost there lives because they did not consider the sanctity of the lords table nor did they apprehend the necessity of self examination
4721775 having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love love one another earnestly from a pure heart
4721776 some argue that the weekly observance of the lords table would erode its distinction causing our practice to be reduced to a numb routine
4721777 der kompromiss den wir eingehen mussten ist ein verlust der breite
4721778 aber wir haben es trotzdem geschafft eine junge mannschaft mit unheimlich viel potenzial aufzubauen
4721779 unser ziel ist ganz klar einen internationalen wettbewerb zu erreichen
4721780 das mit der jugend darf keine ausrede sein im gegenteil durch diese altersstruktur kannst du auch als 23 oder 24 j hriger schon verantwortung bernehmen
4721781 so etwas geht in anderen vereinen vielleicht erst wenn du 28 bist ich finde das hat seinen reiz
4721782 there is none who can deliver from my hand i work and who can turn it back
4721783 you have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings or honored me with your sacrifices
4721784 but you say what a weariness this is and you snort at it says the lord of hosts you bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick and this you bring as your offering shall i accept that from your hand says the lord cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock and vows it and yet sacrifices to the lord what is blemished for i am a great king says the lord of hosts and my name will be feared among the nations
4721785 i i am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake and i will not remember your sins
4721786 set forth your case that you may be proved right
4721787 i will give them a heart to know that i am the lord for they shall return to me with their whole heart
4721788 i will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth they shall be utterly destroyed notice that phrase from the land that i gave to them and their fathers
4721789 all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me i will never cast out
4721790 for i will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground
4721791 i will pour my spirit upon your offspring and my blessing on your descendants
4721792 i i am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake and i will not remember your sins
4721793 this one will say i am the lords another will call on the name of jacob and another will write on his hand the lords and name himself by the name of israel
4721794 set forth your case says the lord bring your proofs says the king of jacob
4721795 i am the first and i am the last besides me there is no god
4721796 let them declare what is to come and what will happen
4721797 tell us what is to come hereafter that we may know that you are gods
4721798 behold the former things have come to pass and new things i now declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
4721799 have i not told you from of old and declared it
4721800 earnestly i seek you my soul thirsts for you my flesh faints for you
4721801 i have looked upon you in the sanctuary beholding your power and glory
4721802 because your steadfast love is better than life my lips will praise you
4721803 my soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food
4721804 in the shadow of your wings i will sing for joy
4721805 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
4721806 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth
4721807 in him all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell
4721808 he is the radiance of the glory of god and the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power
4721809 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
4721810 i am the lord and there is no other besides me there is no god the one forming light and creating darkness causing well being and creating calamity i am the lord who does all these
4721811 no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord i have authority to lay it down and i have authority to take it up again
4721812 the lord was pleased to crush him putting him to grief
4721813 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
4721814 in this is love not that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
4721815 he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross that we might die to sin and live to righteousness for by his wounds you were healed
4721816 god put forward jesus christ as a propitiation by his blood to show gods righteousness
4721817 whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point he has become guilty of all
4721818 he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of god in him
4721819 by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us
4721820 unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and pharisees you will not enter the kingdom of heaven

4721823 i am the lord your god the holy one of israel your savior
4721824 i i am the lord and besides me there is no savior
4721825 i give egypt as your ransom i give men in return for you
4721826 i am the lord your god the holy one of israel your savior
4721827 i give egypt as your ransom i give men in return for you
4721828 because you are precious in my eyes and honored and i love you
4721829 but god being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with christ
4721830 everyone who is called by my name whom i created for my glory whom i formed and made
4721831 i will lead the blind in a way that they do not know in paths that they have not known i will guide them i will turn the darkness before them into light i do not foresake them
4721832 you israel may know and believe me and understand that i am he
4721833 but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for his own possession aligns to v10 that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
4721834 remember not the former things nor consider the things of old

4721931 a scrap of humanity washed up on the soil of the nicu
4721932 we wanted everyone to know he is here as part of a family he has been noticed
4721933 i felt instinctively that i must make a connection to wherever his soul is the image in my mind was that he was somewhere out there real scared and really lost and even if he died that night i needed him to have been touched and named
4721934 jacob had expected warmth succour sweet milk instead there was this frail shell smelling of antiseptic with formula running down a nasogastric tube and needles stuck in tender places
4721935 we have to re educate ourselves as to how not to be passive and helpless in the medical environment how do you reclaim the human dimension in the scientific and medical world science has gone beyond our moral understanding of it
4721936 at the very least every nicu should give parents nursery rhymes to read to their kids

4721939 my mothers a holocaust survivor and no one would discuss what happened
4721940 they were a wild bunch but they quieted right down for campfire stories i was so moved by that we werent talking the iliad it was axe murderers in the forest but its the same thing

4721947 we heard about combining last names in a book so we tried to come up with a name we liked
4721948 even though its a different last name from both of ours it seems to fit the definition of a family name
4721949 they hadnt clued in to the fact that it was a combination of our names
4721950 where parents have any modicum of control they have to exercise it
4721951 it has to be a constant barrage of different ways of penetrating the psyche
4721952 theyll confuse a teen who behaves responsibly otherwise with a good driver but many good teens die in car crashes
4721953 but what they dont have is experience teens think they can handle more situations than they can they even convince themselves
4721954 its on the basis of experience that the brain rewires itself for adulthood

4721964 f r hier f r europa abgesehen vom lido in paris muss ich sagen ist das schon ein hochkar tiger genuss
4721965 also wie es zu der sommer revue selber kam das wei ich ehrlich gesagt auch nicht so richtig da gibt es verschiedene varianten von geschichten auf alle f lle haben die mich angerufen und haben gesagt wir h tten dich gerne dabei und da ich dieses haus sehr sehr mag sehr sch tze hab ich gesagt sofort und ja und wann ich bin da
4721966 dann wenn man die reaktion h rt dann ist man nat rlich gl cklich da kann man so alt werden wie man will der ehrgeiz bleibt und wenn es dann auch noch einigerma en gelungen ist froh bin ich
4721967 ganz ehrlich es erinnert mich ein bisschen an meine kindheit da ich selbst hier im friedrichstadtpalast auch schon aufgetreten bin als kind hinzu kommt noch dass ich gesichter sehe im ballett die ich pers nlich kenne die in meiner staatlichen ballettschule mitgetanzt haben und ja das sch ne ist es ist ja eine sommerliche revue es ist musik deutsche musik die ich also selbst auch kenne und sehr sch tze und eine revue mit viel glitzer und glamour so wie es sich geh rt
4721968 ich genie e es einfach hier zu sein alte rennlegenden zu treffen jochen berger walter r hrl hans joachim stuck war da einfach interessant ich f hl mich sehr sehr wohl
4721969 die problematik die wir heute in deutschland haben ist zum einen mal verunsicherung dass leute nicht wissen was sie kaufen sollen einfach weil auch die politik keine eindeutige aussage macht und zum anderen mal nat rlich auch das vorhandene geld es ist alles teurer geworden und am ende berlegen viele leute ob sie ihr altes auto noch ein paar jahre behalten ich glaube dass das das eigentliche problem ist das problem ist nicht dass die leute kein interesse mehr am automobil haben

4721971 the early church absolutely and completely identified the risen lord of her experience with the earthly jesus of nazareth and created for her purposes which she conceived to be his the literary form of the gospel in which words and deeds ascribed in her consciousness to both the earthly jesus and the risen lord were set down in terms of the former

4721974 but having done that many of them must be wondering if their robin hood is really ravana who destroyed the golden lanka because of his selfish motives lust and greed
4721975 how can a man who has championed rule of law democracy human rights and the plight of the poor join a group of military officers who overthrow a democratically elected government
4721976 and more surprising an overthrow of a government in which his own party has participated
4721977 it would be premature for me to say im going to change things
4721978 were very pleased the fire chief selection process is over and with a new chief well be bringing our department in a new direction
4721979 im looking forward to it all the good feelings you get from a career position like this it only comes once in a lifetime
4721980 no child no family should be denied critical services because of financial restraints
4721981 id like to see the whole ordinance repealed but this satisfies our concerns
4721982 it would take three to five years to get rid of the backlog assuming we get the funding we need which is 1 000 per case
4721983 its a priority for us weve been working with our police force to try to raise the money
4721984 youve got to have people at the very top who make it a priority
4721985 but no one is willing to make it a top priority
4721986 the funding thats currently allocated will not eat away at the backlog
4721987 unless the kit arrives here and is requested we dont know how many are collected and processed
4721988 we dont really have a backlog at the l a county sheriffs department we have a large commitment to doing the dna sampling
4721989 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4721990 he said id like to do this experiment id like to keep my
4721991 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4721992 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4721993 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4721994 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4721995 as i opened the gate of the pool house the four large dogs were inside the enclosure and they immediately approached me
4721996 one of the dogs snapped at me and i said no to the dog then all of a sudden all of the dogs attacked me and started biting me in various parts of my body and especially about the buttocks and legs
4721997 i swatted at the dogs to push them back and tried to kick them away to protect myself
4721998 i was forced to climb and jump over the fence to escape the dogs
4721999 as i was helped into the house i was staggering and in shock
4722000 my pants were torn about the buttocks and i was bleeding
4722001 did nothing to assist or obtain medical care for me despite the fact he clearly saw me in pain and shock from the attack by his dogs
4722002 i received a call from mr gaye who begged me to refrain from seeking medical attention since the reporting of the dog bites would trigger another investigation by the city department of animal control and the confiscation of the dogs
4722003 i think the publicity may have frozen it in place but were not sure of that we dont know if it got to the smelter before all the publicity
4722004 it probably weighs 70 pounds which means only about 50 pounds of that is copper
4722005 you dont know how many times ive looked at this and said why in the world are we keeping that
4722006 that being said we absolutely sympathize and understand the immense stress that our dmv workers are going through right now
4722007 as a direct result of those layoffs the amount of time customers spend waiting for service has been doubled
4722008 there wasnt any violence but we did have a crowd control issue in the interest of public safety
4722009 other people that work at mcdonalds get paid more than they are
4722010 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4722011 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4722012 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4722013 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4722014 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4722015 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4722016 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4722017 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4722018 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4722019 a solution to the present land row can only be thrashed out between the intellectuals ecologists religious and social personalities
4722020 if he continues to stick to his position and does not resign it will create a situation leaving the government with no option but to ask the army chief to intervene and help resolve the political crisis
4722021 lets face it the british film industry is almost like a cottage industry and we need to collaborate with bigger industries and markets in order to grow
4722022 indian production houses are producing 25 films a year on an average and as such theres no need for new procedures
4722023 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4722024 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter
4722025 some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in pakistan when muslims the world over fast in the holy month of ramazan
4722026 the truth is that even within the pcb there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days
4722027 if the icc manages to convince the teams that champions trophy should be held in pakistan then it would be a major achievement but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage travelling to pakistan
4722028 i dont understand this given the critical situation when the icc task force was in pakistan the chairman was not in the country then why send coach geoff lawson to australia and new zealand when already in the past even the australians were not convinced by his arguments about playing in pakistan
4722029 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
4722030 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday

4722034 to the extent that he has technical defenses thats fine but that level of practice is not acceptable in my office
4722035 if a judge indicates something to you in chambers i would count on my lawyers to pay attention even if theyre not legally bound to what was said
4722036 i have never been a quitter to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body but as president i must put the interest of america first america needs a full time president and a full time congress particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad to continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home
4722037 it is said that you can fool some people for all time all people for some time but not all people for all time
4722038 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4722039 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he opened the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4722040 in the early sessions i just sat there watching him while i was cowering in fright
4722041 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team
4722042 we went on the road together we hung out together
4722043 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4722044 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4722045 as i opened the gate of the pool house the four large dogs were inside the enclosure and they immediately approached me
4722046 one of the dogs snapped at me and i said no to the dog then all of a sudden all of the dogs attacked me and started biting me in various parts of my body and especially about the buttocks and legs
4722047 i swatted at the dogs to push them back and tried to kick them away to protect myself
4722048 i was forced to climb and jump over the fence to escape the dogs
4722049 as i was helped into the house i was staggering and in shock
4722050 my pants were torn about the buttocks and i was bleeding
4722051 did nothing to assist or obtain medical care for me despite the fact he clearly saw me in pain and shock from the attack by his dogs
4722052 i received a call from mr gaye who begged me to refrain from seeking medical attention since the reporting of the dog bites would trigger another investigation by the city department of animal control and the confiscation of the dogs
4722053 i think the publicity may have frozen it in place but were not sure of that we dont know if it got to the smelter before all the publicity

4722059 but no one is willing to make it a top priority
4722060 the funding thats currently allocated will not eat away at the backlog
4722061 unless the kit arrives here and is requested we dont know how many are collected and processed
4722062 we dont really have a backlog at the l a county sheriffs department we have a large commitment to doing the dna sampling
4722063 its bitterly disappointing because we had seven judo players who i firmly believe had medal chances
4722064 they were well prepared and they all gave 100 per cent but it just didnt happen on the day
4722065 i cant really say that anything specific went wrong but there was inconsistent refereeing and even a major power like russia came away without a medal and they spend 10 million euros on their programme however i dont wish to harp on about that
4722066 well be appointing a head coach recruiting new staff and evaluating the athletes
4722067 no no se vayan ustedes a creer que esto lo hacemos para sacar dinero que va de ninguna manera lo que pasa es que queremos que el culpable pague cuanto m s mejor piensan para sus adentros por el mal que ha hecho y para que este suceso sirva de escarmiento a los dem s
4722068 el marcador dice que yo puse la mano en el muro primero
4722069 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude
4722070 vi la carrera despu s en la pantalla gigante y la vi a c mara lenta imagen a imagen en la c mara de masaje en el ordenador
4722071 esto demuestra que no importa lo que pongas en tu imaginaci n que cualquier cosa puede pasar sue a tanto como puedas so ar y cualquier cosa ser posible
4722072 algunas personas dec an que esto ser a imposible y no pasar a esto muestra que cualquier cosa puede suceder antes de que yo fuera a entrenar con bob bowman entrenador del equipo de estados unidos es el nico que realmente me ayud a querer so ar acerca de cualquier cosa
4722073 yo quer a ser un atleta profesional y s quer a ganar medallas ol mpicas pero l es el nico que me dijo que so ara que so ara tanto como pudiera finalmente ha ocurrido el duro trabajo que bob y yo hemos realizado juntos nos ha dado sus frutos
4722074 vi la carrera unos minutos despu s y o algunas cosas sobre un protesta pero no pienso sobre eso es grande ganar una medalla yo no puedo despegar yo s que tengo una llegada larga y phelps una corta no estoy enfadado
4722075 llegu pensando en el bronce y consegu la plata esto es lo que los resultados muestran en la pantalla
4722076 ganar por una cent sima es dif cil es la derrota m s dura pero es un milagro que yo est aqu considerando que hace un a o y medio me iba a retirar estoy disfrutando de coraz n y desear a haber ganado una medalla de oro pero estoy feliz con la plata
4722077 this has been another challenging quarter for madacy a quarter in which sales were significantly lower than the seasonally high second quarter of 2007
4722078 ebitda for the second quarter was weak primarily as a result of a charge in the amount of 3 0 million which we took at the end of the quarter business with mass merchant and specialty retailer accounts was below expectations due in part to a weak retail environment and an overall level of caution regarding inventory levels in addition during the quarter one of our largest customers decided to exit the recorded music business while a significant part of this business has been taken up by our other customers this transition caused a disruption in our business in the quarter
4722079 following the end of the last quarter in response to our overall disappointing financial performance management undertook a significant review of all aspects of its cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses we have taken certain steps to reduce our overall cost structure and continue to focus on other possible cost reductions we expect that certain of the benefits coming out of the completed initiatives flowing from this review will be experienced in the second half of 2008 finally at the end of the second quarter the fund was not in compliance with its fixed charge coverage covenant the fund is currently working with its bank to amend its credit agreement to both revise the calculation of the fixed charge coverage covenant and to make certain other changes to improve the funds working capital liquidity at present the funds non compliance with its fixed charge coverage covenant is being tolerated by its bank

4722083 we missed out on the fa cup final last season so this time we will try to win every trophy
4722084 we have the ability so we will try to develop and achieve even better results than we did last season i believe we can do it because even though we have no new signings we havent lost any players either which is the most important thing
4722085 hes doing very well hes well ahead of schedule and the specialists were surprised with the condition that hes in
4722086 for the next three weeks hell be on rehabilitation then endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4722087 the new additions dont really matter because we know kevins style

4722091 we tried our best but the japanese put the game under their control with their better passing
4722092 they looked well prepared for the game and were the better side of the night
4722093 japan have made sustained progress over the recent years and to be honest they are a stronger side than us
4722094 however we are a young side and we had been given only four months for prepare with a new coaching team
4722095 i am sad we failed to progress into last four but japan were really well organised and attacked very well we are still going through a lot of change and i hope our rebuilding process is going in the right direction
4722096 ik maakte kortere snelle slagen in plaats van me uit te drijven
4722097 ik wil de zwemsport veranderen ik weet zeker dat ik de komende vier jaar nog nieuwe doelen kan stellen
4722098 toen ik mijn laatste slag had gedaan dacht ik dat ik had verloren maar het was precies andersom als ik was uitgedreven had het me te veel tijd gekost daarom maakte ik kortere snellere slagen om mijn hand op de muur te krijgen dat was achteraf de juiste beslissing
4722099 ik heb het frame voor frame bekeken het is bijna niet te zien zo dicht zaten we bij elkaar
4722100 droom zo groot mogelijk als je kan en dan is alles mogelijk ik leef nu in een soort van droomwereld af en toe moet ik mezelf even knijpen om te beseffen dat het echt is

4722102 demand for our services remains solid which is a testimony to the strength of our business model
4722103 in spite of volatile economic environment the fund generated strong revenue performance and strong cash flow second quarter results were impacted by increased crew costs a reality affecting the entire industry
4722104 ele s deu trabalho para nascer porque era prematuro e passei muito mal quase perdi o ces o cinco vezes foi o nico trabalho que ele deu

4722114 we are delighted to have secured someone of jasons quality on a long term deal said martinez
4722115 he proved last season what a deadly finisher he is in front of goal
4722116 jason is a rare breed in the modern game he is someone who relies on his raw talent and a magic touch to score goals
4722117 im 40 now and i think its a good time to start writing it ive done a few things in my life that might be of interest
4722118 patsy has been at the top of everyones hit list for years and publishers are massively excited that she is finally putting pen to paper as this is going to be one of the biggest books of next year

4722230 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm
4722231 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
4722232 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
4722233 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
4722234 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
4722235 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
4722236 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
4722237 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
4722238 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
4722239 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
4722240 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

4722243 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4722244 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4722245 now i need to get people to know who i am
4722246 this turn of events means sen maldonado will have to focus more on winning this race than preparing for a run in 2010
4722247 free to wander about the state to build a statewide campaign
4722248 if the groundwater emergency will help focus peoples attention maybe its a good thing
4722249 we arent any closer than we were a year ago to solving the groundwater and water supply problems in the pajaro valley
4722250 is there some doubt that the county is not going to bring the success theyve accomplished in transportation to the water problem is their mastery of the planning process the basis of their solution to the water problem what is it they will bring based on their history and their performance what is it they are going to bring to the table here except for more wasted money and more pain
4722251 we dont need the supervisors to save us quite yet
4722252 the declaration of groundwater emergency as we all realize does not solve this very grave decades old problem
4722253 your recognition of this problem at least 10 years and billions of dollars of our lost expropriated water resources late can be a beginning
4722254 we were all spending money on lawyers instead of dealing with the issue
4722255 it wasnt obvious to me it was going to work
4722256 there is enough praise to go around but we wouldnt be sitting here today without ryan being the mayor
4722257 even with the conservation measures in the settlement how much growth can you have in a coastal community were maxed out as a town but the university keeps growing and growing
4722258 but this agreement takes the university into a position of responsibility for community impacts that is so far greater than anything theyve had in the past
4722259 the decrease in prices has hurt a lot of people but housing affordability has gone up significantly
4722260 the correction in the market opened up a lot of opportunity
4722261 when the other family backed out we jumped on it
4722262 it has opened up the door to the move up buyer
4722263 were using it throughout the county predominantly in south county
4722264 im up here today to gain a greater knowledge of the operations of the santa cruz harbor
4722265 with that we can be working together as the same sheet of music to be fully interoperable
4722266 it is a great tool for us to help save our natural resources
4722267 we want to get them involved even with the small spills
4722268 although people think smaller spills are not important its still free supplies
4722269 appalachian mandolin and mandolin hymns are two new publications featuring the mandolin playing of butch baldassari just released by homespun
4722270 our presence put pressure on ucsc to negotiate a deal more binding than anything the university has agreed to before but we want more
4722271 the university has not changed its plans to destroy 120 acres of forest and add 4 500 students to this already overburdened city so our opposition is still essential
4722272 i had hoped that they would see the agreement as an opportunity to end their tree sit and declare a victory
4722273 they are sitting on the land where we plan and where we will build a biomedical facility
4722274 we had no interaction with the teachers back home they would just lecture and write on the board and thats it we couldnt e mail them or anything like that
4722275 we could come to class and say whatever we want about the government or politics but in other schools that kind of freedom is not available
4722276 i really learn a lot from them especially how they see things in the u s
4722277 and this group likes to talk and argue a lot so we have a lot of great discussions they are always willing to stake strong opinions
4722278 at home we have all these things like wi fi and iphones but we dont make them there we are just consumers
4722279 theyve just loved their stay here they went down to the beach theyve tried swimming and theyve taken advantage of everything our lovely city has to offer hopefully well send them home with wonderful memories to sustain them through the years

4722290 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4722291 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4722292 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4722293 there are guys that are really good at give and take and theres guys that arent
4722294 ryans one of those guys thats not good at the giving part hes really good at taking brian vickers everybody i passed i didnt have any problems but ryan when you race him the way he races you he just decides to dump you
4722295 bottom line is we were in a position to take and rightfully so we had fresh tires and he was on old tires and he didnt give
4722296 like everybody said tony and i were going to blow up when we were put together
4722297 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing anyway the first time he gets me in a boat and gets me out about 50 feet and says ok were fishing for paychecks today im swimming back
4722298 this sport is about chemistry its got to be the whole picture you cant just drop two drivers in and all of a sudden theyre going to win races
4722299 its going to take some time to build that organization to where tony might want to see it in a few years
4722300 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made the announcement has been huge
4722301 with the addition of ryan coming on board its even going to make that list grow larger
4722302 that is extremely important to me to have somebody that understands the driving part of it the ownership part of it the teammate part of it the personnel part of it which is extremely important now
4722303 i still have a lot of respect for roger and i look forward to the rest of the season and fulfilling my obligations
4722304 but i definitely see the true racer and potential future businessman in tony stewart
4722305 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions from day one
4722306 weve still never spoke about a dollar and a contract from day one the questions were all about how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the job
4722307 were going to have a lot of fun with this
4722308 its hectic and busy and as tedious as the schedule keeps getting every year to have somebody like ryan on board that we know were going to have fun with that makes you look forward to going in there and doing the work each day
4722309 whiskey is for drinkin and water is for fightin over

4722313 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4722314 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4722315 we probably have close to 20 different testing equipment for both clubs and balls
4722316 and some of those are for conformance testing but a lot are for basic research because we do the type of research that needs to be done to make sure a new technology that comes into the game should be allowed within the rules
4722317 we measure the speed we measure the angle of launch and we also measure the backspin those are the three things that a golf club does to a golf ball
4722318 a golf ball in flight is indeed in flight it behaves like a wing and we have to measure how good that wing is and by that we mean the lift and drag
4722319 we fire a golf ball down the range measuring very precisely its trajectory as it goes down that range from that we calculate with a very sophisticated program the lift and drag lift and drag is then combined with the launch conditions we achieved hitting it with the mechanical golfer into another computer program where were allowed and enabled to measure very precisely just how far itll go including bounce and roll
4722320 i think i was a little afraid then but now im calm collected when i go
4722321 i had braces before and i was really interested in what my orthodontist was doing
4722322 when i ask them about how many fillings they have they know they have them but they dont know exactly where
4722323 so theyre becoming more aware of their anatomy and their own oral hygiene so thats part of the goal also
4722324 the nice thing about dentistry is that there are so many different ways of going
4722325 and with so many options there are plenty of career opportunities
4722326 its a lot of hard work i think and a lot of schooling involved
4722327 you get to work with patients and i like working with people and you can apply your science skills and math skills it just looks like a really good career to go into
4722328 det er klart at vi kan ikke v re til grin og bare se p at den ene aftale l ber ud i sandet efter den anden vi har et ansvar for at sikre at de ting vi politisk prioriterer bliver gennemf rt

4722330 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4722331 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4722332 si tenemos una situaci n de encierro tenemos c maras pero la pregunta que tenemos que responder es qu pasa si alguien ingresa
4722333 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4722334 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4722335 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4722336 the rudd government inherited the new immigration detention centre on christmas island which was designed and built to the previous governments specifications as a maximum security facility
4722337 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4722338 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4722339 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4722340 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4722341 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4722342 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4722343 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really sort of lost for words
4722344 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4722345 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations
4722346 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4722347 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4722348 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4722349 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts

4722389 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4722390 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

4722400 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly
4722401 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4722402 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa quality assurance and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4722403 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
4722404 this piece of code was left over from the prerelease versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2
4722405 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
4722406 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
4722407 the targets are specific time bound commitments that will keep us on track to achieve the close the gap goals
4722408 we look forward to working in partnership with the government to refine the targets to ensure they are embedded in future policies and to use them to develop evidence based health programmes targeted to those most in need
4722409 for a long time weve known how to improve aboriginal health were now confident that there is a national commitment from all sides of politics to work in partnership with aboriginal people to close the gap within our lifetimes
4722410 its important that we resist the temptation to cherry pick the specific targets we will only succeed through a well resourced national plan that tackles the whole range of issues from chronic disease to child mortality mental health as well as social and emotional well being
4722411 indigenous people need access to comprehensive primary health care if we are going to be able to halve the rates of premature birth and low birth weight of indigenous babies over the next decade
4722412 a concerted effort is required not just a little more of the same
4722413 we need to immediately implement the national indigenous health workforce training plan for indigenous doctors nurses dentists aboriginal health workers and allied health workers to build indigenous capacity and leadership
4722414 the close the gap goal has been embraced by the australian community and the australian government now there is an outline of how we can achieve it
4722415 the ruckus between the formalists and the intuitionists the intuitionists held that you cant make a statement about an infinite set unless it can be proved in a finite number of steps
4722416 alright and now we know what the l e j b stands for
4722417 its clear that paul dhaliwal doesnt seem to understand that he has to live within the requirements of civilized society

4722425 es que ella es una v bora que me la rob con malas artes y el pobrecito no se dio cuenta porque los hombres son muy tontos
4722426 es que la pobrecita no se da cuenta de que la han embaucado

4722432 madonna ist die unumstrittene k nigin der neuerfindungen und die absolute
4722433 ich finde es sch n wenn es eine frau wie madonna gibt die 50 jahre alt wird so

4722440 oh war das knapp mir sind mehrere steine vom herzen gefallen ich war am herzkasper
4722441 senator wong announced what she called a responsibility agenda taking responsibility for what we are doing to our planet and protecting our economic prosperity
4722442 however the green paper fails to see the bigger picture and take responsibility for the pollution that australia has caused as one of the worlds highest per capita emitters and the devastation this is causing right now for working families just outside our borders
4722443 the nation of tuvalu faces the prospect of disappearing completely as do other low lying islands in the pacific including those in papua new guinea kiribati and the marshall islands
4722444 the governments green paper should have tackled the injustice at the heart of climate change that poor people in developing countries who are the most affected are least responsible for causing climate change
4722445 giving away free permits to high polluters with no end date to the handouts undermines the strength of the scheme and sends the wrong message to business and the australian community
4722446 at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain the worlds poorest people are increasingly vulnerable a decent trade deal could have given them a chance to prevent worsening poverty
4722447 rich countries should have shown the political leadership to deliver trade reform that reduced poverty instead they defended vested interests and put poor countries under intense pressure to make concessions that have no place in a development round
4722448 if the eu and us had made meaningful offers that lived up to their promises we might have seen progress instead they demanded harsh concessions from developing countries in exchange for largely illusory reforms and limited flexibilities
4722449 we admire the resolve of developing countries that held out against a bad deal and maintained unity in the face of unfair strain
4722450 the offers on agriculture from developed countries were inadequate and conditional on harsh concessions on industrial trade in return at a time when prices are volatile developing countries were right to fight for the flexibility to defend their smallest farmers and ensure food security
4722451 this is not just about trading off a few billion dollars in agriculture for a few billion dollars in industrial goods it is about addressing the damage done by decades of rich countries farm subsidies and protectionism on one hand and ensuring that developing countries have the right to industrialise their way out of poverty on the other
4722452 oxfam australia has documented a range of complaints by community members of human rights abuses as oceanagold proceeds with development of the didipio gold and copper mine in the northern philippines
4722453 the complaints include the demolition of homes sometimes without a court order to do so or without sufficient compensation and an escalation in violence which has resulted in two shootings one of a local man in march this year by armed security guards engaged to provide security for housing demolition
4722454 oceanagold and all australian mining companies operating overseas are now being put on notice that the australian government is turning their attention to this issue
4722455 potential investors in oceanagold should be very wary and be aware that they too have a responsibility to ensure that their investments are respectful of human rights
4722456 despite his observer status the prime minister as a regional leader has an important opportunity to also champion the needs of the people of the asia pacific region on rising food prices not just to represent australians on fuel prices
4722457 in thailand expensive animal feed is hurting small scale dairy and livestock producers while consumers are suffering from the rapid rise in food prices especially for items such as pork chicken egg rice and vegetable oil
4722458 in march 2008 the global price of rice hit a 19 year high and the global price of wheat rose to a 28 year high according to the world bank
4722459 we are calling on leaders to recommit to their pledges on aid and to take decisive action to help poor people cope with spiralling food prices by funding developing countries rich countries need to review biofuels policies which are reducing land available for growing food we need to tackle the root causes of these problems the us eu and japan all heavily subsidise their farm industries to the detriment of developing country famers and their products
4722460 it is the worlds poor who are most vulnerable to increased food prices and it is these same people who are affected worst by the impacts of climate change
4722461 we look to the g8 to address the global economic uncertainty but they must also look beyond their own borders and not turn their backs on the worlds poorest people
4722462 insecurity remains a constant problem in chad and the government of chad should work to end the violence which permeates the east of the country the international community must increase its efforts to forward the peace process
4722463 as a regional leader and as a country that is one of the highest per capita carbon emitters in the world we have a responsibility to help those working families just outside our border who are struggling as well
4722464 there are a number of things australia can do such as
4722465 relocation of people is a last resort but australia needs to be better prepared for that eventuation and implementing a quota for climate change refugees is a big part of that
4722466 understandably rising petrol prices and uncertainty about the economy threatens our sense of security and wellbeing
4722467 however i would urge us all to try and see beyond our borders to understand that there are families just beyond our shores whose homes livelihoods and in some cases entire countries are threatened
4722468 we want our children to be able to grow up in their homeland we do not want them to have to become climate change refugees
4722469 this is urgent australians must realise that actions taken here are affecting families just a short flight away

4722473 we didnt know the exact physical state of the initial system but presumably it had one and that state will sometime reach its poincare recurrence
4722474 the essence of borels argument is that macroscopic systems may never be regarded as dynamically isolated even when thermodynamically closed the dynamical coarse graining that is part of the master equation may indeed be ascribed to perturbations by the environment provided the latter obey causality that is can be treated stochastically in the forward direction of time
4722475 an interacting laplacian universe the poincare cycles of its subsystems could in general only be those of the whole universe
4722476 what the bayesian would have us believe is that the methods used are really disguised attempts to apply bayess theorem and the bayesian will happily show you the priors that would give the same result that an after the fact bayesian reconstruction is possible provides no reason to think that if the researchers had started out only with bayesian tools they would have reached the result they did
4722477 last friday professor ross garnaut recognised the urgency of the impacts of climate change and we encourage the prime minister to reflect that level of urgency in his discussions at the g8
4722478 the nation of tuvalu faces the prospect of disappearing completely due to sea level rise as do other low lying islands in the pacific including those in papua new guinea kiribati and the marshall islands
4722479 for the millions of poor people already living with the disastrous consequences of climate change this g8 is a significant opportunity not to be missed we dont need more haggling or finger pointing we need urgent action to ensure emissions peak in the next few years without it decades of progress in the fight against poverty will be undone
4722480 any emissions reductions target for 2050 is a pipe dream without action now
4722481 canada the us and japan are holding the world hostage on 2020 targets and poor people are paying the price china india and all other developing countries already agreed in bali to do their fair share major developing countries and the four european g8 members agree 2020 targets are a benchmark for success at this g8
4722482 billions for their own companies to fund technology and peanuts for the poorest to adapt they talk of a promise to reduce emissions by a date when none of them will be alive yet refuse to address the next few years when they can make a difference and which are absolutely crucial
4722483 never was more urgent action needed by the g8 than this week in japan accelerated climate change runaway food prices and growing poverty are depriving millions of people of their livelihoods and in many cases their very lives
4722484 several governments championed steps to tackle the crucial issues sitting on the g8 agenda but in the end this summit did not deliver the breakthroughs that are so urgently needed the consensus reached was shallow at best especially on climate
4722485 the search for deeper agreement among world powers does not end here it will shape the agenda during italys presidency however millions of people living in poverty can ill afford another year without bold and united leadership
4722486 at this rate by 2050 the world will be cooked and the g8 leaders will be long forgotten the g8s endorsement of a tepid 50 by 50 climate goal leaves us with a 50 50 chance of a climate meltdown we need 80 cuts of 1990 levels by 2050 and emissions to peak and start falling by 2015
4722487 the g8s announcement on 2050 is just another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now taking climate change funds out of aid budgets with overall aid going down is patently unfair every aid dollar diverted to climate adaptation is one dollar less for medicines and schoolbooks
4722488 the facts are clear rich country biofuels are a major cause of the global food crisis at this moment yet the leaders barely mentioned them and blithely continue to burn food in their cars its like discussing the titanic but failing to talk about the iceberg
4722489 the g8 leaders clumsy attempt to backtrack on their aid promises has backfired with two years to go to the 2010 deadline g8 leaders now have to deliver the 50 billion in new assistance they pledged at their 2005 summit the world takes these promises seriously even if the g8 leaders do not
4722490 the g8 failed to rise to the challenge of a world in crisis a world that is demanding serious action we must see renewed leadership in september at the un emergency summit on poverty and in december in poland at the vital un climate talks
4722491 possible to construct a perpetual motion machine of the second kind in such theories using a black hole to catalyze the conversion of heat to work
4722492 lorentz symmetry should be viewed as an emergent property of the macroscopic world

4722500 the apparent paradox presented by such examples if not settled would demonstrate the inconsistency and or incompleteness of the bayesian approach

4722518 in der georgischen kultur spielt die freiheit eine immense rolle in der russischen kultur der begriff gro macht
4722519 es gab nach 1991 immer eine starke bef rchtung dass russland sich irgendwann wieder erheben wird ich vermute dass wir gerade die erste akute phase dieses erhebens erleben

4722525 our presence put pressure on ucsc to negotiate a deal more binding than anything the university has agreed to before but we want more
4722526 the university has not changed its plans to destroy 120 acres of forest and add 4 500 students to this already overburdened city so our opposition is still essential
4722527 weve made a significant transition and the most important thing we can do is bring continuity to the board and to
4722528 to ratchet down our priorities in california to something that grows slower than the economy
4722529 our kids needed to be together so they could heal
4722530 giving them a lot of love and just being there for them watching them grow i treated them like my own thats why this is so hard
4722531 a la derecha que viene el chino rubio a la derecha
4722532 un par de cosas atadas y el resto a improvisar
4722533 you go out there not quite knowing what could happen
4722534 you have to try to have faith in your own abilities in what youve achieved in the past
4722535 but it was far easier for me you can run the 1500m without having the perfect preparation you know that youll at least be in touch until the final 200m or so
4722536 its not the same in the marathon theres a big difference between being fit enough to start and being fit enough to win a medal
4722537 paula will have a problem with her strategy all athletes want to run the way theyre used to the way they like
4722538 if shed run 2hrs 21 mins in london in april shed have a plan of what she could do but that didnt happen
4722539 the athletes who beat mara at the worlds last year yamauchi finished ninth are here and theyve run faster than her
4722540 but she was the top british female last year and she wants to improve against the rest
4722541 it is shown that if two systems with the same intensive parameters but with negative specific heat are thermally coupled the final equilibrium is such that two phases appear at temperatures which are equal in both systems but that can be different from the initial temperature
4722542 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4722543 if you found the biggest diamond in the world who would you call
4722544 do you think these men would have come this far for a hoax
4722545 they aint gonna believe it until they go up and kiss it on the mouth

4722547 are there a lot of psychos in the bigfoot community

4722549 this case serves as another example that with the advances in dna technology we are able to solve cases that might otherwise go unsolved
4722550 im happy this is finally coming to an end im finally able to get that nightmare off my back
4722551 i think theyre very pleased they finally have the right guy
4722552 it really sucks i still get angry watching movies and seeing things like that
4722553 i thought mentally i was ok but maybe not maybe i did need therapy or something
4722554 we dont have any indication that the two were acquaintances
4722555 police were saying things like how could you not know him he lived right next door i said i dont know i dont remember everybody i see for the rest of my life
4722556 oh yeah i love this people actually believe that if you can make it into your driveway garage or inside the house its kind of like kings x or something
4722557 this rule comes from the i wish it were so book of traffic rules
4722558 i have had drivers pull into their driveway with me right behind them and then proceed to tell me that i couldnt trespass on their property
4722559 im sure i dont have to tell you that this did nothing that would enable me to give em a break it always guaranteed a ticket with a side of now let me give you a quick course in what i can and cant do
4722560 the cop can give him a ticket the driver is not safe at home and i can and will knock at the door if there was a long delay between the driver going into the house and the cops arrival and the door isnt answered the cop can always and very easily get a complaint ordering the driver to court last thing i think the driver really ought to think about more constructive things while stuck in traffic
4722561 this is for america this is for nato this is for bush
4722562 want to kill the idea of freedom and by proxy they imagine they fight a war with the united states
4722563 the government is going to help you in the best way possible by doing nothing for you by getting out of your way well i exaggerate but you understand of course we will provide you with infrastructure and help by getting rid of corruption but you have all succeeded by your own initiative and enterprise so you should congratulate yourselves
4722564 although there is no fully satisfactory way of dealing with these issues in the case of gravity i am going to regard these as technicalities
4722565 children are our future and i cant imagine any more effort thats as integral to society and our judicial system
4722566 its never been on the radar screen its something thats been in the back room or the cellar
4722567 dependency cases represent the most intrusive form of governmental intervention
4722568 the indigenous and the poor will be the privileged of my government
4722569 i believe that fundamentally we cannot predict the future why because of the locality of physics
4722570 one of inflations most important predictions is that the universe is most likely to be enormously larger than what we can see which is limited by the present age of the universe this is not just saying that the universe is likely to be billions of times larger than what we can see indeed if inflation is true it seems likely that there are very many copies of us spread throughout our vast universe that have exactly the same genes and memories
4722571 we examine the possibility that the gravitational contribution to the entropy of a system can be identified with some measure of the weyl curvature we are able to impose significant restrictions on measures of the weyl curvature which could reflect the gravitational entropy of a system in particular we are able to show by way of a more general relation that the most widely used dimensionless scalar is not a candidate for this measure along homothetic trajectories
4722572 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4722573 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4722574 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4722575 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4722576 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4722577 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races
4722578 to the extent that he has technical defenses thats fine but that level of practice is not acceptable in my office
4722579 if a judge indicates something to you in chambers i would count on my lawyers to pay attention even if theyre not legally bound to what was said
4722580 we have obtained the best possible help to assist us in the case as asif is adamant he is innocent
4722581 we are having the b sample test for the reconfirmation and we have to be present there inshallah i will be cleared
4722582 if i am cleared which i am confident i will be i will try to make a place for myself in the pakistan team as soon as possible

4722584 consumers are clearly feeling the effects of a perfect storm of challenging economic events such as the mortgage crisis stock market volatility and rising energy costs
4722585 they are reacting by taking a new approach to shopping as our study found that quick trips to the grocery store are declining and major stock up trips that allow consumers to replenish their cupboards for a long period of time are on the upswing

4722587 some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in pakistan when muslims the world over fast in the holy month of ramazan
4722588 the truth is that even within the pcb there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days
4722589 if the icc manages to convince the teams that champions trophy should be held in pakistan then it would be a major achievement but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage traveling to pakistan
4722590 i dont understand this given the critical situation when the icc task force was in pakistan the chairman was not in the country then why send coach geoff lawson to australia and new zealand when already in the past even the australians were not convinced by his arguments about playing in pakistan
4722591 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4722592 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4722593 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4722594 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4722595 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4722596 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4722597 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4722598 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4722599 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that

4722611 we the baloch diaspora fully support president hamid karzais stand that pakistan is behind the upsurge of terrorist actions against afghanistan a fledging democracy that is trying to rebuild after more than quarter century of war
4722612 this is exactly what we baloch nationalists are trying to tell the world that pakistan is part of the problem not part of the solution
4722613 you cannot train a snake it will come and bite you
4722614 not many people know but within pakistan army hameed gul has been the hero for coup leader general pervez musharraf there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that hameed gul is to this day closely connected with both bin laden and mullah omar
4722615 you might be knowing the baloch are now going to the international court of justice to seek justice against the forced annexation of their land on march 27 1948
4722616 we shall appreciate whatever help and support the government of afghanistan can provide to the people of balochistan in this matter
4722617 pakistan army is not only hands in gloves with the islamic terrorists but their soldiers are themselves islamic terrorists in army uniform i do hope president karzai would raise this issue at the joint meeting with president bush on september 27
4722618 the baloch diaspora in the united states and canada extend their full support to your highness
4722619 the convening of grand baloch shahi jirga grand meeting of dar ul umrah the upper house of balochistan parliament is an historic event for the baloch people all over the world
4722620 we can now move forward to pursue our case at the i c j in real earnest
4722621 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4722622 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4722623 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4722624 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4722625 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4722626 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4722627 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4722628 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4722629 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4722630 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4722631 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4722632 what the f am i doing who moves to italy for a semester
4722633 why do international forces not dismantle pakistans policy of double standards
4722634 the unfortunate killings in india and terrorism against israel show islamic militants are out to destroy peace the world over
4722635 pakistani intelligence can no longer hide its role in the criminal acts as they are hand in glove with the islamic terror outfits including al qaeda
4722636 the newsline reporter ghulam hasnain who also writes for the time was kidnapped just one day before the kidnapping of wall street journal daniel pearl
4722637 the pakistan army the seventh largest in the world is one of the most serious threats to world peace business as usual with them would endanger world peace
4722638 little wonder the likes of bin laden and dawood ebrahim have found safe sanctuary in pakistan
4722639 at the same time pakistan has refused to handover father of the islamic bomb abdul qadeer khan to nuclear investigators as the army generals fear he would spill the beans on them
4722640 may i see before my death the days of freedom for the unparalleled plains and meadows of balochistan
4722641 i will not support impeachment against president general pervez musharraf
4722642 bugti dbs displaced people are a problem for us you see they are not accustomed to living in peace and harmony in the past they lived by plunder and loot such offences obviously did not add to their popularity among the people of neighboring cities who were their victims but the government seems to be determined to change the demographic complexion of dera bugti
4722643 has zafarullah stooped so low in front of his punjabi masters that he cant even see the sufferings of another human being let alone that they are from his own race has this man lost his mind to be so insensitive towards this humanitarian tragedy which is unfolding in his front yard while he is concerned about living in peace and harmony
4722644 the baloch nation has tolerated this man for too long zafarullah doesnt deserve to be called a jamali nor a baloch he has shamed the whole baloch nation by his actions to discredit the baloch freedom struggle his callousness towards the baloch refugees and his loyalty to the butchers of the baloch the punjabi raj and its armed forces
4722645 a man like zafarullah is a prime example of a baloch loyalist these people have sold their soul their family their future generations and their nation for monetary and political gains they protect their personal interest at the expense of the people they are supposed to lead loyalists are enemies and traitors of the baloch nation and i declare mir zafarullah khan jamali a loyal servant of the punjabi raj the invaders of balochistan and oppressors of the baloch people
4722646 the killing of nawab bugti and not handing over his body to his next of kin is the latest in the long list of blatant war crimes committed on the people of balochistan
4722647 we must destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond afghanistan dismantle the elaborate networks in the region
4722648 we must ensure that political currents and entities in the region are not allowed to use extremism as an instrument of policy
4722649 in each there shall be virgins chaste and fair dark eyed virgins sheltered in their tents whom neither man nor jin will have touched before
4722650 we hope people understand there will be a great deal of professionals in the area and they need to be given all the room and clearance they can to get on with the work and complete it as soon as possible
4722651 the ministrys order is still that sunrise propane is responsible for this how that will be complied with remains to be seen
4722652 thats what we expected but we just didnt have the data thursday
4722653 all of the levels we got even on the workers removing the asbestos was below that the clearance level of 01 by a factor of five or 10
4722654 we promised the public thursday night that wed put them up and so we put them up
4722655 the health effects usually occur when people are exposed to high levels of asbestos over a long period of time were talking years
4722656 its impossible to overstate the importance of whats un folding as we watch russias invasion of georgia a calculated unprovoked aggression is a crisis that may have more important strategic implications than iraq and afghanistan combined

4722663 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4722664 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4722665 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4722666 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4722667 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4722668 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4722669 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4722695 we will protect national installations in balochistan at all costs and ensure full security to the development activities and to foreign investors chinese there
4722696 the commission has evidence of intelligence services involvement in picking up kidnapping dozens of people in balochistan most not even linked to militant activities
4722697 musharraf also did not mention why only the repeatedly mentioned three sardars were being targeted for removing the oppressive feudal system should the principle also not apply to other sardars in balochistan and feudal overlords in sindh
4722698 the government seems to be backing the tribal system by calling a grand jirga grand council in waziristan rather than following the same ideals to eliminate it
4722699 people familiar with the balochistan situation are aware that the presidents words have no credibility how will his promises and pledges be viewed in other countries when he is unable to convince his own people
4722700 but the bottom line is that the writ of the state will have to be established in balochistan wana etcetera and i assure you that soon there will be peace in that province
4722701 but i would not call him a nawab as he is on the run
4722702 but i can say with full authority that terrorism and anti pakistan activities have been drastically reduced following the governments decision to take action against them
4722703 how could we keep quiet when bomb blasts became a daily routine and people are targeting national installations like railway tracks and government buildings
4722704 gob is in a position to start negotiations with anyone who is interested in neutralizing iran and pakistan
4722705 i have just been contacted by my family and they told me that intelligence agencies had picked up my two brothers samiullah baloch and obaidullah baloch
4722706 they have been picked up by intelligence agencies today their lives are under threat
4722707 everyday intelligence agencies are picking up people in balochistan and its sad that the lives of family members of baloch politicians have been threatened
4722708 i request you all to protest this crime in your personal capacity or through your organizations to the concerned authorities i will be grateful to you all
4722709 nawab akbar khan bugti died and he proved to be the
4722710 it is very shocking to hear the news about the assassination of great baloch leader nawab akbar khan bugti at the hands of blood thirsty pak security forces we share your grief and pain and express our sincere solidarity with the people of balochistan his martyrdom will further strengthen your struggle
4722711 your terrorist sardar is dead im going for sajji in celebration
4722712 today is one of the saddest day in the history of balochistan
4722713 he believed in his principals and honorably died for his conviction
4722714 he is the jesus christ of the baloch nation who sacrificed his own life to save his people
4722715 gob exile and its council members extend our sincere condolences to the bereaved family of nawab akbar khan bugti and to the entire baloch nation
4722716 we pray to god and the ancestors of the baloch that they rest his soul in peace and bring him eternal happiness for being a true martyr may the ultimate sacrifice of every baloch martyr give courage to the baloch nation to avenge his or her death and liberate balochistan
4722717 nawab akbar bugti martyrdom will inspire the baloch people in fighting against the inequality and oppression of the baloch people by pakistan and its tyrant punjabi institutions
4722718 to preserve and strengthen those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound us together as one baloch nation to liberate balochistan
4722719 i am determined to act against those who while not directly involved in committing acts of terrorism provide support for and make statements that glorify celebrate and exalt the atrocities of terrorist groups
4722720 i am also committed to ensuring that those organizations that change their name do not avoid the consequences of proscription

4722728 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4722759 starbucks wordt absoluut een stevige concurrent van ons het is een sterk merk maar het is goed dat de consument straks kan kiezen
4722760 door de komst van starbucks is douwe egberts niet ineens exit sterker nog douwe egberts is en blijft een belangrijke partner voor ons ons doel is reizigers een zo groot mogelijke keuzemogelijkheid te bieden
4722761 steeds meer nederlanders deze manier van koffiedrinken zullen gaan waarderen

4722798 he plays a big role because he can come in in the middle of the game

4722893 one 100th of a second is the smallest margin of victory in our sport and it was pretty cool i guess that is all i can say
4722894 it is evident from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking and the other was gliding we use automatic timing systems and the timing system in this case was in perfect order
4722895 it is a gold medal at stake it is a difficult thing to lose but you have to understand i came into this competition with the goal to win the bronze medal
4722896 it really shows that no matter what you set your imagination to anything can happen if you dream as big as you can dream then anything is possible
4722897 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4722898 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4722899 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4722900 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4722901 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4722902 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4722903 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4722904 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4722905 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4722906 well what am i supposed to do you wont answer my calls you change your number i mean im not gonna be ignored dan
4722907 oh yeah i love this people actually believe that if you can make it into your driveway garage or inside the house its kind of like kings x or something
4722908 this rule comes from the i wish it were so book of traffic rules
4722909 i have had drivers pull into their driveway with me right behind them and then proceed to tell me that i couldnt trespass on their property
4722910 im sure i dont have to tell you that this did nothing that would enable me to give em a break it always guaranteed a ticket with a side of now let me give you a quick course in what i can and cant do
4722911 the cop can give him a ticket the driver is not safe at home and i can and will knock at the door if there was a long delay between the driver going into the house and the cops arrival and the door isnt answered the cop can always and very easily get a complaint ordering the driver to court last thing i think the driver really ought to think about more constructive things while stuck in traffic
4722912 jack emmert on grouped control of a single starship i think it would be a challenge to design a game where being a science officer an engineer the security officer the navigation officer to make that so fun that it would occupy your entire time i think that would be a real challenge i think that it would be possible but it would be like developing 5 games almost in parallel because you would need to develop enough gameplay for somebody as a security officer to enjoy it as much as a captain id think that a lot of people would want to be captains to begin with so its easiest to start there and maybe well expand downwards into other things i wouldnt rule that out

4722914 we exist to help undiscovered aspiring artists showcase their extraordinary talents while offering information needed to help hone their craft
4722915 it cost me a lot of money to look this cheap
4722916 i love you too but i thought i told you to stay in the truck
4722917 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4722918 what our research shows is that individual calls do not carry any specific meanings but different call sequences do
4722919 so for example a series of hacks almost certainly indicates the presence of a crowned eagle whereas a series of hacks preceded by 1 to 2 pyows reliably indicates that the caller is about to start traveling away

4722931 its important to have creative online sportsbook copy business insurance
4722932 because one needs to dodge frivalous law suits and liabilities
4722933 lets get this creative online sportsbook copy project underway and take cues from www mpaa org as needed
4722934 most insurance adjusters will visit an online creative online sportsbook copy business anonymously so they can get an idea of how the website operates
4722935 im happy to introduce limehouse bueter our new head of logistics and transportation
4722936 because with nearly every copy sold the author is rich

4722938 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris
4722939 authorities have said no force should be used against peaceful demonstrations
4722940 he is our hero he has laid a fresh foundation for our freedom struggle with his martyrdom
4722941 be aware of the possibility of malicious activity aimed at mbta information technology it assets and resources
4722942 characterized by a general increase in data theft and data loss
4722943 it is incumbent upon the mbta to ensure that these mit students do not have any additional information that may be used to compromise the mbtas charlie card system
4722944 of course we dont think they should have to hand over these documents
4722945 make a sounder decision about the facts of the case
4722946 the temporary restraining order is unconstitutional a prior restraint of free speech
4722947 its a blur its like a rainbow with chelsea boots on it
4722948 theres johnny borrell theres winehouse theres kimberly stewart theres lots of crazy dancing
4722949 we used to have a garden up the top and i used to run across the ledge in my chelsea boots the ledge of doom i called it they fenced it off because they said you will die and that wont be good publicity
4722950 i had a gun with sticker darts and we were trying to shoot guavas and mangoes off peoples heads it started off as a bit of fun
4722951 before we knew what was happening there were 40 people involved there was a league system going it was amazing
4722952 it was an amazing pub which we all had some great and messy times in
4722953 theres no other places to have a good drink and a good laugh
4722954 ive never once seen kate moss in there i think maybe pete doherty went in once the press overexaggerates it all the time and it gets a bit out of hand
4722955 it was so sociable everyone there was amazing and really fun it was somewhere you could sit back and meet people
4722956 we started going there because we made some friends who lived in camden every so often youd sit next to someone and get chatting and it would turn out that theyre a tv presenter
4722957 we wanted to top it off with winehouse but i dont think shes here
4722958 the forest industry is a large component of our economy and includes a broad re new beta nvidia graphics drivers ver
4722959 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4722960 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4722961 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4722962 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4722963 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4722964 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4722965 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4722966 weve made a significant transition and the most important thing we can do is bring continuity to the board and to
4722967 its clear that paul dhaliwal doesnt seem to understand that he has to live within the requirements of civilized society
4722968 the last thing you want to do in the middle of a high profile lawsuit is get in this kind of trouble
4722969 you are contaminating a potential jury pool by putting yourself constantly in the media for the wrong reasons
4722970 one would think that anybody going to the zoo should be equally protected from the animals no matter what their background
4722971 im not saying the state bar doesnt have the right to look at us
4722972 but its a concern for me as leader of a das office we are human and sometimes were going to make mistakes
4722973 while things may be legal they may not be the level of practice id want
4722974 id want to see that ben knew the difference as prosecutors we are held to a higher standard
4722975 ive never had a problem with ben being honest with me
4722976 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4722977 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4722978 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4722979 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4722980 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4722981 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races
4722982 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4722983 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4722984 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
4722985 the eurofanatics like to claim that great britain is a small island off the coast of europe as if to imply it is like heligoland or gozo they rely on the geographical illiteracy deliberately imposed on our population by the dumbing down of geography teaching
4722986 one of the principal ideological foundation stones of the european union is the nostrum that it preserves peace between previously warring neighbours at first glance that would appear so utterly true as to be beyond argument or doubt but it is so easy to let hubris blind us to an elementary logical lacuna
4722987 our kids needed to be together so they could heal
4722988 giving them a lot of love and just being there for them watching them grow i treated them like my own thats why this is so hard
4722989 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4722990 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4722991 he realized he made a mistake and wanted to turn himself in
4722992 children are our future and i cant imagine any more effort thats as integral to society and our judicial system
4722993 its never been on the radar screen its something thats been in the back room or the cellar
4722994 dependency cases represent the most intrusive form of governmental intervention
4722995 this case serves as another example that with the advances in dna technology we are able to solve cases that might otherwise go unsolved
4722996 im happy this is finally coming to an end im finally able to get that nightmare off my back
4722997 i think theyre very pleased they finally have the right guy
4722998 it really sucks i still get angry watching movies and seeing things like that
4722999 i thought mentally i was ok but maybe not maybe i did need therapy or something
4723000 we dont have any indication that the two were acquaintances
4723001 police were saying things like how could you not know him he lived right next door i said i dont know i dont remember everybody i see for the rest of my life
4723002 the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow friday
4723003 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4723004 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4723005 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4723006 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4723007 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4723008 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4723009 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4723010 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years

4723012 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4723013 der umweltminister sieht keinen handlungsbedarf und taucht in dieser frage ab wir werden handeln
4723014 aber diese aktionspl ne sind unzureichend denn vor allem in graz und wien werden die feinstaubgrenzwerte laufend berschritten also sind die ma nahmen wirkungslos
4723015 um den feinstaub zu reduzieren wurde in wien ein generelles tempo 50 gebot erlassen oder etwa die partikelfilterpflicht f r baumaschinen zus tzlich fordern wir aber auch ein sch rferes bundesgesetz
4723016 ich dachte an einen bildschirmfehler oder dass sich das ergebnis sicher noch ndern wird erst als der heli schrie was normaleweise ein gutes zeichen ist habe ichs kapiert dabei habe ich nach platz sieben im halbfinale an die medaillenchance an das wunder nicht mehr geglaubt vielleicht war ich deshalb so locker solche aufholjagden sind bei uns aber nichts ungew hnliches auf fehler anderer zu hoffen mag ich aber an sich berhaupt nicht
4723017 wir haben das damals verheimlicht damit man mich nicht von der liste streicht ehe ich berhaupt noch draufstehe wir haben das sehr bewusst gemacht weil wir mit leistung berzeugen wollten anfang m rz kam die diagnose am 25 m rz erfolgte im akh linz der eingriff zehn tage sp ter war ich wieder im trainingslager es handelte sich um eine herzrhythmus st rung eine rechtsventrikul re ausflusstachykardie so der fachbegriff bei mir ist das nur bei belastung aufgetreten und war f r sport absolut hinderlich ich musste mich f r den sport oder ein ruhiges leben entscheiden
4723018 ich werde definitiv weitermachen ich will noch viele medaillen gewinnen der sport macht riesenspa das einzige problem ist dass ich auch mein psychologie studium beenden will und irgendwann h tten wir nat rlich auch gerne eine familie
4723019 die situation ist die gleiche wie bei den sch tzen ich habe aber kein pers nliches problem damit es ist f r mich eine supernebenerscheinung es kann kann nicht das erste ziel sein im interesse der medien zu stehen
4723020 jeder tag jeder lauf jede millisekunde im wildwasser ist anders es gibt immer nur berraschungen da kann man einen lauf auch tausendmal durchgehen das wasser macht immer etwas anderes das f hlt sich wahnsinnig toll an
4723021 das war ein eindeutiger nachteil die anderen konnten da schon in peking trainieren keiner hat f r uns versucht eine lanze zu brechen ob sonst noch mehr m glich gewesen w re ist spekulation die ganze situation mit nur einem einzigen rennen f r den quotenplatz ist problematisch sogar der olympiasieger von athen musste deshalb daheimbleiben
4723022 ich bin total abergl ubisch das h rt ab heute aber sofort auf irgendwann wird es zu viel es f ngt bei der zahnpasta an und h rt damit auf wie oft ich mir vor dem rennen eine ohrfeige gebe normalerweise sind es zwei vor dem finale waren es irrt mlich drei dann habe ich gleich noch eine draufgegeben
4723023 ich f hle mich als sterreichern und verstehe 99 prozent aller dialekte es tut vielmehr meiner deutschen familie weh dass ich in der form mit deutschland nicht mehr verbunden bin
4723024 ich m chte in jedem rennen gut fahren ich will noch viele medaillen au erdem arbeite ich immmer noch am perfekten lauf
4723025 wir m ssen definitiv mehr ins fernsehen die kanu worldseries wo ich gut im rennen um ein auto bin wird teilweise vom weltverband boykottiert in der slowakei sind paddler nationalhelden punkto gef hrlichkeit hat der sport definitiv mehr respekt verdient weil er sehr viel mut erfordert auf der em strecke von 2006 ist ein gest rztes m del mit dem fu an einem am stein h ngegeblieben und f nf meter neben dem trainer j mmerlich ersoffen
4723026 wir sind pure idealisten ohne das bundesheer w rde es nicht gehen wir haben zudem sehr viel gl ck mit unserem ober sterreichischen sponsor energie ag

4723028 like all cas certificate authorities globalsign vets a company within strict guidelines but we cannot form an opinion on the software they sign with the issued certificate while we cannot provide a guarantee around the quality of the software the certificate does provide proof of which company is responsible for the software and therefore provides traceability to any parties using that software this traceability allows us to perform an appropriate investigation
4723029 the concept of code signing certificates from any ca whoever they are is designed to provide assurances of origin of the software but cannot express that it is virus free bug free or malware free
4723030 globalsign was made aware of this alleged misuse of a code signing certificate on 15 august at approximately 14 00 the vetting archive was immediately checked to determine what was file for the company llc ajsbiri we were found to have the appropriate company documentation and incorporation documentation needed to vet the origin and existence of a company in line with the practice statement for vetting code signing certificate applicants
4723031 within an hour of the reported incident we had attempted to examine the executable however the site was no longer live after an unsuccessful attempt to contact the company by telephone we decided the best course of action in the short term would be to revoke the certificate the investigation will continue with the company in question to determine why they had potentially been in breach of the subscriber agreement for permitted use of the code signing certificate

4723042 estoy dispuesto a trabajar y trabajar debo ir acostumbr ndome a este ritmo de vida
4723043 no entr a la pol tica para recaudar ni para permitir que otros recauden para su beneficio personal ni estoy aqu para enriquecerme siempre viv de mi trabajo y de la solidaridad de la gente
4723044 much more difficult because the congestion and the difficulty getting in and out and the time it takes to get your car checked out
4723045 if you see some of the facilities in rental car options for terminals on the mainland very impressive compared to what we have here is kind of in the dark ages
4723046 you get dropped off somewhere you gotta walk over somewhere get your car walk over back the same place not just as simple
4723047 the street signs that bring you back to the rental car locations they keep making you change lanes left then right left then right if they could straighten those out it would make it a lot less confusing for people who arent familiar with the airport
4723048 in the mainland its a centralized service where one bus will take you to one central terminal
4723049 if you want to travel thats part of the cost of traveling
4723050 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4723051 la firma de este acuerdo por el presidente saakashvili significa que debe imponerse inmediatamente el alto el fuego y que las tropas regulares rusas tienen que abandonar el territorio georgiano

4723053 he developed the most extensive contacts of any area experts ive ever seen at the national archives
4723054 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4723055 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
4723056 negli occhi della gente si vede quello che vedranno non quello che hanno visto
4723057 ma quanto vive luomo vive mille anni o uno solo vive una settimana o pi secoli per quanto tempo muore luomo che vuol dire per sempre
4723058 toglimi il pane se vuoi toglimi laria ma non togliermi il tuo sorriso dura la mia lotta e torno con gli occhi stanchi a volte daver visto la terra che non cambia ma entrando il tuo sorriso sale al cielo cercandomi ed apre per me tutte le porte della vita
4723059 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime

4723063 the military judge has the sole authority to determine whether or not any given filings can be released
4723064 he was required to get permission and he did but the parole officer said he should have gotten another permission to go there for another day
4723065 this proposal was brought to us from perth racing and ted van heemst earlier this year and will put perth racing on the international map
4723066 we will support perth racing with 6 million as part of the new festival of perth racing which will centre on the railway stakes making it one of the richest races in australia
4723067 the railway stakes will be the centrepiece of a racing event which will have international and national appeal drawing people from all over the world to perth for the festival of racing
4723068 the 6 million will assist perth racing increasing stake money for the railway stakes from 1million this year to 3 million next year 4 million in 2010 and 5 million in 2011
4723069 this will make the perth festival of racing one of the richest and attractive racing carnivals in australia
4723070 i just see it as a kind of rather public and vulgar kind of exhibitionism
4723071 it is in poor taste it is telling the other citizens of bombay mumbai i dont care for you i am so much greater than you
4723072 half of the city lives in slums there is a desperate need to rectify that situation
4723073 i think antilia is disgraceful and disgusting theres a degree of callousness which i think is unbelievable even greek tycoon aristotle onassiss yacht wasnt that lavish
4723074 as an architect i am concerned because a project like antilia appears to be a green project but it is not green building
4723075 we like to promote sustainable architecture architecture that is humane and that is more humble
4723076 the british and the maharajas used to live with great opulence
4723077 they had opal rooms and crystal rooms and pearl rooms that was the lavishness of those days it took a different form today these businessmen are our new colonial rulers

4723081 das ziel besteht erkennbar darin die seit langem betriebene kampagne gegen watzal durch einen massiven konzertierten einsatz zum erfolgreichen abschluss zu bringen es scheint dabei weniger um die person zu gehen als um das ziel durch exemplarische bestrafung eines israel kritikers einen einsch chternden effekt zu erzielen die wortf hrer dieser kampagne berufen sich dabei auf die in der europ ischen union vor drei jahren verabschiedete arbeitsdefinition des antisemitismus dort wird erstmals der begriff des antisemitismus ganz offiziell auf kritik an der israelischen regierungspolitik ausgeweitet in der ffentlichkeit fand dieses dokument bisher kaum beachtung die angriffe gegen watzal dienen auch dazu jetzt die praktische umsetzung der tendenzi sen neudefinition einzufordern wenn das in diesem fall gel nge w re ein beispiel f r k nftige kampagnen gesetzt

4723085 in todays world we have competition that did not exist 30 years ago
4723086 we find ourselves in competition with screens computer screens tv screens movie screens

4723105 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4723106 this case serves as another example that with the advances in dna technology we are able to solve cases that might otherwise go unsolved
4723107 im happy this is finally coming to an end im finally able to get that nightmare off my back

4723119 the university has not changed its plans to destroy 120 acres of forest and add 4 500 students to this already overburdened city so our opposition is still essential
4723120 im not saying the state bar doesnt have the right to look at us
4723121 but its a concern for me as leader of a das office we are human and sometimes were going to make mistakes
4723122 while things may be legal they may not be the level of practice id want

4723140 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials

4723142 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4723143 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4723144 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4723145 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races

4723150 the cop can give him a ticket the driver is not safe at home and i can and will knock at the door if there was a long delay between the driver going into the house and the cops arrival and the door isnt answered the cop can always and very easily get a complaint ordering the driver to court last thing i think the driver really ought to think about more constructive things while stuck in traffic

4723182 the origins of the conflagration in june in kashmir on forest land allocation for construction of facilities for the amarnath yatra lie in open state promotion of the pilgrimage the yatra has caused considerable damage to the economy and ecology of the area the high handed actions of the shri amarnath shrine board only aggravated the situation
4723183 the sasb runs a virtually parallel administration and acts as a sovereign body promoting hindu interests increasing the number of pilgrims from 12 000 in 1989 to over 400 000 in 2007 and extending the period of the pilgrimage from 15 days to two and half months

4723190 like all cas certificate authorities globalsign vets a company within strict guidelines but we cannot form an opinion on the software they sign with the issued certificate while we cannot provide a guarantee around the quality of the software the certificate does provide proof of which company is responsible for the software and therefore provides traceability to any parties using that software this traceability allows us to perform an appropriate investigation
4723191 the concept of code signing certificates from any ca whoever they are is designed to provide assurances of origin of the software but cannot express that it is virus free bug free or malware free
4723192 globalsign was made aware of this alleged misuse of a code signing certificate on 15 august at approximately 14 00 the vetting archive was immediately checked to determine what was file for the company llc ajsbiri we were found to have the appropriate company documentation and incorporation documentation needed to vet the origin and existence of a company in line with the practice statement for vetting code signing certificate applicants
4723193 within an hour of the reported incident we had attempted to examine the executable however the site was no longer live after an unsuccessful attempt to contact the company by telephone we decided the best course of action in the short term would be to revoke the certificate the investigation will continue with the company in question to determine why they had potentially been in breach of the subscriber agreement for permitted use of the code signing certificate
4723194 i say to my friend capello terry is a good choice a very good choice
4723195 we were sixth last season and the goal is to be better this time we were close to liverpool for a lot of time last season and now we have a stronger squad there is no reason to believe that we cant reach the top four
4723196 it is my belief and i hope that everyone else believes it as well we have a chance to do it
4723197 this is a challenge for me and i do like a challenge there is a great environment at the club and i like the way that we all pull together
4723198 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other
4723199 when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
4723200 it is like when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4723201 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game but within the respect of the game
4723202 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football
4723203 the beauty in the game is to win within the respect of the rules but we will do whatever it takes to win a football game
4723204 and as for whether you can win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4723205 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations
4723206 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester

4723209 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4723210 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4723211 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4723212 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4723213 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4723220 i think at its worst it allowed the policing to targets culture to take hold so at its worst at its most extreme it encouraged that sort of policing to targets
4723221 operation sheridan was previously run in march when it resulted in four separate arrests for supply offences
4723222 additional success was seen in the disruption of dealer networks in march including the seizing of motor vehicles from known suspects by the roads policing unit
4723223 i would like to thank residents and visitors who came into contact with officers in ryde for their co operation and support we are also grateful for the continued commitment of ferry operators wightlink

4723278 well continue to work even as we have with him being pushed back originally
4723279 it does provide additional opportunity to continue to work in the bullpen
4723280 i think if anything the one turn missed because of the weather the acquisition of paul byrd gives him a chance to kind of relax a little bit and continue to work toward the next outing on wednesday
4723281 he just kind of realizes now what he can do with the bat hes learning himself hes strong as hell hes always had it in him when hes getting in those hitters counts hes looking to do some damage maybe in the past he looked for that perfect pitch take the 3 1 pitch now hes getting the pitch if hes in a hitters count hes looking to do some damage
4723282 his walks are down but when his walks are down and hes doing what hes doing when hes swinging the bat i dont mind that at all
4723283 hes driving in runs hes driving in big runs for us hes a guy that i think all of us are very comfortable having him in there whatever the situation is if we need a run driven in we like having him up there
4723284 weve had struggles from time to time and i dont know that its necessarily been when somebodys been out
4723285 i think when people have been out we have a bench casey alex cora that we can play a lineup that we think we can win so i dont think theres ever been any point where theres been a discomfort or anything i think we really believe in the guys that are playing

4723290 you never want to see someone get hurt but at the same time it opened a door for me
4723291 a lot of the last few games i feel ive had the opportunity with guys not only on base but in scoring position its been fun being productive and having the opportunity to be productive right away it makes it easier
4723292 thats how you earn respect in this game youve got to produce
4723293 you can show up and people respect you for your work ethic but if youre producing thats how people are really going to respect you
4723294 you bring a young kid up to play and you basically hope that he makes the plays and knows how to play the game and things like that
4723295 all of a sudden it seems like hes getting a big hit every time he comes up and there seems to be men on base and his production has been off the charts so its been a welcome addition in maybe an area where you dont have a right to expect that much its been great
4723296 i think thats just the type of hitter he is
4723297 it bodes well especially if youre a lefthanded hitter in this ballpark and you have the ability to use the wall thats going to make anybody better
4723298 they throw the ball down and in hes turned on it and hit it down the right field line theyve left it up hes hit it off the wall
4723299 any time you can do that its going to make you feel better at the plate
4723300 they called strike one on him i thought it was up and away then he worked the count fouled a bunch of balls off and eventually made an out that was a great at bat
4723301 dont be mistaken its not like im showing up at 6 30 and going out at 7 oclock to play
4723302 im here at 1 30 in the afternoon preparing myself to play i know how difficult this game is and itll humble you very quickly
4723303 yeah im hot right now but its not a matter of whether youre hot or cold its a matter of whether youre putting in the work every day
4723304 you step in for the first time and you think about the history of this park and all the great players who have walked through this clubhouse
4723305 the first time i walked in here i see these guys in there and youre in awe
4723306 i can do breaks and in cuts the consistency and endurance are still not where they have to be
4723307 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4723308 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off

4723322 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4723323 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4723324 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4723325 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4723326 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4723327 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4723328 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4723329 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4723330 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4723331 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4723332 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied
4723333 they said the formula is gone that it was already given away
4723334 i have a hysterical feeling im so worried about not being able to feed her
4723335 i came here to get some food i have not even a penny
4723336 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4723337 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4723338 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4723339 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4723340 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4723341 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4723342 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4723343 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4723344 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4723345 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4723346 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4723347 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4723348 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4723349 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4723350 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4723351 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4723352 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4723353 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4723354 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4723355 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4723356 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4723357 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4723358 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4723359 i had just put my mouth under the tap to rinse away the toothpaste when the lightning must have struck the building

4723510 i have warned you of a saiqa a destruction awful cry torment hit a thunder bolt like the saiqa which overtook ad and thamud people
4723511 this is my reply to your proposition now take what course you find best
4723512 o king we were plunged in the depth of ignorance and barbarism we adored idols we lived in unchastity and we ate dead bodies and we spoke abomination we disregarded every feeling of humanity and sense of duty towards our neighbors and we knew no law but that of the strong when allah raised among us a man of whose birth truthfulness honesty and purity we were aware he called us to profess the unity of allah and taught us to associate nothing with him he forbade us the worship of idols and enjoined us to speak the truth to be faithful to our trusts to be merciful and to regard the rights of neighbors he forbade us to speak evil of the worship of allah and not to return to the worship of idols of woos and stone and to abstain from evil to offer prayers to give alms to observe the fast we have believed in him we have accepted his teachings and his injunctions to worship allah alone and to associate nothing with him hence our people have persecuted us trying to make us forego the worship of allah and return to the worship of idols of wood and stone and other abominations they have tortured us and injured us until finding no safety among them we have come to your kingdom trusting you will give us protection against their persecution
4723513 allah has not sent me to work wonders he has sent me to preach to you
4723514 why has muhammad not been sent with miracles like previous prophets
4723515 because miracles had proved inadequate to convince noah was sent with signs and with what effect where was the lost tribe of thamud they had refused to receive the preaching of the prophet salih unless he showed them a sign and caused the rock to bring forth a living camel he did what they asked in scorn they cut the camels feet and then daring the prophet to fulfill his threats of judgment were found dead in their beds the next morning stricken by the angel of the lord
4723516 o my uncle if they placed the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand to cause me to renounce my task verily i would not desist therefrom until allah made manifest his cause or i perished in the attempt
4723517 say whatever you please for by the lord i shall not desert you ever
4723518 while i was lying in al hatim or al hijr suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here
4723519 he then took out my heart then a gold tray of belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled with belief and then returned to its original place then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me
4723520 the animals step was so wide that it reached the farthest point within the reach of the animals sight i was carried on it and gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven
4723521 when he asked for the gate to be opened it was asked who is it
4723522 when i went over the second heaven here i saw john yahya and jesus isa who were cousins of each other
4723523 the gate was opened and when i went over the fourth heaven there i saw enoch idris gabriel said to me this is enoch pay him your greetings
4723524 when i went over the sixth heaven there i saw moses musa
4723525 so when i went over the seventh heaven there i saw abraham ibrahim
4723526 this is the lote tree of the utmost and boundary
4723527 then the sacred house was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me i took the milk gabriel remarked this is the islamic religion which you and your followers are following then the prayers were enjoined on me they were fifty prayers a day when i returned i passed by moses who asked me what have you been ordered to do i replied i have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day moses said your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day and by allah i have tested people before you and i have tried my level best with bani israel in vain go back to your lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers
4723528 when i came back to moses he said what have you been ordered
4723529 we will not associate anything with allah we will not steal nor commit adultery or fornication nor kill our children as the pagan arabs used to do when they apprehended that they would not be able to maintain them nor forge calumnies we will obey the prophet in everything that is reasonable and we will be faithful to him in well and sorrow
4723530 i never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion islam and i dont remember a single day passing without our being visited by allahs messenger in the morning and in the evening when the muslims were put to test troubled by the pagans abu bakr set out migrating to the land of abyssinia ethiopia and when he reached bark al ghimad ibn ad daghina the chief of the tribe of qara met him and said o abu bakr where are you going abu bakr replied my people have turned me out of my country so i want to wander on the earth and worship my lord ibn ad dhagina said o abu bakr a man like you should not leave his homeland nor should he be driven out because you help the destitute earn their living and you keep good relations with your kith and kin help the weak and the poor entertain guests generously and help the calamity stricken persons therefore i am your protector go back and worship your lord in your town so abu bakr returned and ibn ad daghina accompanied him in the evening ibn ad dhagina visited the nobles of quraish and said to them a man like abu bakr should not leave his homeland nor should he be driven out do you quraish drive out a man who helps the destitute earns their living keeps good relations with his kith and kin helps the weak and poor entertain guests generously and helps the calamity stricken persons so the people of quraish could not refuse ibn protection and they said to ibn ad daghina let abu bakr worship his lord in his house he can pray and recite there whatever he likes but he should not hurt us with it and should not do it publicly because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children
4723531 then a thought occurred to abu bakr to build a mosque in front of his house and there he used to pray and recite the quran
4723532 at that time the prophet was in mecca and he said to the muslims in a dream i have been shown your migration place a land of date palm trees between two mountains the two stony tracts
4723533 one day while we were sitting in abu bakrs house at noon someone said to abu bakr this is allahs messenger with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before
4723534 tell everyone who is present with you to go away abu bakr replied there are none but your family may my father be sacrificed for you o allahs messenger the prophet said i have been given permission to migrate abu bakr said shall i accompany you may my father be sacrificed for you o allahs messenger allahs messenger said yes abu bakr said o allahs messenger may my father be sacrificed for you take one of these two she camels of mine allahs messenger replied i will accept it with payment so we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them asma abu bakrs daughter cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it and for that reason she was named dhat un nitaqain the owner of two belts then allahs messenger and abu bakr reached a cave on the mountain of thaur and stayed there for three nights abdullah ibn abi bakr who was an intelligent and sagacious youth used to stay with them overnight he used to leave them before daybreak so that in the morning he would be with quraish as if he had spent the night in mecca he would keep in mind any plot made against them and when it became dark he would go and inform them of it amir ibn fuhaira the freed slave of abu bakr used to bring the milch sheep of his master abu bakr to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there so they always had fresh milk at night the milk of their sheep and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it amir ibn fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark before daybreak he did the same in each of those three nights allahs messenger and abu bakr had hired a man from the tribe of bani ad dail from the family of bani abd ibn adi as an expert guide and he was in alliance with the family of al as ibn wail as sahmi and he was in the religion of the infidels of quraish the prophet and abu bakr trusted him and gave him their two she camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of thaur in the morning after three nights later and when they set out amir ibn futhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the seashore
4723535 the messengers of the pagans of quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons who would kill or arrest allahs messenger and abu bakr a reward equal to their bloodmoney
4723536 then i took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low then i reached my horse mounted it and made it gallop when i approached them muhammad and abu bakr my horse stumbled and i fell down from it then i stood up gold hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether i should harm them or not and the lot which i disliked came out but i remounted my horse and let it gallop giving no importance to the divining arrows when i heard the recitation of the quran by allahs messenger who did not look hither and thither while abu bakr was doing it often suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees and i fell down from it then i rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground and when it stood up straight again its forelegs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke then again i drew lots with the divining arrows and the lot which i disliked came out so i called upon them to feel secure they stopped and i remounted my horse and went to them when i saw how i had been hampered from harming them it came to my mind that the cause of allahs messenger islam would become victorious so i said to them your people have assigned a reward equal to bloodmoney for your head then i told them all the plans the people of mecca had made concerning them then i offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything but the prophet said do not tell others about us then i requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace he ordered amir ibn fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment and then allahs messenger proceeded on his way
4723537 the jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice o you arabs here is your great man whom you have been waiting for so all the muslims rushed to their arms and received allahs messenger on the summit of harra the prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of bani amr ibn auf and this was on monday in the month of rabi ul awal abu bakr stood up receiving the people while allahs messenger sat down and kept silent some of the ansar who came and had not seen allahs messenger before began greeting abu bakr but when the sunshine fell on allahs messenger and abu bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know allahs messenger allahs messenger stayed with bani amr ibn auf for ten nights and established the mosque mosque of quba which was founded on piety allahs messenger prayed in it and then mounted his she camel and proceeded on accompanied by the people till his she camel knelt down at the place of the mosque of allahs messenger at medina some muslims used to pray there in those days and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to suhail and sahl the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of asad in zurara when his she camel knelt down allahs messenger said this place allah willing will be our abiding place allahs messenger then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque the two boys said no but we will give it as a gift o allahs messenger allahs messenger then built a mosque there the prophet himself started carrying unburned bricks for its building and while doing so he was saying this load is better than the load of khaibar for it is more pious in the sight of allah and purer and better rewardable he was also saying o allah the actual reward is the reward in the hereafter so bestow your mercy on the ansar and the emigrants thus the prophet recited by way of proverb the poem of some muslim poet whose name is unknown to me
4723538 all future disputes arising among those who accept this charter shall be referred under allah to the prophet
4723539 blessing be on the men of medina they made us ride while they themselves walked they gave us wheaten bread to eat when there was little of it contenting themselves with dates
4723540 is it not enough for you that your lord allah should help you with three thousand angels sent down yes if you hold on to patience and piety and the enemy comes rushing at you your lord will help you with five thousand angels having marks of distinction allah made it not but as a message of good news for you and as an assurance to your hearts and there is no victory except from allah the all mighty the all wise that he might cut off a part of those who disbelieve or expose them to infamy so that they retire frustrated
4723541 if we had anything to do with the affair none of us would have been killed here
4723542 even if you had remained in your homes those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death
4723543 the prophet appointed abdullah ibn jubair as the commander of the infantry men archers who were fifty on the day of the battle of uhud
4723544 the booty o people the booty your companions have become victorious what are you waiting for now
4723545 by allah we will go to the people the enemy and collect our share from the war booty
4723546 the prophet and his companions caused the pagans to lose one hundred and forty men seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed
4723547 you have had a quarrel with men ignorant of the art of war if you are desirous of having any dealings with us we shall show you that we are men
4723548 thus will the empire of chosroes be torn to pieces
4723549 who among you is closely related to that man who claims to be a prophet
4723550 i am the nearest relative to him amongst the group
4723551 bring him abu sufyan close to me and make his companions stand behind him
4723552 heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man the prophet and if i told a lie they my companions should contradict me by allah had i not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar i would have not have spoken the truth about the prophet
4723553 has anybody among you ever claimed the same to be a prophet before him
4723554 does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards
4723555 have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim to be a prophet
4723556 no we are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it
4723557 he tells us to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship anything along with him and to renounce all that our ancestors had said he orders us to pray to speak the truth to be chaste and to keep good relations with our kith and kin
4723558 i asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family in fact all the messengers come from noble families among their respective peoples i questioned you whether anybody else among you claimed such a thing your reply was in the negative if the answer had been in the affirmative i would have thought that this man was following the previous mans statement then i asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king your reply was in the negative and if it had been in the affirmative i would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom i further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said and your reply was in the negative so i wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about allah i then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor you replied that it was the poor who followed him and in fact all the messengers have been followed by this veryclass of people then i asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing you replied that they were increasing and in fact this is the way of true faith till it is complete in all respects i further asked you whether there was anybody who after embracing his religion became displeased and discarded his religion you reply was in the negative and in fact this is the sign of true faith when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely i asked you whether he had ever betrayed you replied in the negative and likewise the messengers never betray then i asked you what he ordered you to do you replied that he ordered you to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship anything along with him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray to speak the truth and to be chaste if what you have said is true he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and i knew it from the scriptures that he was going to appear but i did not know that he would be from you and if i could reach him definitely i would go immediately to meet him and if i were with him i would certainly wash his feet
4723559 at night when i looked at the stars i saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared become the conqueror who are they who practice circumcision
4723560 except the jews nobody practices circumcision so you should not be afraid of them jews just issue orders to kill very jew present in the country
4723561 o byzantines if success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this prophet embrace islam
4723562 what was already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and i have seen it

4723584 what was already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and i have seen it
4723585 for you to acknowledge that there is no deity save allah and that i am his messenger
4723586 verily we have given you o muhammad a manifest victory that allah may forgive you your sins of the past and future and complete his favor on you and guide you on the straight path and that allah may help you with strong help ch 48 1 3 quran
4723587 allah is great truth has come and falsehood has vanished verily falsehood is fleeting
4723588 o mankind we have created you for a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another verily the most honorable of you in the sight of allah is that believer who has at taqwa one of the muttaqun pious and righteous persons who fear allah much abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden and love allah much perform all kinds of good deeds which he has ordained verily allah is all knowing all aware ch 49 13 quran narrated hishams father when allahs messenger set out towards mecca during the year of the conquest of mecca and this news reached the infidels of quraish abu sufyan hakim ibn hizam and budail ibn waraqa came out to gather information about allahs messenger they proceeded on their way till they reached a place called marr az zahran which is near mecca behold there they saw many fires as if they were the fires of arafat
4723589 keep abu sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the muslims
4723590 they are the ansar headed by sad ibn ubada the one holding the flag
4723591 o abu sufyan today is the day of a great battle and today what is prohibited in the kaba will be permissible
4723592 sad told a lie but today allah will give superiority to the kaba and today the kaba will be covered with a cloth covering
4723593 i heard al abbas saying to az zubair ibn al awwam o abu abdullah
4723594 allahs messenger ordered khalid ibn al walid to enter mecca from its upper part from kadaa while the prophet himself entered from kudaa
4723595 oh my lord i am innocent of what khalid has done
4723596 messenger of allah my father is dead my brother my only relation fled into the mountains on the approach of the muslims i cannot ransom myself i count on your generosity for my deliverance my father was an illustrious man the prince of his tribe a man who ransomed prisoners protected the honor of women fed the poor cothe afflicted and was deaf to no appeal
4723597 your father had the virtues of a true muslim if it were permitted to invoke the mercy of allah on any whose life was passed in idolatry i would pray to allah for mercy for the soul of hatim
4723598 the daughter of hatim is free her father was a generous and humane man allah loves and rewards the merciful
4723599 no idolater shall after this year perform the pilgrimage no one shall make the circuit of the kaba naked such a disgraceful custom was practiced by the pagan arabs and treaty with the prophet shall continue in force but four months are allowed to every man to return to his territories after that there will be no obligation on the prophet except towards those with whom treaties have been concluded

4723601 o lord i have fulfilled my message and accomplished my work
4723602 never decide between any two parties who come to you for justice unless you first hear both of them
4723603 from mussaylamah the prophet of allah to muhammad the prophet of allah peace be to you i am your partner let the exercise of authority be divided between us half the earth will be mine and half will belong to your quraish but the quraish are too greedy to be satisfied with a just division
4723604 from muhammad the messenger of allah to mussaylamah the liar peace be to those who follow the right path the earth belongs to allah it is he who makes the reign whomsoever he pleases only those will prosper who fear the lord
4723605 o muslims if i have wronged anyone of you here i am to answer for it if i owe anything to anyone all i may happen to possess belongs to you
4723606 better to blush in this world than in the next
4723607 by the lord in whose hand lies the soul of muhammad as to myself no man can lay hold on me in any matter i have not made lawful anything excepting what allah has made lawful nor have i prohibited anything but that which allah in his book has prohibited
4723608 o fatimah my daughter and safia my aunt work you both that which procure you acceptance with the lord for verily i have no power to save you in any wise
4723609 no he is not dead he will be restored to us and those are traitors to the cause of islam who say he is dead if they say so let them be cut in pieces
4723610 o muslims if anyone of you has been worshipping muhammad then let me tell you that muhammad is dead but if you really do worship allah then know that allah is living and will never die do you forget the verse in the quran
4723611 muhammad is not more than a messenger and indeed many messengers have passed away before him if he dies or is killed will you then turn your back on your heels as disbeliveers and he who turns back on his heels not the least harm will he do to allah and allah will give reward to those who are grateful

4723640 we are delighted to be reunited with a major label in universal music wake the sleeper is an album we are incredibly proud of and one that we hope the fans will see as one of uriah heeps best we cant wait to get back out on the road to showcase the new songs
4723641 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4723642 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4723643 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4723644 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4723645 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4723646 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4723647 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4723648 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4723649 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4723650 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4723651 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4723652 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4723653 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4723654 diesmal stehe ich aber nicht so nah an ihrem fahrzeug
4723655 und nun erz hlte er mir konkret von seinem rechten fu kn chel von schrauben platten und n geln und hielt kurz seinen orthop dischen schuh hoch w hrend er einstieg
4723656 aber denkense nicht ich w r letztens danach einfach weggefahren
4723657 ich mu te sogar abgeschleppt werden meine wegfahrsperre blockierte der spa hat mich 1400 euro gekostet
4723658 kuckense mal hier der ist am montag 20 geworden ich meinte meinen golf und zeigte auf seine armaturen an dem ist nix dran da kann auch nix kaputtgehen kein airbag kein nix
4723659 wegfahrsperre das ist nur was f r die werkst tten wenn einer ein auto stehlen will dann macht der das ob wegfahrsperre oder nicht und h rense auf von airbag
4723660 da hatte ich letztens einen unfall auf der autobahn mit 270 km h berschlagen
4723661 der hat mir ein blaues auge gehauen der hat mir die brille vors auge gedr ckt der hat mir die hand aus dem fenster geschlagen
4723662 co2 storage is essential for continued use of coal when co2 controls are imposed by congress
4723663 coal seams will be a major way that co2 will be stored and the russell county test which begins monday is the most important federally funded step to date in proving the ability of coal seams to sequester co2
4723664 in theory its been tested but not actually ever in a coal mine area
4723665 im not aware of it happening anywhere else in the country this a project where we are working closely with the scientists and engineers with virginia tech on
4723666 i think that this is just the beginning of one of the ways we can capture carbon dioxide
4723667 i think it is really a big step if we are going to burn coal and burn coal in a clean fashion capturing the pollutants that go into the air is an important thing
4723668 its going to be a big thing for west virginia as well because you have a lot of power plants up in west virginia along the ohio river and kanawha river
4723669 if we can find someway to take care of the carbon footprint i think the other things we are concerned with can also be taken care of if we can burn coal in a clean way that will open our coalfields up to more coal mining and help our economies as well
4723670 senate bill 722 passed in march by the legislature required the board of pharmacy to set up rules for the free clinics
4723671 free clinics would have to get a pharmacy license to give free meds to their patients
4723672 pharmacists are in short supply in west virginia we would also be asking a pharmacist to put their license on the line
4723673 the rules even stops nurses and nurse practitioners from giving out medicines
4723674 we keep no controlled substances and we dont write prescriptions for them
4723675 they give me my insulin they give me my blood pressure pills my fluid pill and my cholesterol medicine
4723676 without this free clinic i wouldnt be able to do anything
4723677 i wouldnt be able to manage my diabetes and i wouldnt be able to control it
4723678 and she has never been to the hospital we keep them out of the hospital and we keep them healthy
4723679 we have a five page list of rules and protocols and drugs have to be in date unexpired
4723680 the hospitals emergency departments would become their medical homes because they will not have gotten their medications
4723681 we know there are pcbs here and we know there has been remediation at this site in the past
4723682 were going in right now to disconnect the oh ohs disconnecting them from the waterway that is connected to the storm water
4723683 the whole bluestone pcb issue in west virginia and virginia has been the subject of collaborative sampling by the epa west virginia department of environmental protection and virginia department of environmental quality
4723684 we have already found a couple of connections to the drainage line
4723685 the key thing is that we are taking a disconnecting action here
4723686 after that well take a little break and figure out what needs to be done and who is going to do it
4723687 whether its the epa or a corporation it will be fixed one way or another
4723688 hacemos un llamado a las autoridades judiciales para que env en una circular informando a los jueces de todo el pa s que el nuevo c digo penal entr en vigencia y que el mismo establece que los juicios por abuso sexual son juicios t cnicos y no pueden participar jurados de conciencia a la vez hago un llamado a los jueces para que en sus decisiones prime el bien superior de las ni as ni os y adolescentes como establece el c digo de la ni ez
4723689 aqu los abogados se valen de muchas artima as para que los t rminos de ley se venzan y las autoridades permiten que eso ocurra los testigos se cansan de presentarse a los juzgados y que los devuelvan a sus casas porque los abogados de los abusadores piden permisos a los jueces hay un desgaste emocional de parte de las v ctimas y sus familias son revictimizadas y para colmo el delito que se comete contra ellas y ellos queda impune

4723710 and i want to make harry look like a smart man again for bringing me to the club
4723711 i think harry tried to get me in january but charlton didnt want to let me go then

4723765 typically 35 per cent of a houses water use is for showers and 30 per cent for flushing
4723766 decorating a home is like going on a road trip youre looking to constantly please the eye and i love to think of smaller homes as a jewel box someones very own little magic haven where in every cupboard and corner theres a surprise in store

4723775 for years british food was the butt of many jokes

4723779 i just see it as a kind of rather public and vulgar kind of exhibitionism
4723780 it is in poor taste it is telling the other citizens of bombay mumbai i dont care for you i am so much greater than you
4723781 half of the city lives in slums there is a desperate need to rectify that situation
4723782 i think antilia is disgraceful and disgusting theres a degree of callousness which i think is unbelievable even greek tycoon aristotle onassiss yacht wasnt that lavish
4723783 as an architect i am concerned because a project like antilia appears to be a green project but it is not green building
4723784 we like to promote sustainable architecture architecture that is humane and that is more humble
4723785 the british and the maharajas used to live with great opulence
4723786 they had opal rooms and crystal rooms and pearl rooms that was the lavishness of those days it took a different form today these businessmen are our new colonial rulers
4723787 the designs are old country style reflecting the century old estate homes in downtown grimsby theyve got large porches board and batten exteriors with siding and stone accents and they were designed specifically for the large lots
4723788 i only have room for one car and i cant park on the grass because it damages it and im getting tickets
4723789 i thought that this was just what we needed because our daughter was driving our old car and we only had a single driveway
4723790 if you park on it all the time the grass will turn a bit brown but for occasional parking its fine
4723791 and when you move you can just pick it up and take it with you
4723792 e mail 2 0 innovaci n de herramientas colaborativas para los negocios
4723793 they give up their homes and need a business address these units are all in active locales they are all luxury brands and they could be the finest senior residences on the planet
4723794 you dont have to admit someone else is looking after you weve all sat at the edge of the bed in a hotel suite and said i could live here you think youd order a 22 cheeseburger in every saturday afternoon but dont though you know its there
4723795 empty nesters come from family homes and look for a maintenance free lifestyle where they can lock the suite door and go to the airport
4723796 and a fair number of buyers are existing condo buyers but upgrading moving on up
4723797 they are not start up people but they are not just older people there are a group of people who dont have children but have careers they dont want houses and they dont garden so they dont need a backyard it does require money and maybe they inherited it or made it
4723798 the goal is for forest hill and rosedale to move to shangri la
4723799 shangri la in asia has brand recognition like sony and coca cola
4723800 calgary is probably the most american city based on oil and gas vancouver is the most liveable and toronto is a vice president city these are addresses that can support those brands
4723801 they know with the four seasons what the quality will be
4723802 people talk about brand loyalty with cars and clothing and we dont think about it in terms of real estate but people who buy are four seasons fans they dont stay anywhere else when they travel and the draw is not just local it is international
4723803 youll not see another five star hotel built in north america because you need the profit from the condo to build the hotel to show a return
4723804 todays land and construction costs to run it dont make sense
4723805 there is nowhere to go but up the gta is confined by green belt
4723806 that mansion in the sky on top of regular hotel units didnt exist a few years ago
4723807 it flourished in paris new york san francisco but not in toronto the hotel business started it it is a very good way to finance hotels and people liked it because you can have all the hotel services at your doorstep its an investment with hotel services
4723808 the number of luxury brands and the number of addresses is capped look how long it took for four seasons to search for a location to replace the tired hotel
4723809 if i live at shangri la its a qualifier life must be good in addition to instant brand recognition its like waterfront property a brand protects resale
4723810 people still want to live in the best place there has been an upswing in the market for almost a decade and last year was a peak year for condos
4723811 most pay cash for high end condos there is no mortgage
4723812 they consider toronto a pretty safe place to put your money and it is developing into a world class city
4723813 this is not targeted at the first time homeowner but the empty nester the affluent baby boomer
4723814 and there will be more of these boomers than condos to suit them over the years

4723824 if salvation is for any it is for all the return to the lost the excluded the failed or destroyed is not an option for the saint but the very heart of saintliness and we might think not only of jesuss parable of the shepherd but of the great theological myth of the descent into hell in which gods presence in the world in jesus is seen as his journey into the furthest deserts of despair and alienation it is the supreme image of his freedom to go where he is denied and forgotten he comes to his new and risen life his universal kingship by searching out all the forgotten and failed members of the human family

4723829 making a good middle east e gaming development brand is absolutely key
4723830 you dont want to inadvertently steal someone elses hard work
4723831 but at the same time you have to cite your sources so that your claims to middle east e gaming development knowledge are based on fact
4723832 i ran to the nearest marketing forums and began spilling the beans about how my websites achieved top positions in the search engines two months later my competition who read all my posts figured out how to top my sites and i lost 30 of my revenues fool me once shame on me
4723833 like any entrepreneurial venture the middle east e gaming development sector comes with substantial risk
4723834 so if your bank roll cant afford the initial investment or if you just dont have enough time wait until things are clearer before setting out to work on new middle east e gaming development projects
4723835 i worked in the middle east e gaming development internet marketing field for two years before going solo
4723836 and business finally started to bloom big time when i learned to harvest the power of search engine optimization with my middle east e gaming development sites ranking higher than ever my profits soared
4723837 mostly because i had no clue what to do there were no guides or reference books just my gut instinct over time i trusted my intuition and used common sense to move forward
4723838 when my website got going i soon received many offers from foreign companies with stolen email lists and sleazy marketing methods they promise quick riches the easy way but in fact there is no easy way to making bank in the middle east e gaming development field it comes down to creativity and hard work
4723839 each year we are faced with the challenge of having to design a new collection of looney tunes shorts that outshines the last
4723840 our objective for the sixth volume was to create an attention grabbing volume that is a combination of some of the rarest most original and best loved cartoons that even the savviest of animation connoisseurs would want to own looney tunes are an important part of american cinematic history and these wonderful collections give us the opportunity to appreciate the beauty wonder and artistry behind the art of animation looney tunes golden collection vol 6 is the type of dvd collection that collectors will want to add to their home entertainment libraries
4723841 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said of him behold an israelite indeed in whom there is no deceit
4723842 o lord you have searched me and known me you know when i sit down and when i rise up you understand my thought from afar you scrutinize my path and my lying down and are intimately acquainted with all my ways even before there is a word on my tongue behold o lord you know it all
4723843 for a righteous man falls seven times and rises again
4723844 i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
4723845 the steps of a man are established by the lord and he delights in his way
4723846 eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
4723847 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
4723848 and when i came to you brethren i did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of god for i determined to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of god
4723849 they are not of this world even as i am not of this world
4723850 no one after putting his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kindom of god
4723851 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid again and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
4723852 therefore since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us fixing our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
4723853 walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time
4723854 come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest
4723855 when the day of pentecost had come they were all together in one place and suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting and there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves and they rested on each one of them and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit was giving them utterance
4723856 in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
4723857 look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not worth much more than they and who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more clothe you you of little faith
4723858 to the jews i became as a jew so that i might win jews to those who are under the law as under the law though not being myself under the law so that i might win those who are under the law to those who are without law as without law though not being without the law of god but under the law of christ so that i might win those who are without law to the weak i became weak that i might win the weak i have become all things to all men so that i may by all means save some

4723861 why not just go help rebuild a katrina house in new orleans if that is the kind of thing you into
4723862 when i think of the wisdom and scope of gods plan i fall to my knees and pray to the father the creator of everything in heaven and on earth i pray that from his glorious unlimited resources he will give you mighty inner strength through his holy spirit
4723863 now glory be to god by his mighty power at work within us he is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope
4723864 all things work together for good for them that love god to the called according to his purpose
4723865 but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me
4723866 sing and make melody in our hearts to the lord
4723867 all scripture is inspired by god and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives it straightens us out and teaches us to do what is right it is gods way of preparing us in every way fully equipped for every good thing god wants us to do
4723868 and god will generously provide all you need then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others as the scriptures say godly people give generously to the poor their good deeds will never be forgotten for god is the one who gives seed to the farmer and then bread to eat in the same way he will give you many opportunities to do good and he will produce a great harvest of generosity in you yes you will be enriched so that you can give even more generously and when we take your gifts to those who need them they will break out in thanksgiving to god

4723881 and exterminated the entire adult male population of this country
4723882 that model was misnamed free trade which as we know well is a freedom that imprisons people a big lie because thats the name that the global north gives to everything that it preaches but doesnt practice
4723883 i think all who are at this table are for liberation and for me who comes from that theology this is an extremely happy moment
4723884 is to practice not so much theology as liberation because what matters to god is not theology it is the concrete liberation of individuals

4723897 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4723908 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected

4723952 hi there i am theresa and yes i am doing the optifast diet it is wonderful after the first 10 days do not cheat and swim swim swim if you will follow the plan exactly you have to be under a dr s supervision right you will lose about 10 lbs the first week when i started i weighed 248 lbs and i lost 14 lbs
4723953 i am on my 10th week of optifast its tough its all shakes and a protein bar of some sort plus lots of water it was very hard at first not to cheat but if you want to get to your goal its possible you can lose 3 to 5 pounds a week on this plan all weeks but one i lost one week i gained 1 6 pounds but i changed my exercise routine and noticed i should not have i dont think its impossible to maintain the loss during the program you have to take these classes they go over things how to deal with stuff when your off the program stress people that may sabotage your weight loss it teaches alot once you finish the 12 weeks if you want to lose more you can extend another 6 weeks other wise you move into transition which is a 6 week process thats when you slowly add food into your diet i dont know all the details yet but i know that its very sucessful and expensive
4723954 my mom was one of the first case studies on optifast through mayo clinic many many years ago back was it was just optifast with no number after it she lost a little over a hundred pouds and maintained very well afterward its a very tricky diet there is no food invovuled for 12 plus weeks and then you eat just green beans or peas then add a little more and then weeks later a litte more food and less optifast its very expensive and shouldnt be used unless your bmi is over 30 i think thats the right number they have optifast clinics i wuold recommended going through them
4723955 i have just started on it this week after my friend lost 20kg using it 5 months ago she used it for 12 weeks then when she finished she ate better and has kept the weight off
4723956 i have been using the optifast shakes for the last week and ive lost 3kg it cost approx 38 for 21 shakes now i must tell you that you are supposed to replace your 3 meals with the shake drink 2 lts water and 2 cups of veggies in the first stage as i only need to lose 10 kgs and i thought id stave doing that this is what ive been doing breakfast 1 shake 1 2 cup bran amp skim milk cup black tea lunch 1 shake 1 piece fruit cup of coffee with skim milk
4723957 we want to keep those guys as organized as we can we definitely dont want to overuse them usually when you get from this part of the season to the end guys are called upon to pitch more and you will use them more just because of the importance of where youre at in the standings and the importance of the game
4723958 so far i think weve done pretty good with that
4723959 its because of the games all the games have been one run games and its nip and tuck the whole way i think weve done a pretty good job with spreading it all out but its that time of year
4723960 fortunately weve got enough experience down there the guys have been through a 162 game schedule so theyre somewhat accustomed to it but at the same time wed like to get some one sided games so they can get some days off
4723961 unfortunately weve probably had to use chad a little too much at times
4723962 but with rudy seanez down you get into a situation with a bunch of righthanders up but we try to stretch it out as much as possible both ryan and chad have had some eighth inning stuff ideally wed like to use them in the seventh but theyre the guys that are going to have to get the eighth inning done for us but theyve been very solid for us
4723963 it hadnt been my best season but i saved my best performance for the games
4723964 it is just another race and i like to think of it that way
4723965 but its also way bigger than i thought it would be
4723966 it was a fun game to be a part of
4723967 those guys have obviously known each other for a long time i bet there were some guys who werent even born yet when they started its pretty neat to see both of them pitching well at this point its pretty fun to be a part of
4723968 it just goes to show you if you know what you are doing and you know how to get it done you dont have to throw 95 to 100 to get it done
4723969 our eyes met during last nights orgy i couldnt catch
4723970 i thought he played well particularly in that fourth quarter in a lot of different areas both special teams and on the offense
4723971 when i got here it was you better be able to contribute on special teams
4723972 i had never played special teams in 4 years of college but i knew this preseason i would have an opportunity to show the coaches i can contribute on special teams and i can contribute running the football i know the assignments i know how to pick up the blitz
4723973 it was awesome when i handed to him and turned around the hole was as big a truck and he just did the rest but an even better play was when i threw him a low pass and he caught it with one hand and picked up a first down and we scored a few plays later that got us on a roll
4723974 with five running backs in training camp it is hard to get reps but you just have to be patient i knew i would get the reps in preseason games and when i got that chance i just wanted to do as much as i could
4723975 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4723976 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4723977 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4723978 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4723979 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4723980 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4723981 i googled him on yahoo and he seems pretty interesting
4723982 it doesnt matter if we play china or cuba or venezuela
4723983 china is only one of the teams we have to play in these preliminary games i try to concentrate on the game and not be emotionally involved

4723985 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer was second
4723986 the difference was that one was stroking and one was gliding
4723987 i knew i would be in the lead after 50 meters
4723988 but i also knew michael phelps was a back half swimmer
4723989 the last eight meters i put my head down and i did not breathe
4723990 when i took that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race
4723991 it wasnt until i took the goggles off and saw the 1 next to my name that i was sure id won
4723992 and i came within 0 01 of a second of beating michael phelps getting a gold im very happy
4723993 i think i need to go home and stay dry for a while
4723994 if you were there you would have seen i was firing above him at my manager i have nothing against michael phelps hes the king do i want to make a rivalry of this sure why not but ive never disrespected anyone im not going to start with michael phelps
4723995 getting into the hall of fame has allowed me to do some really cool things and this is one of them
4723996 they said no i said how can you not be nervous these are tougher kids i dont know
4723997 i thought our defense played pretty solid football but offensively we obviously had too many drops
4723998 you cant drop that many footballs in the game and expect to move the ball consistently we have to cut down on the penalties its good that theyre happening now so that we can get them corrected and worked on so that they dont happen during the season
4723999 it looked like he got a bit tired he banged up his leg and fell on his knee but he bounced back which was a good thing he was a little sore but he pulled himself back and worked his way through it and it worked out for him i thought he caught the ball ok he had a couple drops in there that we need to make sure we take care of
4724000 we all know the history of rookies playing here in philadelphia so you dont want to put too much pressure on jackson
4724001 im sure well have packages for him to be involved in
4724002 coach marty mornhinweg has a lot of things in the offense for me im just trying to do my best and get open as much as possible
4724003 kick returns punt returns interceptions theres just a certain feeling you get when you have the ball in your hands if im on the field long enough something is going to happen for me thats a proven fact
4724004 i should have got the sack but he threw it before i could get there
4724005 i put my hands up learning from brian dawkins he always puts his hands up i just put mine up and tipped the ball
4724006 i guess ill take the silver it was a hard day for everybody
4724007 were so dominant to come in here and get spanked like this it makes you reflect we have a lot of work to do
4724008 if you would have told me that distance was going to win it this morning i would have said youre full of expletive
4724009 she was able to keep food inside both ways by wednesday
4724010 the environment was good the idea was good but it just didnt turn out
4724011 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4724012 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4724013 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4724014 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance
4724015 at that point i didnt really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4724016 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4724017 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4724018 every time he gets a hit he tells me its the hair
4724019 it was just surprising to hear him say that nobody was close to soto
4724020 all i know is that hes healthy and he threw the ball well
4724021 if i would have played last night it would not have been good
4724022 i would have hurt the team more than i would have helped lets put it that way but today its a full step in the right direction im not going to worry about it im at the point now where i can manage it and it will be ok
4724023 thats the bottom line im not going to be satisfied with any loss frankly im probably not going to be satisfied with any win either im always striving to get better
4724024 if it doesnt i think well be ok since they have played together in years past if i had my choice id much rather have them do that
4724025 the major league deal is basically what it took in order to get it done
4724026 its not a money negotiating issue as much as a life choice at this moment in time
4724027 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4724028 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4724029 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4724030 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4724031 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure

4724037 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4724038 we all want to win the race for him but if the horse races well my dad if he was here would be the first person to be happy and not complain
4724039 he would be disappointed but as long as the horse raced well and came back sound it was a successful day
4724040 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4724041 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4724042 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4724043 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4724044 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4724045 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4724046 he plays a big role because he can come in in the middle of the game
4724047 in the fifth through the seventh inning he can come in and get people out or pitch an inning or get a righthand hitter or two out and that allows us to keep madson and durbin organized in the back end of the bullpen in the seventh or eighth inning
4724048 i told them i want a playoff share and a ring
4724049 as much as all of us want to be in the lineup every day especially me knowing my chances are few and far between taking 1 day to let it relax and let it calm down immediately bypasses missing 7 8 or 15 days if you have to go on the dl

4724053 there are moments in our lives where we find ourselves at a crossroads afraid confused without a roadmap the choices we make in those moments can define the rest of our days of course when faced with the unknown most of us choose to turn around and go back but once in a while people push on to something better something found just beyond the pain of going it alone and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in or give someone a second chance something beyond the quiet persistence of a dream because its only when youre tested that you discover who you are that you discover who you can be the person you can be does exist beyond the hard work faith belief and beyond the heartache and fear of what lies ahead
4724054 i had to take my goggles off to see the 1 next to my name
4724055 when i took that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race
4724056 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer finished second
4724057 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4724058 it was a real honor to race michael phelps and being in that situation where all eyes were on me
4724059 is when someone says you cant do something it shows you anything is possible
4724060 canada hasnt won a medal last i checked so do we have any hopes for that besides softball

4724063 ive been able to avoid all that because i dont know anything
4724064 its been a lot better and a lot more exciting than i thought it was going to be
4724065 they canada have just got to beat venezuela now then they get into the top four which is where they want to go to get into the medal round
4724066 shes an olympic veteran i havent been there ive got nothing for her
4724067 i know she was just excited because they have a chance to medal
4724068 i had three surgeries on my left knee and it doesnt feel the way i need it to in order to continue playing in the nhl
4724069 i spent last year in los angeles and rehabbed down there
4724070 its gone well but the rigours of the nhl are great and my body isnt up to it any longer
4724071 its somewhat of an experiment too to see whether coaching is what i want to pursue after playing
4724072 i certainly enjoy watching hockey and studying it and strategizing im certainly not taking a misstep by taking this opportunity to coach
4724073 if coaching doesnt work out i have a lot of time to study or work or get a degree
4724074 i grew up dreaming of playing in the nhl and i got there
4724075 it was everything i wanted it to be and probably more when you live your dream for 10 years its not a bad thing
4724076 i havent heard anything so i still consider myself a florida panther
4724077 toronto would be home i guess but my home is here in florida it would be quite an adjustment but whatever happens happens if the panthers want to move me they will but i like it here im just going about my business
4724078 jacques has never said he is looking to trade me but its part of the game
4724079 this florida is obviously where i want to be i want to win here
4724080 some of them are wearing a bit too little maybe but i can accept it

4724087 prosecutors interviewed chen on friday regarding the swiss bank accounts
4724088 we have notified them to return to taiwan as soon as possible for the investigation through the former president
4724089 prosecutors interviewed chen on friday regarding the swiss bank accounts
4724090 they were really cheerful and they were in good condition they were thankful to be brought down the snow was very deep as you can see we have had a huge snowfall
4724091 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels maybe that is a problem to get them in australia i am not sure
4724092 they didnt have a guide they were a private group it is always good to have a guide if you are an inexperienced group i am not sure of the experience level of the group i do know there were some novices
4724093 we can get serious snowfalls and seriously cold temperatures these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that
4724094 there would have been a lot more wind distributed snow it moves around i heard one guy say it was up to his neck travelling in those sorts of conditions is very difficult
4724095 in the southern alps you have got altitude and high mountains near the ocean you get a lot of serious snowfalls we get 50 metres of cumulative snowfall a year here
4724096 they dug in and they had plenty of food and supplies
4724097 but its definitely easier when theyre younger it gets so much harder theyre very emotional theyre a little slower you have to deal with a lot of other things when theyre younger theyre like a soldier now i have to prove it myself to her we spend more and more time on that
4724098 it wasnt easy for nastia to be second but i never believed nastia was no 2
4724099 some judges maybe like shawn but nastias level of gymnastics is high we calculate our course and come to the conclusion she is not second she just makes mistakes
4724100 this morning when i woke up i knew there wasnt anything else that could make me better
4724101 i just had to give it my all and hope it was enough
4724102 and she now knows that and after the practice im her father but its very hard for everybody im not going to hide that we had our moments credit my wife there she helps out a lot shes always mediator
4724103 i hope he is as proud of this as i am
4724104 well we cant block a lot of people and we cant run with the ball real well and we certainly cant catch it very well mustve had 10 or 12 drops
4724105 theyll get a whole week off a chance to go out and reload a little bit
4724106 see if we can come back and be mentally tough about it
4724107 my head wouldnt be where it needs to be to enjoy golf
4724108 weve got the people we just have to keep working find a way to get it done

4724112 i thought when i took that extra half stroke at the end id lost the race i guess it proves im finishing my races
4724113 i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow
4724114 i had a long finish and michael had a short finish im not angry
4724115 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4724116 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4724117 it was evident from the video that it was an issue of stroking
4724118 one swimmer phelps was stroking the other cavic was gliding
4724119 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay
4724120 i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there

4724126 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4724127 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4724128 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4724129 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4724130 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4724131 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that

4724178 hillary feels no guilt about encouraging her supporters to mess up obamas big moment thus improving her odds of being the nominee in 2012
4724179 my focus is to get the cost of imported oil down and the only way you can do that is to cut down on the imports
4724180 you can push health care and education off to the side
4724181 if you cant solve this problem youre not going to have enough money to do anything
4724182 focus on the positive its time we start talking about some of the good things
4724183 how long are we going to talk about this before we do something about it
4724184 the american people have had it past their eyeballs with senators and government talking about it
4724185 no one believes that drilling is going to lower the price of gas in the near future
4724186 just how stupid do they think the american electorate is
4724187 everybody knows that two oil executives have run the white house for seven years everybody knows that big oil gives gobs and gobs and gobs of money to republicans and comparatively very little to democrats
4724188 by leaving abusable and addictive medications like oxycontin and vicodin around the house thus making these drugs readily available to their children these problem parents become passive pushers
4724189 it has taken far too long for fema to address this nationwide problem but im pleased that the agency will finally inspect the fuel tanks in reno fallon and winnemucca
4724190 i will continue to closely watch this situation to ensure that fema takes all measures necessary to protect the health and safety of those communities
4724191 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat

4724196 alice was a proud and independent woman and someone who loved music and song
4724197 so in the spirit of frank sinatra i must say alice did it her way
4724198 she used to tell people i was born on george washingtons birthday but he was just a couple of years older than me
4724199 its who we are in nevada it would be such a loss to have that whole top of those two mountaintops taken away and put these 250 foot towers up there
4724200 negatively impact the environment economy and quality of life in their counties
4724201 whats happening in nevada is just a heightened version of what is happening and will happen all over america youve got a new environmental ethic that is at times in conflict with an older environmental ethic which presents a real conundrum
4724202 nobodys quite figured out how theyre all going to go together
4724203 even more inappropriate is the possibility that the agents are negotiating firearm transactions and handling firearms while under the influence of narcotics
4724204 the people formerly known as the audience wish to inform media people of our existence and of a shift in power that goes with the platform shift youve all heard about
4724205 give the people control of media they will use it the corollary dont give the people control of media and you will lose whenever citizens can exercise control they will
4724206 tom curley ceo of the associated press has explained this to his people
4724207 the users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be what application what device what time what place
4724208 who doesnt want to just sit there but to take part debate create communicate share
4724209 they want control over their media instead of being controlled by it
4724210 we have had a number of cities including augusta come over and see what were doing to try in some way to duplicate the efforts that we have made here
4724211 since this has all taken place we have seniors who will sit outside in the evenings and will walk the streets
4724212 to get started you need passionate individuals who really care about creating a better way of life for individuals in those communities and it takes not just the government doing it on their own it takes the community working with those who will be staying in the community churches housing authority all working together to create this vision that you want to have for your town
4724213 our goal was to have 50 new housing units a year on the north side
4724214 we are well ahead of that our other goal was to totally redo certain neighborhoods like asheton oaks and toole hill
4724215 the feel of a neighborhood is actually the people and the relationships they have it helps maintain and build a sense of camaraderie
4724216 once they could see that the rest of the infrastructure and housing stock improving they were ready to go ahead and stay and put in the necessary time to upgrade their home
4724217 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
4724218 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
4724219 taken as a whole and judged by community standards it appeals to the prurient interest in sex depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner and lacks serious literary artistic political and scientific value
4724220 we havent had any routes that have been what i would call overloaded
4724221 it could be the result of growth it could be the result of gas prices
4724222 there are still some routes that were looking at so i would just plead for patience
4724223 thats just a safety net so we dont have to leave kids on the side of the road
4724224 the ones that are crowded is because we consolidated the routes
4724225 the songs touch people differently depending on who you are and where you are in life but the book of job has something for everyone
4724226 i would rather see it on tv live rather than someone calling me after seeing it on the internet
4724227 i just feel bad for him because he worked so hard to get there
4724228 i know hes got to feel pretty rough right now he knows there were a lot of people rooting for him that bothers him some because he feels he let them down but were proud of him whether he finished first or seventh or 22nd
4724229 im going to see spongebob and im not coming back until reese is on
4724230 i had to go home and get on the internet to see it
4724231 theyve got all this stuff going on and they cant break away for a minute of it
4724232 the bad thing is i know and he knows hes the best in the world
4724233 his ability to recover after races and get up and swim again at that level is incredible
4724234 its nice to know putting in the work pays off
4724235 i think its just been great just for the publicity everywhere
4724236 someone who has a skin condition they are segregated into colonies because they have a skin condition as a matter of fact folks think lepers shouldnt run for president
4724237 did not give us a spirit of fear some of you had fear that the family life center would not be completed i stopped by here all the way from chicago to tell you you have nothing to lose
4724238 as beautiful as our building is we just ran out of space
4724239 we want to be a community minded church this is another portal for them to access what were doing we wont have to be scrambling for space anymore
4724240 we believe god has given us a mandate to reach out and better the lives of others through jesus christ
4724241 this is a vision that began when he the rev moss was here in 2004
4724242 i couldnt think of anybody else to be a part of this than pastor moss
4724243 so we have to balance our strategic investments with assuring that were providing adequate support to our core operations to maintain excellence
4724244 my bias is of course that medical education and health the relationship of that to the work force are extremely important
4724245 that is a very important indicator that our science here is outstanding
4724246 what we do is go into an intergovernmental agreement with the county
4724247 we give them a list of our tier 1 2 and 3 items
4724248 it will enable us to keep up with the growth
4724249 it will allow us to do some renovations and building expansions and also do some additional recreation projects
4724250 i came off the mound and stood up and looked around and thats when i first saw how big the crowd was
4724251 it makes it a lot easier when its loud like that and you know theyre behind you
4724252 tonight was a great crowd and im glad we were able to give them something to cheer about
4724253 some people actually called me to see how i did in the second round of the perry watson they didnt want to wait until it came out in the paper
4724254 one thing that kept me away was a pride thing i didnt want to go out there and shoot a big number
4724255 im nowhere near being competitive yet but that 72 the second day at gordon lakes showed me ive still got it
4724256 i wanted to play in a few and see where i stacked up
4724257 its going to take two good events for me to do it
4724258 they know their rent amount and thats all they pay starting a new business is a lot easier when you know your costs
4724259 i definitely could not afford a space of my own i would have had to increase my prices
4724260 its their place to use i want to give them the opportunity to run the business the way they need to run their business
4724261 other businesses in the same industry should help each other
4724262 im thankful to have a location so clients can gain confidence in me just to have a business location its been great
4724263 we just wanted to get them out here run the football and not get any injuries
4724264 it is essential to have a deep understanding of the culture of our time in which the social communications media are most influential using the media correctly and competently can lead to a genuine inculturation of the gospel
4724265 we call it catholic radio but its radio for all people
4724266 i grew up only taking care of my career and future these men were just bothering me
4724267 but they treated me very well as a chinese man i thought they just wanted to get something out of me
4724268 i wouldnt feel comfortable with the idea of practicing my faith in china
4724269 in china most people are atheists nobody talks about christ the bible any of it
4724270 people in china arent going to be as open about their religious beliefs
4724271 for most of them coming to america is a huge adjustment they teach only evolution in china theyve never heard of creationism the concept of everlasting life is so foreign to them
4724272 maybe by then there will be more choices the church is growing the believers are growing
4724273 right now china needs help theres nothing done overnight but things are getting better
4724274 could they stand on a street corner like evangelists do here never
4724275 officially china has freedom to worship but they pump you so full of their own theology there isnt room for anything else
4724276 o presidente da r ssia dmitri medvedev e a chanceler alem angela merkel n o souberam encontrar um ponto de contacto durante a discuss o da situa o em torno da oss tia do sul na imprensa de imprensa conjunta depois do encontro cada um falou das suas posi es confirmando que n o se chegou a um acordo nas avalia es das causas e consequ ncias do conflito militar

4724282 dari sekian anak bangsa yg berprestasi di negara orang kapan pemerintah bisa merekrut mereka demi kemajuan bangsa
4724283 di indonesia sebenarnya banyak orang jenius cuma pemerintah tidak peduli pada pendidikan dan kurang peduli pada prestasi anak bangsanya sendiri akibatnya kebanyakan orang indonesia yang berprestasi justru pindah atau bekerja untuk bangsa lain

4724289 the only way only children are reliably different from others is they score slightly higher in academic achievement
4724290 we think they should get rid of the god amp country name it lends credence to the perception of discrimination
4724291 whether they are trying to discriminate or not perception is everything

4724293 my olympic coaching and support team of julian robertson yvette yun luo andy allford and hannah behan gave their all in this olympic campaign
4724294 their commitment to the cause was fanatical i could not have asked anything more it has been an inspirational creative and dynamic coaching unit

4724299 hannah gave the team an extra dimension her work on analysis has been extremely creative and motivational and she brings a lot of passion and positivity
4724300 many others have played extremely important roles in ensuring that this team was well prepared for the games we are so very grateful for that
4724301 it seems very clear to me this year that the unfortunate practice of paying circulators by the signature seems to directly correlate to the significant amount of bad signatures being collected
4724302 as i have called for in the past the legislature should look closely at this problem and at the problem of privately funded voter registration drives that arent properly getting people registered
4724303 in the end both of these problems are negatively affecting this years petition process as being among the largest failure rates in the history of our state
4724304 kpcs investment in the nansha project wont be affected by chinas economic situation even if it slides down slightly
4724305 the continued surge in diamond trade is testament to dubais success in attracting traders from around the world we have witnessed healthy growth in bilateral trade with various countries reflecting the growing confidence in the trading infrastructure and opportunities offered by dubai

4724326 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4724327 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4724328 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4724329 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4724330 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4724331 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4724332 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4724333 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4724334 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4724335 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming

4724337 the christian view seems to be that sex is an unfortunate fact of life but for jews this is an opportunity that god gives every couple so in our view we should try to use it as an expression of deep love

4724350 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4724351 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4724352 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4724353 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4724354 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4724355 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4724356 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4724357 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4724358 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4724359 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4724360 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4724361 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue
4724362 wed been through several inspections theyre all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were several spectators from various divisions especially leaders from the politburo who gave the opinion it must change
4724363 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4724364 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4724365 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4724366 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
4724367 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste
4724368 that papers are biased useless as far as most things are concerned but not sourav
4724369 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4724370 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4724371 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4724372 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4724373 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4724374 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4724375 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4724376 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4724377 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4724378 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4724379 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4724380 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4724381 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4724382 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4724383 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4724384 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4724385 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4724386 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4724387 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4724388 strongly supports access to comprehensive and age appropriate sex education
4724389 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4724390 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4724391 i could either obstruct the pavement alongside a very busy road or face the prospect of never having my bins emptied again it makes you wonder what all our hard earned money is used for
4724392 of binmen says rubbish bin too far refuses to clear bin
4724393 i was fourth in the qualification with a score of 580
4724394 i was sure that i had a chance to win with this score though it is not my personal best 583 is
4724395 its my focus to try again at age 51 its a very good feeling to get medals
4724396 i think i can speak for all the athletes that we all shot pretty bad
4724397 as sometimes happens after searching the country we found our new middle school head in our own backyard
4724398 motoko has been at the in oxford michigan for seven years and is currently the co head of the middle school the school is small and has earned a reputation for innovation and close attention to its students the program of the school particularly embraces the natural environment and the ecology of the 145 acre campus
4724399 we have arrested more than eight people in connection with the serial bomb blasts in ahmedabad
4724400 the setcast collection is the result of a close collaboration between voonwong amp bensonsaw and one of chinas most distinguished manufacturers of bone china asianera based in tangshan the porcelain capital of northern china together the companies have developed a collection that makes the best use of bone chinas excellent light reflective properties and also moves away from traditional decorative tableware to focus on striking new typologies that make a bold statement
4724401 i just dont understand why in a town that was brought so much by the pageant people are willing to just forget such a legendary piece of atlantic city history
4724402 do we forget the rat pack when we talk about atlantic city history and remove frank dean and sammy from everything just because they eventually moved to las vegas
4724403 that pageant kept this town alive during some lean times she deserves more respect than that
4724404 we have a mix but thats normal in our community
4724405 its what we signed up for what we trained for what we know
4724406 the relief workers were all smiles the whole time we were there
4724407 its there as soon as you arrive you see the reaction right away the gratification the relief workers super happy its one of the perks
4724408 but we didnt anticipate anything happening russia would not interfere with a humanitarian mission there was a low threat but there was always the unknown
4724409 briefed about possible threats in georgia we werent really worried
4724410 if there is a natural disaster or conflict we anticipate a call to the unit to go somewhere a c 17 will be involved one way or another
4724411 knows the aviation world because she was a flight attendant she understands but its hard being away from family
4724412 these people are giving the drug dealers a reason to be there
4724413 mad dog doesnt need him hes going to be fine
4724414 when kittens joy went by me i just watched he was so good
4724415 that was fun to watch hes one of the best grass horses ive seen in a long time hes an amazing horse hes a phenomenal horse
4724416 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
4724417 la voix de fran ois hollande en fin de mandat et contest en interne nest plus aussi cout e par les socialistes
4724418 it is important for our men and women fighting overseas to have the best training possible and warren grove is an integral location for their preparation
4724419 however this training needs to take into account the safety of the new jersey residents living close to the warren grove range
4724420 he was a trooper i was a trooper so we made a special arrangement to do this
4724421 absent evidence that bryant was able to employ hermione grangers timeturner device the limits of time and space mean that every additional job bryant took on reduced his ability to perform his duties at the other jobs
4724422 condescendingly dismissing the imagined defense response as the stuff of a childrens book the government appears to have lost sight of the gravity attending a federal indictment
4724423 is necessary to show how much time effort and political capital bryant was willing to expend in order to increase his pension benefits
4724424 now that the court has dismissed that charge the government boldly plans to argue that sen bryants rutgers job was so demanding as to preclude other work
4724425 youre looking at a lumberyard have you ever seen a lumberyard catch fire thats the way this building went up
4724426 if we did id certainly think about having fire protection from day one i think a lot of people will be thinking about doing that going forward
4724427 and we were worried about the older houses on nearby elm street and hector street this building probably went up within two minutes three minutes
4724428 would have burned virtually any building the wind was blowing the heat in that direction but i will tell you and this is very reassuring to me that those buildings did exactly what they were supposed to do in a fire situation
4724429 if you watch how those buildings burned they burned from the top down
4724430 and that was the way that was designed so in effect the codes worked very very well
4724431 a good feature to ensure the fire wont go from roof to roof
4724432 my hope is that this will be a serious wake up call for better construction methods
4724433 seeing all these three to four story brick veneered wood framed residential buildings including assisted living facilities one wonders how safe they are
4724434 lives in brenham now where hes a morning news talk show host in radio
4724435 for a decade after the soviet union collapse the united states reigned supreme as the sole victor of the cold war washington was in the position to force the rest of the world to adopt its ideology of democracy those that did not lost economic support and faced isolation american power might not have waned but it is facing challenges from the resurgence of the east china india and russia challenges that have not been the primary focus of the state department as the united states grapples with the problem of islamic extremism mr putin is convinced that a multi polar world is being born and that russia is firmly placed to establish itself as a leading power in it moscows support of countries that follow an autocratic philosophy similar to mr putins are therefore being assiduously courted as has been shown in recent un vetoes by russia on resolutions condemning or imposing sanctions on zimbabwe and burma mr putin sees the possibility of great dividends in a battle between democracy and autocracy but even though he mourned the collapse of the soviet union as the greatest geo political tragedy of the 20th century he realizes that the new era will not be shaped by two competing powers alone with russia china and the european union in the frame he believes that instead of the cold war the new political era will be dominated by concepts such as the balance of power and the creation of alliances in other words the diplomacy of the 19th century not the 20th
4724436 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4724437 for the first time since 1991 russia has used military force against a sovereign state in the post soviet area the world will not be the same a new phenomenon is unfolding in front or our eyes a re emerging power that is willing to use force to guarantee its interests the west does not know how to respond
4724438 the georgia crisis shows that russia is in the process of testing how far it can go
4724439 this is part of a much bigger geopolitical game it is time for the europeans to decide what kind of influence it wants in the former soviet states that is the biggest strategic challenge the e u now faces
4724440 the crisis in georgia has clear implications for regional security and of course ukraine
4724441 this crisis makes crystal clear that the security vacuums that have existed in the post soviet space remain dangerous
4724442 eta asume tres atentados realizados en hernani zarautz y orio contra empresas de las que remarca su implicaci n en las obras del tav

4724444 were optimistic that the benefit of creating a foundation of 1 billion or more and the benefits that that can provide the underserved population in other words the good that that can do will be easily understood
4724445 california is a great example of a process that led to the establishment of charitable assets that are now being used productively to provide health care
4724446 the emphasis will go from patients and employers right to the shareholders
4724447 youve got to have the right products and those products have to be priced competitively
4724448 can someone do anything to get the dog out and see if shes alive
4724449 i put her in her crate right before the fire
4724450 we have a lot of hope that she survived the fire and that its still possible to get her back
4724451 i concluded that this was an appropriate disposition in this case
4724452 people who needed to get assistance from the red cross probably already got it
4724453 my main frustration is that everything changes its a very fluid situation
4724454 it really gives you a sense of what people go through
4724455 its a little overwhelming when you write a list of stuff you need when youve lost everything
4724456 joe im on my way to see ricky can you come hes worse
4724457 todd im the only one here i have the late show and then the midnights the last movie doesnt let out until almost 3am i have to lock up
4724458 joe i cant be here im freaking out do you know we walked right in there without a mask on
4724459 i think the mask is more for him than us so if
4724460 oh well we just wanted to drop off a present for him
4724461 because i am in there all the time i saw at close range about five times just to hear madonnas song in it
4724462 yes same day same year i was born exactly at midnight and my mother always said i could have august 15th or august 16th for my birthday it was my choice and for the longest time i had it on august 15th cuz thats julia childs birthday and shes a chef and im a chef and she was like my idol when i was little such a fag right anyway when madonna came out and i found out her birthday i was all thats it im august 16th from now on
4724463 well the hospital just told me ricky died around midnight last night
4724464 oh no did you get in to see him before
4724465 no his sister and mother were there so i just left without going in
4724466 so did they give you a time of death for ricky
4724467 well today is his birthday and its madonnas birthday and i just heard that shes number one today and it would be you know sorta nice if it was today
4724468 what the fuck is nice about dying on your birthday
4724469 it may or may not be the same suspect responsible for all three of the sexual assaults
4724470 we felt it important to notify the public through the media of these sexual assaults
4724471 it was a lot of hard work and it took us four years to get there
4724472 it was almost as if i announced we had a death in the family
4724473 i always joke that were chemists in a chemistry lab we tweak things and if something doesnt work we throw it out and try something different
4724474 we want people that want to teach they enjoy working with children and theyre always willing to develop and try new things we pick and choose people who would work well with our team
4724475 we didnt really spend a whole lot of time on that
4724476 we went in with our game plan and we worked with it
4724477 we want to surpass this years scores we have the momentum
4724478 the pennhurst story was and continues to be about failing to recognize the worth of people and places that whether we like or it not defines us
4724479 and all of a sudden one day we told them you cant do that anymore
4724480 people really believed that people with mental retardation had no feelings so they werent bothered by being naked in a room with 100 other naked people
4724481 its really odd what we are able to justify once we divorce ourselves from people
4724482 when we dehumanize and write off a segment of our society and render them non people we can get away with a lot of horrible things
4724483 it is a problem if we dont recall the mistakes we made as a society
4724484 in my judgment the state was derelict in letting this go on for decades
4724485 it might be far easier for a developer to retrofit and not tear them down
4724486 a restored pennhurst campus holds tremendous promise economically and environmentally that far outweighs those to be gained by tearing everything down and throwing up houses or a big box store
4724487 its part of our job to make sure people know what they have and what they stand to lose
4724488 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4724489 be careful how you think your life is shaped by your thoughts

4724491 in the far future i imagine the possibility to search and schedule recordings this is not that important to me as mythweb really does a good job
4724492 yo no soy narco no soy terrorista soy un muchacho trabajador
4724493 ho da dirti qualcosa e te la dico a modo mio
4724494 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4724495 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4724496 the first thing that pops into your head is that its bigfoot
4724497 one of the curious trends of recent years has been the western business communitys enduring love affair with the unlovely russia
4724498 harga pupuknya naik sangat luar biasa volume tetap salah satunya disebabkan kenaikan harga gas dan bahan baku lain untuk pupuk nonurea
4724499 subsidi pupuk naik bukan karena volumenya tapi karena harganya yang naik kenaikan harga pupuk urea bisa 3 4 kali lipat
4724500 saat ini pabrik urea hanya satu dan bahan bakunya dari luar indonesia semua karena itu solusinya kita akan kembangkan pupuk organik di mana petani bisa menyediakan sendiri dan kita beri fasilitas untuk pembuatan pupuk organik
4724501 weeding away flab or removing non performers from their rolls
4724502 we have not sacked anybody as an organization we work on a performance improvement plan which comes in cycles i dont have the exact number of people who have been asked to leave but i can tell you it is around 250 or less and that too this has happened over the past few months
4724503 in chennai alone the poor performers maybe a handful less than five
4724504 elimination due to poor performance is a natural process all this while we had allowed these people to stay on but since our ramco virtual works platform a technology platform is maturi ng and since productivity levels are increasing we have cut flab our annual appraisal happens between april and july and the bottom 7 of employees have been shown the door
4724505 we have asked 20 trainees to leave they were all freshers who were not upto the mark none of whom we have asked to leave are in the middle or senior management
4724506 it is still a fraction but the good news is that the industry is getting serious of cutting flab
4724507 what you do not want done to yourself do not do to others
4724508 if you create actions to bring suffering to others you shall harvest suffering on yourself
4724509 the so called golden rule is found in negative form in rabbinic judaism and also in hinduism buddhism and confucianism it occurred in various forms in greek and roman ethical teaching jesus stated it in positive form
4724510 dont pay me back im looking for nothing in return pay it forward find three other people and do something for them
4724511 therefore whatever you want men to do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
4724512 this time yeshua is directly quoting hillel the grandfather of gamliel who taught paul babylonian talmud shabat 31a what is hateful to you do it not unto others this is the entire torah and the rest is commentary yes we can actually thank the pharisees for the golden rule that we all teach our children
4724513 this is the sum of duty do naught to others which if done to thee would cause thee pain
4724514 no one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself
4724515 he should not wish for others that which he doth not wish for himself nor promise that which he doth not fulfill
4724516 do not that to thy neighbor that thou wouldst not suffer from him
4724517 what you do not want others to do to you do not do to others
4724518 do not do unto others what angers you if done to you by others
4724519 i am prepared to be received as a proselyte on the condition that you teach me the whole law while i am standing on one leg
4724520 what is hateful to yourself do to no other that is the whole law and the rest is commentary go and learn
4724521 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
4724522 ask not what you can do for your country ask what your country can do for you
4724523 do not do to others what you dont want done to you
4724524 do to others what you would have them do to you
4724525 what a great man he never stole he never lied he never lusted he never once lashed out in anger
4724526 sure but on the other hand he never gave sacrificially never once complimented anyone never offered a shoulder to cry on and never ever said thank you
4724527 do not do to others what you dont want done
4724528 do to others what you would have them do to you
4724529 im not going to get upset over someone elses life i just worry about myself first
4724530 look beyond the negative form of the rule be positive in your approach to godliness do to others what youd want done
4724531 therefore whatever you want men to do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
4724532 for with what judgment you judge you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured back to you
4724533 if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him
4724534 therefore whatever you want men to do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
4724535 but i say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you 45
4724536 therefore you shall be perfect just as your father in heaven is perfect
4724537 and walk in love as christ has loved us and gave himself for us
4724538 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
4724539 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
4724540 to show oneself useful to act benevolently to be kind or good
4724541 as you are kind so will you be shown kindness
4724542 you may be sorry that you spoke sorry you stayed or went sorry you won or lost sorry you thought the worst sorry so much was spent but as you go through life youll find youre never sorry you were kind
4724543 and just as you want men to do to you you also do to them likewise
4724544 to show oneself useful to act benevolently to be kind or good
4724545 i received an e mail from colleen the other day and that made my day a little brighter to know that some one else was thinking about me and praying for me as well
4724546 why are we to do unto others as we would have them do unto us
4724547 on these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets
4724548 if you meet your enemys ox or his donkey going astray you shall surely bring it back to him again
4724549 if there is among you a poor man of your brethren within any of the gates in your land which the lord your god is giving you you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother 8
4724550 whatever you want men to do to you do also to them
4724551 thus says the lord of hosts execute true justice show mercy and compassion everyone to his brother
4724552 but they refused to heed shrugged their shoulders and stopped their ears so that they could not hear
4724553 yes they made their hearts like flint refusing to hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets
4724554 therefore it happened that just as he proclaimed and they would not hear so they called out and i would not listen
4724555 whatever you want men to do to you do also to them
4724556 therefore whatever you want men to do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
4724557 t o que me tienes harto que yo me como a dios por una pata que t no sabes con qui n te juegas los cuartos

4724560 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4724561 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4724562 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4724563 sospech algo cuando me encontr la primera ave en gab n ya que sus caracter sticas no coinciden con ninguna de las descripciones de especies en las gu as de campo
4724564 this book works on so many different levels as a research narrative as a story of the policy of multiculturalism in australia as an account of a struggle to interpret cultural differences as an ethnography of a school dealing with profound demographic changes and as an interpretation of how change occurs and re shapes not only people but also institutions

4724566 el parque vive un momento crucial para su existencia la mayor a de las poblaciones animales a excepci n del rinoceronte blanco del que no se puede asegurar su supervivencia pueden salvarse todav a s lo depende del grado de protecci n que tengan a partir de ahora
4724567 si los rinocerontes aparecen una soluci n ser a cruzarlos con los que hay en dos zool gicos en la rep blica checa y san diego ee uu o con rinocerontes blancos surafricanos creo que es mejor tener un rinoceronte h brido que nada si no aparecen tenemos material gen tico suyo conservado en sur frica y quiz podr an clonarse como pretende la universidad de edimburgo como ltima soluci n no lo veo mal aunque si me dan a elegir entre gastar un mont n de dinero en protegerlos o clonarlos yo opto por la protecci n me parece un poco triste que los ni os acaben conociendo a los animales en los parques tem ticos o cibern ticos
4724568 lo primero es salvar el parque y darlo a conocer que la gente vuelva a o r hablar de garamba
4724569 me parece algo normal a todo te acostumbras claro que con los hipop tamos hay que tener cuidado porque cuando salen a pastar por la noche son peligrosos cargan cuando menos te lo esperas
4724570 no creo que encontremos ejemplares si acaso uno o dos
4724571 aunque encontremos los cinco ser an insuficientes para recuperar la especie creo que el rinoceronte blanco del norte de frica est muerto
4724572 se debi actuar hace cinco a os cuando todav a quedaban 35 rinocerontes y era posible hacer algo
4724573 aunque hay que ser realistas por lo menos habr a que cruzar 10 para tener xito
4724574 aunque entonces no tuvo xito creo que es una buena idea
4724575 desde hace 50 a os han perdido mucho h bitat en toda frica primero fueron las guerras luego los safaris los pu os de las dagas de los millonarios yemen es y ahora los f rmacos chinos en estos momentos hay en china mucho dinero y muchos chinos en frica que son un peligro para los elefantes y rinocerontes
4724576 ahora mismo si no disminuye su n mero vamos bien el paso siguiente es tenerlas muy controladas lo bueno es que el h bitat del parque no est desapareciendo porque est protegido si logramos erradicar a los furtivos la jirafa se recuperar lo importante es que se sepa su situaci n
4724577 me gustan m s los rinocerontes negros son muy combativos
4724578 intent subirme a un rbol pero me embisti con el cuerno
4724579 hay que tener instinto de rastreador a veces cuando sigues una huella y el animal est cerca lo sientes
4724580 en general caminan en l nea recta pero llega un momento en que empiezan a hacer eses y a moverse sin sentido porque buscan comida entonces es cuando hay que tener m s cuidado pueden estar muy cerca de ti
4724581 con o sin rinocerontes ste es un parque magn fico un espacio salvaje de una belleza incre ble dif cil de encontrar ya en frica y con una fauna y flora variad simas tiene agua todo el a o lo cruzan dos r os el garamba y el dungu afluentes y zonas pantanosas
4724582 y una poblaci n de chimpanc s bastante desconocida y a la que deber a de prestarse m s protecci n
4724583 desde guilas marciales y volatineras hasta el ibis sagrado pasando por los coloristas abejarucos escarlata o de garganta roja y el enorme gran c lao
4724584 algunos parques africanos apenas tienen animales pero eso no impide que la gente quiera visitarlos porque son enormes reas de naturaleza intocadas garamba adem s de los rinocerontes blancos hipop tamos elefantes y leones tiene muchas especies a conservar y es bueno que haya fondos para hacerlo incluso si se pierden los rinos porque su naturaleza es de una gran belleza
4724585 porque frica no va a cambiar en bastantes a os
4724586 en el congo todos los parques funcionan con ayuda internacional no hay fondos del estado
4724587 es mucho m s natural y ecol gico pasear en elefantes que en todoterreno puedes atravesar los r os y los hipop tamos no se molestan ya se hace en otros parques africanos y nadie se rasga las vestiduras
4724588 el tener una buena red de pistas resulta fundamental para la seguridad el turismo y los estudios que queremos hacer
4724589 de vez en cuando todav a hay furtivos que matan alg n ant lope o b falo pero en general el furtivismo ha descendido bastante el verdadero problema es la guerrilla la lra ugandesa que cuando se topa con los guardas tira a matar
4724590 ha sido lo m s duro lo peor de mi trabajo en frica
4724591 es absurdo dan fondos para todo menos para que los vigilantes defiendan su vida no tiene sentido pero acabamos de sumar 50 guardas a los 137 que ten amos
4724592 el problema principal de estos pa ses es que a veces piensan que la cooperaci n internacional se tiene que encargar de todo pretenden que te conviertas en estado que hagas de polic a de m dico de maestro de obras p blicas yo no quiero ocuparme de la c rcel de furtivos una herencia de tiempos pasados de la seguridad tiene que ocuparse el gobierno congole o el otro d a cogieron a un paramilitar que hab a matado un elefante para quitarle los colmillos lo trajeron aqu y por la noche se presentaron sus colegas armados hasta los dientes a sacarle del calabozo los guardas est n aqu para vigilar la naturaleza pero no para jugarse la vida tontamente
4724593 para intentar cambiar la mentalidad de mi pa s siempre eran los hombres los que hac an este trabajo y quise tener la valent a de dar ejemplo a otras mujeres
4724594 al contrario est n contentos nuestro salario es igual que el de los hombres y nos consideran como a ellos no me importar a quedarme as 30 a os
4724595 estuve tres a os de centinela de patrulla pero cuando hubo problemas con los rebeldes decidieron que me quedara a cargo de la armer a
4724596 si hay furtivos no dudar en utilizar las armas me gusta el parque y quiero defenderlo
4724597 sabemos que es un buen trabajo todos creemos en la importancia para la regi n de un buen parque con muchos animales
4724598 ahora las mujeres son m s fuertes y din micas que los hombres pueden hacer patrulla lo mismo que nosotros sin perturbar al grupo ni ser un problema para la familia
4724599 si en europa hay mujeres militares por qu no en el congo
4724600 conozco bien el medio y me gusta es dif cil vivir aqu sin buenas escuelas comercios o tel fono pero es importante tener una estructura capaz de hacer una medicina b sica porque estamos en una provincia subdesarrollada no hay cerca hospitales y las carreteras son malas
4724601 hay mucha promiscuidad sexual y tenemos un nivel alto de sida en los poblados y en el parque hombres y mujeres son promiscuos y nadie quiere usar preservativos aunque los regalamos se niegan a aceptar el problema
4724602 tener un buen centro de salud es necesario para los habitantes de la zona y para los turistas
4724603 en la campa a de recuento de 2006 hab amos trabajado 15 d as sin ver ni un rinoceronte y el ltimo d a en la ltima hora cuando ya no esper bamos nada sali uno
4724604 tenemos un margen hasta diciembre cuando pasen las lluvias seguiremos rastreando por tierra y aire con la avioneta y el ultraligero y si para entonces no aparece alg n rinoceronte los daremos por extinguidos no podemos pasarnos la vida persiguiendo algo que quiz ya no existe

4724621 this convention successfully captured ocas accomplishments of the past 35 years and kicked off the next 35 years of advocacy and service to the apa community because we partnered with some of the great leaders of the social justice and business communities and provided a forum for our communities voices for progress to be heard
4724622 how to make your first million from entrepreneur to ceo
4724623 i think i recognize you from your photo on the
4724624 sono terrorizzato da te e vorrei che mi lasciassi stare
4724625 i miei amici non hanno visto la vera india e non ci stiamo incontrando in una conferenza nel cuore della vera india
4724626 let me take this opportunity to apologize as an uruguayan because that imperialist punishment for the crime of protecting the workers and products of the nation was inflicted through three neighboring countries of paraguay
4724627 and exterminated the entire adult male population of this country
4724628 that model was misnamed free trade which as we know well is a freedom that imprisons people a big lie because thats the name that the global north gives to everything that it preaches but doesnt practice
4724629 i think all who are at this table are for liberation and for me who comes from that theology this is an extremely happy moment
4724630 is to practice not so much theology as liberation because what matters to god is not theology it is the concrete liberation of individuals
4724631 the pressure of the poor has given a very powerful force to a government that realizes the dreams denied for so many generations
4724632 we are celebrating the rise to power of one more liberator of latin america
4724633 a few days ago i was in bolivia and there i saw a miracle an indian president of bolivia now i have seen another miracle here too a bishop president
4724634 people say dont be close to ch vez or evo im not afraid of ch vez im not afraid of evo im not afraid of anyone latin america is living a different moment
4724635 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4724636 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4724637 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4724638 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4724639 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4724640 this form of division order is the new model form division order adopted by the national association of division order analysts nadoa in september 1995 and approved by the national association of royalty owners naro in october 1995 this instrument should not be altered in any way unless accompanied by documents supporting the change
4724641 if you claim the interest as shown please execute this division order in accordance with the following instructions 1 sign you name exactly as shown on the division order
4724642 because of pests and diseases that affected the hog industry
4724643 high fuel costs and the typhoons and natural calamities that occurred during the period
4724644 it is too early to make a call on the third quarter figures
4724645 that means we are keeping the 4 5 5 5 growth target for now
4724646 the liberals will therefore legislate to bring in a requirement that elections be held in february or march every four years
4724647 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4724648 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4724649 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4724650 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4724651 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4724652 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4724653 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
4724654 i am pleased to report that with the online courses help i scored a 94 percent on the recreational pilot written exam
4724655 i definitely feel that i received my moneys worth with this course
4724656 with the built in tracking functions of the course we are able to assure students proficiency when we issue the sign off
4724657 this was our goal for thenog when we started the group in may
4724658 our position on the thielert creditors committee dramatically increases our ability to bring value to our members
4724659 through our advocacy on the creditors committee and our legal standing with the german insolvency court we can accelerate the process of bringing relief to owners of aircraft that use thielert engines
4724660 but getting a suitable person with the right qualities and the right experience is the hard part
4724661 it is tough coming in at this stage of the season even for players of the highest quality asking them to come in and make a difference
4724662 with the icc champions trophy and an australian a tour somewhere too a lot of the best players are all taken up so the likelihood is well just go ahead with the good young players weve got coming through
4724663 weve got a group of young bowlers onions and davies plunkett so weve got plenty of those guys
4724664 i am still pretty hopeful and certainly a lot more hopeful than i was last year when no one was talking about me
4724665 its a good place to be though just out of the side because everyone thinks you are a better player than what you are
4724666 i think i am hungrier for england success now and certainly my point of view is different
4724667 ive always wanted to play for england but it was test cricket as the be all and end all
4724668 but through captaincy at kent and given we have been a successful side i have become hungrier to play every form of the game for england
4724669 i feel a better player now than i was when i was selected originally
4724670 looking back i probably played a bit too early at 23 if i dont play for england between now and the end of my career i will probably have a regret that i didnt do it when i was perhaps best suited to it
4724671 every big game weve had he has stood up and played an innings
4724672 when i was a young guy i used to look at carl hooper and think it would be good if hoops could have an innings today
4724673 whereas joe thinks this is about me today im going to win the game for kent
4724674 we always hear about temperament these young guys who are picked for england what have they done in big games
4724675 that is what i would be looking at how has he fared against the best bowling attack how has he done against steve harmison at durham
4724676 he played brilliantly in the semi final and scored a hundred at a time when harmison was bowling so well we could not believe he was not in the england team
4724677 we have had a number of outstanding individual performances from a lot of different players which have won us games on numerous occasions
4724678 guys are very clear on their roles and have been very focused on executing their skills the other thing is that momentum plays a huge part in one day cricket and when you keep winning it becomes a habit
4724679 the guys were extremely disappointed that we didnt play our best cricket on twenty20 finals day which is a shame because we wanted to express ourselves on that big stage
4724680 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4724681 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4724682 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4724683 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4724684 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4724685 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars
4724686 this was our goal for thenog when we started the group in may
4724687 completely refute the ridiculous claims of management that the pilots have enacted a sick in
4724688 as in any other profession employees get sick and are permitted to stay home to recover any reputable company respects the need for sick time without making unwarranted and absurd accusations that the employees are conspiring against the company
4724689 management has responded to the self inflicted shortage of pilots by discarding contractual obligations and harassing any pilot who calls in sick or fatigued
4724690 the remaining pilots are flying longer hours with shorter rest periods and many are feeling the physical strain
4724691 nonetheless the company subsequently issued a harassing notice of investigation to the pilot in reaction to his sick call
4724692 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4724693 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4724694 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4724695 these missiles have been used by the russians tactically for psychological and military targets as the georgians do not have the capability to defend against or defeat ballistic missiles
4724696 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet bloc especially poland
4724697 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
4724698 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminals its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
4724699 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theater and at that time the specific brigade tactical uav elements actually fly the missions
4724700 the brigades route the aircraft back into our air space and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
4724701 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
4724702 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
4724703 keeping soldiers safe on the battlefield is no 1 this is definitely a technology that will always be part of the fight
4724704 with the predicted technician shortage and a general decline in interest in aviation with high school and college graduates this aviation career day is being organized as a long term effort to reverse this trend
4724705 our goal is to educate students about all of the unique career opportunities in aviation and pique their interest in our industry
4724706 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the e gaming photographic images field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of e gaming photographic images related experience
4724707 after next weeks pre release editions go out we expect to see a mad dash for bookstores on the 20th when the general release of the e gaming photographic images book takes place
4724708 and that will mean big sales long hours and lots of money
4724709 well be releasing the final version of our e gaming photographic images study this evening
4724710 which will make the twilight hours at the local book shops very interesting
4724711 ive been working within the e gaming photographic images field for years and never before have i seen better work out of prof kitzmiller lebowitz
4724712 but im proud i was able to be part of such a distinguished research team
4724713 im happy prof fagg hardridge invited me to join the team
4724714 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
4724715 its a tough world out there for employment within the e gaming photographic images sector
4724716 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
4724717 im absolutely floored by the honesty integrity and thouroughness of this cornerstone e gaming photographic images work
4724718 and i have already sent a nomination to the board for the writing medal its this kind of brilliance that really helps the world at large
4724719 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
4724720 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
4724721 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
4724722 as i remember it seemed to me that there was a porn site on the computer
4724723 hell this is country music the last time i checked
4724724 i have a bad habit of saying things during shows that i really regret
4724725 if i start talking too much something bad is gonna come out of it my initials after all are b s
4724726 were just kind of sitting here waiting to see what they feel is i dont know what they can come up with
4724727 why she was out probably had nothing to do with this anyway
4724728 she was in the wrong place at the wrong time
4724729 this office is committed to transparency as it relates to the rebuild iowa office
4724730 decisions that are made out of the public eye breed suspicion by citizens
4724731 i would hate for you to take something thats a draft and print it as if its the final document because its not
4724732 people will have a lot more confidence in his final decisions in the groups final decisions if they feel fully confident that they understand how those decisions evolved and what citizens and experts recommended in the first place
4724733 when you come down from the campground in the morning and you look down and see no sidewalk only heads thats when you know
4724734 and the weather has been awesome thats the biggest help
4724735 my husband said i was there just to sign some documents because some banks need the wifes signature on them
4724736 does not allege mrs boesen engaged or devised the acts
4724737 as a matter of corporate policy employees must use our systems and not personal e mail
4724738 i dont know how long i can stay in the house i have no income
4724739 ed was at work all the time and he took care of the work part of it
4724740 deans passing leaves a huge hole in the fabric of drake university in central iowa and in our hearts
4724741 he was always one to spend a lot of time with his students and kept in touch
4724742 politics in the human interest applying sociology in the real world
4724743 there was nothing laying around the house i assumed everything was blown away
4724744 this is the second thing hell have gotten back from the tornado
4724745 found by michael mcclain when planting corn in the john mcclain field between westgate and sumner
4724746 my priority is supporting our men and women in uniform and ensuring their safety
4724747 i believe every service member and their families must be served by their country with the same dedication and honor with which they have served our nation
4724748 if you weigh the considerations of not doing it for anybody or doing it for everybody so you help the flood victims i would opt on the side for the waiver

4724851 we saw the fight tonight and thats what we needed to see
4724852 overall the scrimmage was much better than last week so im tickled right now because i think weve gotten better weve still got a long way to go but the defense was great
4724853 hidden valleys got a very good football team were doing a good job of tackling a good job of coverage
4724854 when you scrimmage good people that prepares you to play
4724855 we didnt really prepare for them we just told our kids wed have to start adjusting on the run we practiced several things to do that
4724856 i was pleased with our execution joel elswick the blues quarterback made some good decisions
4724857 we made a couple of mistakes they got us with the screen and we laid the ball down but theyve got a lot of athletes we knew that theyre the preseason no 2 team in the state in double a
4724858 so we knew we had our hands full but we saw a lot of good things tonight in that first half
4724859 we adjusted well we made a couple of mistakes we missed a tackle and weve got to come up a little quicker but those are things that can be fixed
4724860 you come up here and play a team like we played just now and you see how far youve come and how far youve got to go to be able to compete with the best in the state
4724861 one heck of an athlete i know he got calls today from uva west virginia and virginia tech i knew they had a good athlete at quarterback
4724862 youve got to practice against those type of kids that type of speed we dont see that type of speed much and you put him on a fast track like mitchell stadium is now youve got to adjust on the run
4724863 one play that we ran tonight we have not been able to run for a year and we were able to run it tonight for a lot of yards thats a great plus for our offense because that opens up so many other things
4724864 defensively weve just got to wrap up come up a little bit quicker and fill the alley just a little bit quicker
4724865 id like to get the winning tradition back here to narrows
4724866 i just want to get things going the right way for the guys coming up this year
4724867 it was two years ago but that is too long though
4724868 thats why were looking forward to getting back and doing weve been doing what we used to do and thats what were looking to do
4724869 im really excited practice has been high paced quick and weve been doing good
4724870 we just had a scrimmage last saturday and we did really great in it
4724871 im just looking forward to my senior year and going out on a good note and hopefully we can leave something for the juniors coming up so they can have a good season next year
4724872 we started getting a little confidence there toward the end of the year and really built up some momentum and ended up winning two out of three
4724873 that really propelled some things and its carried over to the beginning of this year as far as working and everything is building off of that
4724874 weve got a strong backfield this year i mean it is powerful and weve got a powerful line this year
4724875 the backs are going to come on hard on our backs and follow us and well lead them corey had a good year last year hopefully hell build off of that
4724876 josh has worked extremely hard in the weight room this summer and he has gotten stronger
4724877 were looking for him to anchor both the offensive and defensive lines for us
4724878 he is a great kid a very coachable kid anything we ask him to do he does it all out and hes a good solid leader for us
4724879 i have no clue what got me into football it just the love of the game
4724880 that doesnt bother me i just love doing what i do
4724881 that was pretty emotional we came out and just smacked them in the mouth
4724882 we had a good opening drive and then we just lost everything
4724883 but we just like taking one game at a time
4724884 when i was a little kid i loved to watch them play
4724885 the fans will come up to you on the weekends and say you played good on friday night or just hoping you can win
4724886 thats the main thing and hopefully those wins will come theyll thank us for the wins
4724887 just keep practicing real hard like we have been and listen to our coaches and just do what were coached
4724888 were trying to get everything back on a winning pace hopefully we can do that

4724890 the neon pink screen of death will still offer users absolutely no explanation as to why their machines have died when trying to use them and we think the new colour will significantly reduce incidents of people throwing their laptops out of tenth floor windows because its such a nice colour and ignorance continues to be bliss

4724892 the answer is simple enough you get an individually numbered box for the twelve installer dvds made out of top quality non recyclable plastic the promise of additional downloadable extras that may or may not materialise and the satisfaction of knowing youve spent the most out of anyone willing to give us another chance after vista you cant put a price on feeling superior can you
4724893 also weve already had angelina jolie and brad pitt and madonna get in touch with us keen to find out if windows 7 will run their adoption databases to allow them to plan for the future expansion of their families by harvesting differently coloured wide eyed poor children from around the world we told them were not sure windows 7 will be able to manage databases that large but never say never

4724923 i was able to save par on the third hole then chipped in on 15 but the key to my round was hitting it close on almost every hole
4724924 ive spent only one weekend away from golf all summer and im playing pretty well
4724925 i havent played a lot in recent weeks so im satisfied with my round
4724926 my goal is to play well enough to have a chance on sunday
4724927 the course is in great shape its a very fair test
4724928 it was a combination of some bad breaks and some bad shots

4724932 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4724933 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4724934 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4724935 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races

4724940 fired by groups that dont really understand the importance of this
4724941 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
4724942 its about more than who gets to the finish line first
4724943 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4724944 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4724945 from that point on we really had some solid at bats and we were able to string some things together
4724946 el marcador dice que yo puse la mano en el muro primero
4724947 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude
4724948 yo sab a que no estaba tan detr s de cavic como en la eliminatoria cuando cort la ltima brazada pens que me costar a la carrera pero fue justamente lo contrario si yo me hubiera deslizado no habr a ido tan lejos hice dos r pidas brazadas cortas para intentar llegar y tocar el muro al final tome la decisi n correcta
4724949 vi la carrera despu s en la pantalla gigante y la vi a c mara lenta imagen a imagen en la c mara de masaje en el ordenador
4724950 esto demuestra que no importa lo que pongas en tu imaginaci n que cualquier cosa puede pasar sue a tanto como puedas so ar y cualquier cosa ser posible
4724951 algunas personas dec an que esto ser a imposible y no pasar a esto muestra que cualquier cosa puede suceder antes de que yo fuera a entrenar con bob bowman entrenador del equipo de los estados unidos es el nico que realmente me ayud a querer so ar acerca de cualquier cosa
4724952 yo quer a ser un atleta profesional y s quer a ganar medallas ol mpicas pero l es el nico que me dijo que so ara que so ara tanto como pudiera finalmente ha ocurrido el duro trabajo que bob y yo hemos realizado juntos nos ha dado sus frutos
4724953 yo sab a que ten a que estar a medio cuerpo de distancia de crocker ian estadounidense yo corro mucho contra l tengo la capacidad de saber d nde necesito estar en los 50 metros para ganar si tengo medio cuerpo s que esta bien cuando vi a crocker en el giro sab a que cavic estar a en alguna parte con l yo pod a ver algo de l de reojo
4724954 ya lo he dicho antes y lo seguir diciendo mi meta principal es cambiar el deporte de la nataci n por los chicos que vienen a este deporte y por el deporte en am rica
4724955 as que dijo mi meta se est empezando a cumplir pero me queda un largo camino todav a
4724956 creo que bob y yo podemos pensar en m s objetivos en los pr ximos cuatro a os
4724957 one of the first times that i saw her when she was awake in the icu she was asking me why i wasnt coaching the team
4724958 thats a testament to the support and the importance she places on what were doing here we talked about it fairly extensively
4724959 a lot of hugs and then we just got on and got through the scouting report on china and watched video we tried to keep it as business like and as routine as possible
4724960 last night he was there at the village we had a video meeting talked about the game plan and to be honest i thought it may be a little stranger but it kind of felt like we didnt skip a beat
4724961 i wouldve been quite happy to get on the plane with them but we had some unfinished business here
4724962 she was extremely encouraging she was adamant that i stay she assured me shes going to be good weve had a week here to grieve together and ive been trying to do my best to help her through this very difficult process but shes a strong woman and shes in a good place right now to be with her family and to get on with the next phase of this thing
4724963 i actually went over to the new zealand part of the village last night just to say thanks
4724964 its a little bit humbling but also very reassuring to know that your mates are your mates
4724965 i told the guys through our team leader that if they needed me for anything volleyball related they should call me
4724966 i think that theres some comfort or something in just getting back into the normal rhythm of how i deal with my players
4724967 when im here im here and im giving it everything ive got when im not with the team i have to go and kind of recharge my batteries and get ready for the next round im confident that ill be able to do that otherwise i wouldnt be here

4724978 i am a very shy girl so you can not see me without clothes during my private show feel free to chat with me about anything but do not expect any nudity from me
4724979 i m absolutely fond of gentle and tender guys who will respect me first then will be able to keeps talkings
4724980 es muy posible que a partir de 2008 los hinchas visitantes puedan volver al ascenso ya estuvimos hablando con daniel scioli y la gente del coprosede porque sin p blico visitante no se puede jugar
4724981 el problema no son las banderas ni los bombos de los hinchas sino que hay que evitar que los violentos ingresen a las canchas con rev lveres y con otras cosas m s
4724982 a la cancha salen once jugadores y algunos planteles tienen 33 jugadores por eso digo que hay que ponerle tope a los contratos a europa habr a que vender televisi n y no a los mejores jugadores aunque s que es dif cil
4724983 el f tbol es un caldo para la violencia por toda la gente que va pero la violencia est en todos lados y es algo que se incorpora al f tbol
4724984 la idea es que los clubes vendan dos jugadores por a o y dedicar esa plata a aumentar el sueldo para el resto del plantel el dinero de las transferencias no tiene que servir para cubrir la gimnasia o la pileta a esas actividades las abona el socio con su cuota
4724985 queremos que en todas las canchas la gente mire los partidos sentado va a ser dif cil implementarlo pero vamos a empezar vendiendo entradas como si el p blico estuviera sentado de esta forma vamos a achicar la capacidad de los estadios
4724986 me ofrecieron la pol tica diez mil veces pero no acept porque hay que sentarse a arreglar cosas y sa no es mi caracter stica lo crean o no lo crean
4724987 les dejo a los dos las puertas abiertas de la afa porque se lo merecen por todo lo que hicieron
4724988 es un tema muy importante y lamentablemente tenemos que esperar hasta 2014 hace poco renegociamos el porcentaje y conseguimos pasar de 90 a 180 millones de d lares pero vamos a pedir m s porque es poco
4724989 era un ne fito en el tema cuando se firm el contrato la primera vez
4724990 pero ahora manejo los contratos de tv de la fifa y conozco del tema entonces vamos a hablar mano a mano nos vamos a poner firmes pagan tanto y listo de lo contrario llamaremos a una licitaci n
4724991 el tema es que no hay muchos con la capacidad para poder llevar adelante semejante emprendimiento y hay que ver si todos los que pueden hacerlo en realidad quieren
4724992 boca ten a confianza en m y yo tambi n l stima que no anot al jugador en la lista preliminar de 30 ni en la posterior de 23
4724993 boca lo podr a haber anotado aunque no fuera jugador de ellos
4724994 tendr an que haber hecho como hizo rosario central en el caso del kily christian gonz lez que anot al jugador para el certamen local y no lo habilit despu s siguieron negociando y pudo actuar dos meses despu s en el apertura ya que hab a sido su nico club en el a o
4724995 no s si trataron de presionar pero aunque lo hagan la fifa no les da pelota
4724996 si de los clubes europeos se siguen llevando a los pibes desde muy chiquitos vamos a volver al amateurismo
4724997 ahora el problema es m s grave porque los clubes de afuera ya tienen gente ac establecida buscando chicos en todo el pa s para llev rselos a europa
4724998 as como existen tribunales laborales y penales necesitamos que se conforme uno deportivo que ayudar a a frenar ese flujo de chicos para afuera
4724999 lo que habr a que hacer es retener a los jugadores el mayor tiempo posible y venderle a los europeos los derechos de televisi n no que nosotros tengamos que ver a nuestras figuras s lo cuando juegan barcelona o real madrid
4725000 eso es muy dif cil de hacer m s si los representantes le dicen a los jugadores que no renueven contrato y as poder irse a europa o cuando los padres son comprados por los clubes europeos
4725001 lo primero que pens al terminar el partido de arsenal y am rica fue que no hay hombres imprescindibles y que arsenal no necesit de m para poder ganar un t tulo
4725002 estoy como en un mundo de ensue o a veces debo pellizcarme para asegurarme de que es real estoy feliz de estar en el mundo real
4725003 cuando di ese manotazo en la ltima brazada pens que me hab a costado la carrera pero en realidad fue lo contrario si me hubiera deslizado habr a sido demasiado largo termin adoptando la decisi n acertada una cent sima es el margen m s peque o de victoria en el deporte es muy bueno es todo lo que puedo decir
4725004 bob me dec a que so ara en grande que cualquier cosa puede ocurrir esto realmente demuestra que no importa en qu ponga uno su imaginaci n puede concretarlo no importa cu n grande sea el sue o todo es posible
4725005 no alcanzar la mayor a absoluta supondr a para m supondr a lo mismo que para cualquier gallego que crea que las cosas se pueden hacer mejor una mala noticia
4725006 tengo recuerdos de la infancia saltando por una chopera y perseguida por los vecinos
4725007 no merec a la pena entr en la recta final y vi que iba 9 02 y que pod a llegar sobre 9 20 lo importante era no forzar no gastar un m nimo de fuerza y clasificarme que era lo que quer a
4725008 veremos el domingo que ser una carrera a ritmo m s r pido a ver c mo paso la r a
4725009 lo veo con mucha preocupaci n porque veo a la gente muy fina yo tambi n lo estoy pero hay que esperar que alguna de ellas caiga
4725010 el objetivo es que las piernas funcionen que han funcionado que llegue bien que he llegado y que las fuerzas aguanten para estar ah
4725011 la r a me ha roto el alma no s ni por d nde he salido
4725012 mi objetivo ya est cumplido pero voy a dar todo lo que me quede el domingo
4725013 pensaba que las rusas iban a venir con un poco de miedo despu s de lo del 1 500 pero nada ah est n
4725014 nos va a ganar una medalla solamente hay que verla c mo corre y los ltimos entrenamientos que ha hecho
4725015 por desgracia despu s de lo que ha pasado es improbable que los osetios y los abjasios vayan a poder vivir en un estado junto con los georgianos
4725016 despu s de esta firma todas las unidades rusas deben marcharse de georgia
4725017 expresar la solidaridad y respaldar la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia y a su gobierno
4725018 la osce enviar a sus observadores dentro de varios d as
4725019 la soberan a de georgia sobre abjasia y osetia del sur es inapelable
4725020 its definitely going to be the most exciting final weve had in a very long time in the mens 100
4725021 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted then youre going to mess up
4725022 is the competition is getting tired during the rounds and im working the kinks out each round im getting faster and each round theyre getting slower i dont know if thats necessarily the truth but thats what i tell myself
4725023 the naval academy was a great place i loved my time there i had a blast it really just came down to this is a dream ive had to play professional baseball
4725024 i decided this was the perfect time to pursue it
4725025 i have put in my papers to leave the navy i was released from the academy like three weeks ago and ill get my official honorable discharge papers probably in a couple of more weeks
4725026 we talked through the whole process and they were very supportive of me pursuing my dream and all so it was good
4725027 you go into the game its just a little later
4725028 youre just trying to help out the starter who just pitched his butt off and did real well and also have some success yourself
4725029 it seems like it was the organizations idea whenever i can get innings im happy
4725030 once i got on the mound it was just like pitching anywhere else
4725031 youre stepping on the mound playing baseball the competitions great in the appalachian league every day you pretty much go out there with high expectations
4725032 my dad always loved the game i just kind of fell in love with it at an early age
4725033 we went to fenway park a lot watched red sox games a lot we had a good time with that
4725034 the academics were tough there so i was used to that going in to the naval academy i lived away from home all through high school
4725035 the naval academy its a whole nother world it takes a lot of getting used to but it was definitely a good experience
4725036 we played real good competition we had excellent coaching and had a real good team
4725037 i really didnt have any expectations whether i was going to be drafted or not drafted
4725038 when my name got called it was an exciting time
4725039 i have no clue thats not for me to decide i just go out there and try to do my best and see wherever the organization feels that i fit into their system
4725040 rendez donc c sar ce qui est c sar et dieu ce qui est dieu

4725064 it was 3am on thursday when i heard a bang then the man from room four shouted down saying somebody had been shooting at him through his window
4725065 there are six holes in the window really big holes so it was obviously a powerful rifle
4725066 we think the shots were fired from a car park across the road the a596
4725067 i rang them back at 10am and they said that theyd tried to call me but the phone was engaged
4725068 you could understand it if this had been a minor incident
4725069 im appalled at the lack of police response any incident involving guns has to be considered serious and deserving of an emergency response
4725070 a lot of people are asking what we are getting back in return for the tax we pay
4725071 the officers said they knocked on doors and windows and there was no response
4725072 il ny a pas de minorit francophone en flandre il y a des immigrants qui doivent sadapter

4725075 no fue una sorpresa para los norteamericanos mijail saakashvili no es un presidente independiente sus tropas son casi estadounidenses al igual que su armamento sus instructores
4725076 el objetivo de estados unidos era empujar a rusia a una respuesta militar lo escandaloso no es la actuaci n de rusia sino la de estados unidos
4725077 expresar la solidaridad y respaldar la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia y a su gobierno
4725078 si nuestras tropas de paz y nuestros ciudadanos son atacados responderemos en el futuro tal como respondimos
4725079 estamos contabilizando unas dos mil personas que integran la bolsa de trabajo 2005 2007 pero muy probablemente algunos ya tengan plazas por el examen de oposici n o tal vez porque el sindicato les haya ofrecido una plaza interina es decir muchos de los dos mil maestros no est n desempleados muchos de ellos ya han de estar integrados a los talleres generales de actualizaci n desde el pasado mi rcoles para empezar el nuevo ciclo escolar
4725080 esta es la respuesta institucional en el sentido de que la bolsa de trabajo sigue vigente que nos va a servir para cubrir las necesidades de los maestros la primera necesidad que tenemos en puerta es el otorgamiento de interinatos a la brevedad posible muchos maestros el pr ximo lunes ya estar n dando clases
4725081 estuve revisando las listas en internet pero no pude saber si pas o no as que mejor me vine de irapuato a guanajuato y todav a no s
4725082 en telesecundaria la mejor evaluaci n fue de 73 aciertos yo pienso que cuando muchos mis aciertos equivocados fueron 10 o cuando mucho 15 pero no aparezco en las listas
4725083 este fue un proceso que present irregularidades ya que desde la inscripci n el portal de inscripci n se saturaba no se pod a acceder
4725084 no est n considerando la antig edad de quienes tenemos bastante tiempo solicitando una plaza es injusto que las autoridades se est n basado en un examen
4725085 no nos parece c mo se dio el examen nacional creo que me fue bien pero ya no creemos en las autoridades porque si ya nos hab an evaluado anteriormente no se vale que ahora nos descarten
4725086 el examen estuvo f cil pero mi problema es que estoy en bolsa de trabajo desde 2006 as que no se me hace justo que est otra vez en bolsa de trabajo
4725087 yo no quisiera desvirtuar el objetivo del examen el examen era para que los maestros que tengan las plazas sean los mejores de un examen tengo entendido que se cumpli y los mejores ser n los asignados a las plazas que se tienen en guanajuato
4725088 yo creo que es posible y creo que este primer examen es punto de partida para clarificar y dar las plazas a los mejores
4725089 we go through an on the road type of situation for future road games
4725090 they need to know how to act because when we go on a road trip with west virginia university its a business trip it isnt a pleasure seeking joy ride we go to get ready for our football game and its really cool that our administration lets us do that
4725091 they wont act right if you dont teach them so we start from the ground floor
4725092 no creo que se vaya a tomar una gran decisi n bas ndose en un fax medio en el que lleg el alto el fuego firmado por georgia
4725093 i think some juvenile leftists have taken over the obama campaign and gotten a hold of photoshop
4725094 now im getting death threats and hate mail from obama supporters
4725095 youre getting these death threats because you wrote a book
4725096 and in fact theres a website daily kos thats published your home address
4725097 det har undret mig s re at eu proj ektet som jeg synes er genialt er blevet solgt s d rligt det m vi have gjort noget ved
4725098 poseemos cerca de la mitad de la riqueza mundial nuestra tarea principal consiste en el pr ximo per odo en dise ar sistemas de relaciones que nos permitan mantener esta posici n de disparidad sin ning n detrimento positivo de nuestra seguridad nacional

4725100 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
4725101 according to our system any individual accused of sodomy can clear his name the islamic way or through the courts and saiful has chosen the former it is up to the people to make their own conclusions
4725102 i have said from the beginning that this issue is a personal matter between saiful and anwar and has nothing to do with the barisan nasional
4725103 the terrorists exploit and use the poor people for their objectives
4725104 as they couldnt settle down in assam so they have settled down in bangladesh they are living in the lap of the luxury and have forgotten what life they have given to the assam and how the people of assam are still living now so sitting there they are dictating certain terms and conditions which doesnt apply in the present situation for the assamese people
4725105 bangladeshi has come in without any fear of getting detected they are being utilized by the ulfa sitting there to find out what is going in assam and give them the feedback
4725106 its very difficult to understand baruah i dont know whether he is really concerned for the people of assam or not no doubt they are doing something sitting in bangladesh as newspaper reports say but things have changed assam has changed technology has come and what we know is that they should respect the sentiments of the people
4725107 i dont appreciate the killings i feel we end up killing our own people who are like our own kith and kin so there can be no benefit from such cruel murder ulfa has deteriorated and is corrupt it has become cruel that is why people dont support the ulfa any more
4725108 the ulfa was established for the peace and development of the people of the state if they are killing the people it is not good and it is injustice the outfit cannot survive and even if the government does this it will also face the problem
4725109 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4725110 people who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink red bull in future
4725111 india should not take her success for granted it is a fact that china is behind us in high end outsourcing but china is a quick learner they are investing heavily in education i think we should now make efforts to ensure that not only seven cities which are leaders in it sectors but if we can build 50 cities including places like ludhiana amritsar chandigarh then i dont see any reason why we cant continue to succeed as we have population as well as capability
4725112 as far as development of human capital is concerned chandigarh administration has already started development of educational city where we have planned to have high end courses the criteria for designing the courses have been identified selection of partners for the educational city has already been entrusted to a committee of eminent experts in this domain so we have already selected partners for phase 1 2 and third phase is in process
4725113 if we do nothing then seven leading cities it cities will move from 2mn employment to 6mn but if we do something which really promotes these destinations then may be the 2mn jobs will become 5mn but 3mn job then can be created in smaller cities which means indirect jobs of 1 to 1 5 crores which is fantastic achievement so it is nasscomms efforts to make sure that we promote other cities encourage reveres migration then i think we can solve the problem
4725114 hemos venido a crear paz a incrementar la separaci n entre las fuerzas y para detener no la guerra entre nuestras fuerzas armadas y georgia pero s entre georgia y los civiles osetas tambi n para detener la guerra entre ladrones
4725115 gran preocupaci n ahora tenemos un rea cada vez mayor de territorios ocupados por rusia
4725116 right to play was founded on the idea that every child should have the right to play and that when children play the world wins
4725117 with our extensive roster of athlete ambassadors from over 40 countries we wanted to tap into the power of the games to connect people in support of our programs that bring sport and play to children all over the world we are delighted that lenovo has joined us in this effort to raise funds
4725118 lenovo wants to create new ways to help fans experience these olympic games
4725119 the right to play olympic memorabilia auction is a great way to make connections between fans and athletes athletes are supporting a worthwhile cause inspiring fans to do the same thing and giving them a chance to own a piece of olympic history
4725120 i had the opportunity to experience what right to play does first hand when i visited liberia in 2007
4725121 i was so moved by the positive impact that right to play programs had on children and their communities being around these children and seeing the difference that sport can make in their lives was a life changing event i hope that as 2008 olympians we will rise to the challenge and make some valuable contributions to this great initiative
4725122 like the olympic games right to play and lenovo are dedicated to putting teamwork and sportsmanship into action
4725123 theyre using the olympic games as a platform to do some really great work the auction is a worthwhile cause that im happy to be a part of dont miss your chance to bid now

4725183 i was told that foley had focused on clearing the speech for sources and methods rather than for substance
4725184 in other words as long as the language didnt give away any secrets about how the intelligence was collected they didnt worry about whether we believed the assertions in the speech were accurate that was a terrible mistake our job was never to clear solely for sources and methods but also for substance and the last time i looked as good as the british intelligence service is and it is very good it does not work for the president of the united states

4725377 president robert mugabe yesterday friday met his south african counterpart president thabo mbeki to discuss the possibility of finalising a political settlement among zimbabwes political parties ahead of the southern african development community summit of heads of state and government
4725378 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4725379 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4725380 im going to ask them questions about character competence about values vision virtue about their convictions in leadership about their experience and im going to deal with their personal life because character matters their personal life does matter as a leader god says so
4725381 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4725382 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4725383 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4725384 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4725385 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah
4725386 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4725387 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4725388 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4725389 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4725390 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4725391 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4725392 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4725393 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4725394 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4725395 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4725396 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4725397 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4725398 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4725399 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4725400 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4725401 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4725402 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4725403 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4725404 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4725405 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4725406 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4725407 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4725408 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4725409 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4725410 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4725411 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4725412 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4725413 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4725414 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4725415 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4725416 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4725417 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4725418 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4725419 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4725420 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4725421 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4725422 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4725423 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4725424 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4725425 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4725426 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4725427 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4725428 we at everton like to be at the cutting edge of mobile phone technology and the launch of evertonbluetooth r is proof of such
4725429 about the work that bluepod were doing in the stadiums of blackburn rovers birmingham city west ham portsmouth wigan athletic wolves and celtic

4725433 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4725434 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4725435 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4725436 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4725437 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4725438 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4725439 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4725440 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4725441 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4725442 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4725443 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4725444 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4725445 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4725446 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4725447 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom

4725449 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4725450 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4725451 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4725452 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes

4725455 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4725456 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4725457 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4725458 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4725459 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4725460 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4725461 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4725462 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4725463 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4725464 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4725465 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4725466 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4725467 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4725468 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4725469 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4725470 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4725471 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4725472 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4725473 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4725474 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4725475 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4725476 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4725477 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4725478 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4725479 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4725480 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4725481 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4725482 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4725483 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4725484 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4725485 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4725486 les n gociations continuent et se poursuivront jusqu ce quune solution soit trouv e
4725487 elles se poursuivront parce que la sadc la communaut de d veloppement dafrique australe dont le sommet souvre samedi ne peut pas se permettre de tourner le dos
4725488 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4725489 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4725490 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4725491 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4725492 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4725493 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4725494 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4725495 what do you want your look to say to people
4725496 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4725497 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4725498 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4725499 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4725500 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4725501 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4725502 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4725503 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4725504 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4725505 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4725506 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4725507 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4725508 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4725509 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4725510 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4725511 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4725512 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4725513 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4725514 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4725515 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4725516 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4725517 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4725518 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4725519 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4725520 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4725521 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4725522 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4725523 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4725524 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4725525 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4725526 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4725527 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4725528 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4725529 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4725530 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4725531 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4725532 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4725533 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4725534 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4725535 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4725536 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4725537 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4725538 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4725539 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4725540 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4725541 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4725542 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4725543 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4725544 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4725545 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4725546 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4725547 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4725548 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4725549 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4725550 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4725551 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4725552 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4725553 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4725554 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4725555 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4725556 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4725557 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4725558 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4725559 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4725560 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4725561 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4725562 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4725563 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4725564 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4725565 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4725566 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4725567 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4725568 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4725569 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4725570 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4725571 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4725572 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4725573 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4725574 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4725575 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4725576 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4725577 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4725578 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4725579 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4725580 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4725581 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4725582 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4725583 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4725584 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4725585 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4725586 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4725587 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4725588 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4725589 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4725590 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4725591 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4725592 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4725593 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4725594 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4725595 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4725596 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4725597 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4725598 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4725599 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4725600 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4725601 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4725602 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4725603 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4725604 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4725605 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4725606 ils ont cr un p rim tre sous leur contr le autour de gori
4725607 que sont ils en train de faire on ne sait jamais ce que les russes sont en train de faire

4725611 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4725612 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4725613 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4725614 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4725615 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4725616 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4725617 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4725618 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4725619 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4725620 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4725621 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4725622 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4725623 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4725624 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4725625 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4725626 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4725627 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4725628 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4725629 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4725630 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4725631 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4725632 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4725633 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4725634 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4725635 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4725636 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4725637 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4725638 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore

4725641 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4725642 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4725643 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4725644 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4725645 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4725646 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4725647 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4725648 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4725649 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4725650 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4725651 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4725652 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4725653 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4725654 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4725655 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4725656 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4725657 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4725658 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4725659 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4725660 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4725661 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4725662 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4725663 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4725664 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4725665 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4725666 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4725667 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4725668 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4725669 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4725670 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
4725671 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4725672 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4725673 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4725674 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4725675 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4725676 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4725677 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
4725678 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
4725679 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4725680 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4725681 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
4725682 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
4725683 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
4725684 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
4725685 jongens waren we maar aardige jongens al zeg ik t zelf we zijn nu veel wijzer stakkerig wijs zijn we behalve bavink die mal geworden is wat hebben we al niet willen opknappen we zouden hun wel eens laten zien hoe t moest

4725690 and also the best too i dont know why you men always ask the same old ridiculous questions
4725691 we can come off the water knowing we had a great race
4725692 we tried to ignore the fact that we hadnt had a medal yet as a country and tried to focus on our two kilometres
4725693 we have got to fight it with everything weve got
4725694 put simply we cannot let the liberals take this country back to the tax and spend policies of the past
4725695 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4725696 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4725697 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4725698 i see mr dion has been threatening to defeat the government again this summer i am starting to feel like i am starring alongside bill murray in the movie groundhog day
4725699 as humorous as mr dions behaviour has been this spectacle of his threatening to defeat the government then backing down has to end
4725700 i am starting to feel like i am starring alongside bill murray in the movie groundhog day
4725701 at least dion is trying to do something for the environment
4725702 you dont allow cancer to grow you cut it out before it kills you
4725703 there is a cancer growing in this country and it is called marxist leftism which has found a willing home in the democratic party it is reaching its culmination in the obama campaign pray to god they are defeated by the ballot which will make the bullet unnecessary
4725704 i have never seen things more clearly than i do right now the time for compromising with evil is over it is time to destroy it before it destroys me my family and our liberty
4725705 there are some things worth fighting for dying for and yes killing for it is better for one man to die than for a whole nation to perish
4725706 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4725707 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4725708 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4725709 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4725710 toxoplasma affects fear of cat odors with almost surgical precision
4725711 an initial visit to the homeopath can take from 1 to 1 and a half hours because homeopaths treat the person rather than the illness the practitioner interviews the person at length asking many questions and observing personality traits as well as unusual behavioral and physical symptoms determining the persons condition also includes a physical examination and possibly laboratory work
4725712 what is a normal ph level for a regular person and then what is a normal ph level for someone who takes the medications i do
4725713 oh you are taking a lot of medications what are these for

4725718 see this banana fits my hand perfectly therefore all my crazy religious beliefs must be true
4725719 do you believe that all creatures past the very first life were born from other creatures
4725720 any particular person believing a weird thing is not necessarily stupid
4725721 if you think it has to be basic intelligence it doesnt
4725722 this i think is why creationists are not necessarily stupid and why i wouldnt assume it
4725723 the problem isnt basic intelligence as michael shermer points out smart people can believe weird or dumb things and the smarter they are the better they are at defending them
4725724 how can we expect reason from them when so many of us cant grasp basic logic
4725725 fallacy of affirmation of the consequent just because smart people can believe weird things that doesnt mean that any particular person believing a weird thing is smart
4725726 i was trying to say that because smart people can believe dumb things that means smart people can believe dumb things
4725727 a top manager will always make a difference and weve got a top manager again a
4725728 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him
4725729 he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4725730 and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4725731 i think its fair to say that the importance of the ethics training was highlighted by the audit findings and issues
4725732 some activities may be legal but they may not pass the smell test avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest or commitment can be a bit tricky the easiest way to stay out of a trouble spot is to ask yourself would i want to read about this in the newspaper or online
4725733 to get people thinking about all of the ramifications of a questionable act
4725734 people are shown what answers they got right wrong as they go through each scenario so they can assess their learning
4725735 trying to get away with as much as possible and disclose as little as possible dynes who has already completed the course said in his video introduction that it is important for all employees to have a common frame of reference on ethics

4725766 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4725767 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4725768 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4725769 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4725770 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4725771 a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4725772 right now their actions have been inconsistent with the premise that we and those in europe and around the world have inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4725807 i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm
4725808 our club has never been a willing participant in talking about anything to do with draft picks and we never will be
4725809 thats a disgraceful thing to ask for past coaches of the game to get involved in talking about it i think its a disgrace
4725810 i understand theres people out there that may think that way but its a massive reflection on them
4725811 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4725812 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4725813 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4725814 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4725815 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4725816 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4725817 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4725818 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4725819 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4725820 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4725821 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4725822 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4725823 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4725824 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4725825 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4725826 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4725828 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4725829 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4725830 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4725831 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4725832 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4725833 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4725834 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4725835 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4725836 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4725837 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4725838 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4725839 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4725840 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4725841 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4725842 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4725843 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4725844 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4725845 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4725846 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4725847 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4725848 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4725849 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4725850 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4725851 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4725852 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4725853 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4725854 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4725855 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4725856 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4725857 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4725858 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4725859 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4725860 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4725861 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4725862 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4725863 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4725864 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4725865 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4725866 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4725867 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4725868 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4725869 who are open to doing something on the production side
4725870 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4725871 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4725872 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4725873 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4725874 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4725875 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4725876 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4725877 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4725878 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4725879 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4725880 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4725881 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4725882 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4725883 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4725884 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4725885 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4725886 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4725887 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4725888 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4725889 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4725890 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4725891 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4725892 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4725893 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4725894 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4725895 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4725896 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4725897 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4725898 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4725899 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4725900 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4725901 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4725902 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4725903 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4725904 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4725905 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4725906 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4725907 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4725908 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4725912 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4725913 i am so moved by the villagers who came out so early in the morning to show their support

4725915 i know anwar well we have been friends and i look forward to taking him on
4725916 permatang pauh is in the eyes of the world now it is their voters destiny to put anwar on track to become the next prime minister
4725917 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament
4725918 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4725919 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honored
4725920 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4725921 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4725922 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4725923 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4725924 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4725925 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its territory
4725926 a top manager will always make a difference and weve got a top manager again a

4725928 he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4725929 and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4725930 i wondered what i was going to say at this monumental time when it would happen and who i would say it to and of course i thought i was going to say it to phelps for some time now
4725931 but the word comes to mind epic what you did tonight was epic and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are
4725932 you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years and i know that you will wear the crown well
4725933 you werent born when i did what i did and im sure that i was a part of your inspiration and i take that as a full compliment
4725934 and they say that you judge ones character by the company you keep and im happy to keep company with you
4725935 i never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention because i watched you at athens win the race by similar margins and 18 months at the world championships by similar margins
4725936 that is a tribute to your greatness and now the whole world knows
4725937 theres going to be a lot more olympics in my future
4725938 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal

4725960 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4725961 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4725962 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4725963 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been

4725976 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system
4725977 my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4725978 i modeled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions
4725979 i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes

4725995 kalau kita menyerang mereka bererti kita melakukan pembunuhan dalam bulan haram ini menunjukkan bahwa kita tidak menghormati bulan haram seluruh bangsa arab tentu akan mencela dan memusuhi kita tapi kalau kita biarkan mereka sampai bulan haram ini berlalu pastilah mereka sudah sampai ke tanah haram makkah menyerang mereka tetap dilarang sebab mereka sudah berada di dalam wilayah tanah haram mereka akan aman dari kita
4725996 demi allah aku tidak memerintahkan kalian untuk berperang melainkan untuk mendapatkan berita tentang orang orang quraisy hanya mengintip gerak geri mereka tidak lain

4726051 the cable before it failed allowed only one transmission at a time and wasnt replaced until 1866 when a better cable of higher quality was laid
4726052 it wasnt until the invention in 1874 of the quadruplex that two messages could be transmitted concurrently

4726059 valencia ist ein neuer austragungsort im kalender und deshalb eine besondere herausforderung auch weil es sich um einen stadtkurs handelt
4726060 allerdings keinen langsamen denn die piloten werden an der schnellsten stelle ber 300 stundenkilometer erreichen mit hilfe unserer simulationsprogramme sind wir in der lage das abtriebslevel also die aero konfiguration sowie die belastung f r die bremsen und die gang bersetzungen zuverl ssig vorauszuberechnen damit wir mit einer guten basisabstimmung beginnen k nnen
4726061 wenn man valencia mit monaco vergleicht hat man es zwar mit zwei stadtkursen zu tun die allerdings deutlich unterschiedliche charaktere haben und andere anforderungen an das fahrzeug stellen
4726062 in valencia werden wir mit hohem abtrieb antreten aber nicht mit maximalem downforce wie in monaco

4726066 the need of the hour was to bring children closer to each other hindu kids must go to their muslim friend at least on occasions like eid and muslim children must enter hindu friend house on diwali there is total absence of information and knowledge about each other the need is to cross that boundary and try to know each other
4726067 no i dont think so people and professionals out there are all concerned worried and feel pain of it but many of them feel helpless while some have no clue as to how to go about helping and some choose to be quiet rather than to do anything but pain is felt by all in our country

4726081 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4726082 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4726083 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4726084 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4726085 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4726110 we are definitely going to miss bakkies hes a special player
4726111 i think bakkies plays in his coach gavin hunt won his first premier league title last season with supersport and knowing the sweet taste of victory the cape town born coach will want roads and stormwater eddie chinnappen said a bus system had proved to be the most efficient and cost effective system for cape town and one that could bloomberg 16 hours ago been fairly good

4726114 i love him i hate him why did he have to leave whyd he have to leave us why the fuck did he join the army he doesnt love me he loves me he cares he doesnt care
4726115 your dad has hated that man for along time hes never said anything nice about him
4726116 a hard life makes you stronger and an easy life makes you weak
4726117 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned

4726119 mccain sides with bush on torture again supports veto of anti waterboarding bill
4726120 black claims mccains campaign is above lobbyist influence i dont know what the criticism is
4726121 mccain very honored by support of pastor preaching end time confrontation with iran
4726122 john mccain gets a zero rating for his environmental record
4726123 you are still gonna be cool right i mean youre not gonna be as boring as mom
4726124 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4726125 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4726126 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at
4726127 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of
4726128 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of
4726129 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and
4726130 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4726131 keane has been training really well really hard but he will need time to get used to his team mates and torres
4726132 but i have no problems with him he can play up front with torres or in behind it will depend on the game
4726133 you might be surprised whats going to happen in the next two days
4726134 improvement maybe will come in different ways for ronaldo next season 42 goals is a target again
4726135 its not impossible for him to achieve it given the mentality of the boy and his goalscoring abilities but its a big target for him
4726136 what you will see is improvement in his authority and his decision making which improves with experience experience gives better timing all these things
4726137 he never misses a session morning or afternoon its terrific were penciling in the beginning of october for his return
4726138 india should not take her success for granted it is a fact that china is behind us in high end outsourcing but china is a quick learner they are investing heavily in education i think we should now make efforts to ensure that not only seven cities which are leaders in it sectors but if we can build 50 cities including places like ludhiana amritsar chandigarh then i dont see any reason why we cant continue to succeed as we have population as well as capability
4726139 as far as development of human capital is concerned chandigarh administration has already started development of educational city where we have planned to have high end courses the criteria for designing the courses have been identified selection of partners for the educational city has already been entrusted to a committee of eminent experts in this domain so we have already selected partners for phase 1 2 and third phase is in process
4726140 if we do nothing then seven leading cities it cities will move from 2mn employment to 6mn but if we do something which really promotes these destinations then may be the 2mn jobs will become 5mn but 3mn job then can be created in smaller cities which means indirect jobs of 1 to 1 5 crores which is fantastic achievement so it is nasscomms efforts to make sure that we promote other cities encourage reveres migration then i think we can solve the problem
4726141 the idea is to put on the field to play our game in a way that is as similar as brazilian football as we can but i have players who are made for english football their characteristics are different
4726142 we will try to learn about dribbling controlling the ball passing the ball touching the ball and one twos but i need to respect the identity of the players and the quality of the players we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others dont
4726143 but they need to understand that sometimes it is difficult to play beautifully and win sometimes it is impossible because the other team plays a different style
4726144 i therefore paul a prisoner for the lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all huility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
4726145 if you only come to one dy show a year then come to this one but this time we mean it
4726146 a top manager will always make a difference and weve got a top manager again a world cup winner and a great football man
4726147 tactically he is very aware and when he talks everyone listens he has that aura about him
4726148 he doesnt speak very often but when he does he gets the attention of everyone we needed that
4726149 he also has that fear factor we havent really seen that side of him yet but im sure we will
4726150 and when he occasionally raises his voice you think oh there it is
4726151 you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
4726152 lightly directed improvisations moving from the terrifying to the sublime
4726153 if only i were canadian i could leave early too
4726154 some people have been watching and the chinese do about 10 times more warmups than everyone else
4726155 they do their first attempted weight in the snatch and the clean and jerk three times in the back in warm up before going out front which is definitely not something most athletes can do because its pretty taxing
4726156 i am so happy that we dont have any positive cases but we will have more weight classes to go so let me say i am praying every day
4726157 instead of joining a travel agency ive decided to take up a job at this age going to and fro its better to start on my own whatever little i can do
4726158 this course gives them the skill to do something on their own it helps them to build their self confidence it helps them to network with other people
4726159 if you look at women they form almost half of the gender population but if you look at their representation in terms of the workforce in terms of entrepreneurial activity that seems to be extremely low so if theres a way by which we can integrate or promote women into the workforce and entrepreneurial activity that would improve the productivity of the economy
4726160 but its not only about the money working in the garden is satisfying for both of us we would do this even if it cost us money
4726161 i think theres a real interest in people trying to grow their own food partly because its fun partly because it tastes good and partly because it saves money
4726162 people often find out that their site doesnt work well for what they really wanted to grow

4726183 providing unsatisfactory picture quality not recording as much programming to the hard drive or to a dvd disc as advertised and taking longer to record to a dvd disc than advertised
4726184 in other words you may get better with practice at matching pictures of ice cream cones or frogs from rapidly changing images or mastering obscure facts about famous people james joyce was afraid of dogs but whether that translates into brain protection or confers benefits beyond those offered by square dancing eating blueberries or simply yukking it up with friends is anybodys guess
4726185 and despite akimbos claim to be the first digital quality video on demand service over the internet the video quality is erratic none of it is high definition none of it looks as good as a dvd and some of it has the blockiness and pixellation of a web cam one childrens series is so obviously a transfer from a vhs cassette you can actually see the white streaks of the vcrs dirty heads

4726214 clico will be pumping over 3 5m into this years event with cash prizes totalling 2 7m and the remainder being spent on other miscellaneous items such as bandannas cell phone holders and the printing of programmes for the days event
4726215 it would be remiss of me if i do not say thanks to clico for their generous support in sponsoring a day of races at the kmtc for the second time we at the kmtc are grateful to clico for this generous sponsorship
4726216 no sporting activity whether it is cricket football cycling or even horseracing can be successfully promoted without the aid of sponsorship and we are always grateful for sponsors such as clico who comes forward to do so
4726217 on a sadder note it is appalling to note that some persons in the sporting fraternity do not have a proper accountability system for sponsors money and kmtc is an exception in this area we ensure that when you the sponsors give to us any amount even if it is 20 000 we give to you an accountability record on the expenditure of same whilst at the same time show our appreciation for same in some form or the other
4726218 we do have people who have attempted to make feature films dramas and sitcoms
4726219 we are trying to stimulate an interest and to develop partnerships to give people the resources to produce films and documentaries
4726220 which properly channelled can and should provide a basis for a challenge to the hegemonies of the established international film industries
4726221 a lot of people want to get into film making but it doesnt make sense if as soon as you put something out a man on the corner is selling it for two hundred dollars
4726222 we have learned that film is an important medium for teaching for generating controversy and for stimulating thought and debate
4726223 make sure that they compete in the spirit of brotherhood
4726224 guyana is presently in the early stage of constructing an aquatic centre that will be fitted with olympic size swimming as well as diving pools
4726225 i live in the real world and how much we put into this preparation is how much we will get out of it if we plant bitter cassava we will not reap sweet potatoes however if we do all that we can do to ensure a good preparation in a professional environment i am confident that the players will rise to the occasion
4726226 in professional football the coach takes the responsibility for selection whilst the players take the responsibility for their performances especially in front of the goal but when you have three or four sessions to prepare a team for a major tournament such as this one the work is more tactical and organizational
4726227 the real technical deficiencies are worked on at the clubs on a daily basis and there is only so much work we can do on finishing in the national team i have already gotten a commitment from the players to work hard at the club level so that when we gather the national team we will also do a bit of work
4726228 the guyana national team is an ongoing process searching for the best combination we will always attempt to use the best possible team based on chemistry tactical needs and player requirements
4726229 players will be left out because we have more than 20 good players i am entrusted with that choice and no matter what the mouth murderers say i will exercise that right without fear or favour for guyana as the buck stops with me
4726230 however we have coaches watching the performance of guyanas players in trinidad and tobago england and north america with wayne dover being the man looking at those based in guyana
4726231 our aim is to have a bunch of locally based players train in guyana and monitor via the internet videos and live matches where possible those who are playing overseas

4726246 i think guyanese realize that we are genuine and really want to provide them with quality entertainment and activities that they really enjoy
4726247 but weve matured and had years of learning how to deal with our misunderstandings

4726264 la gente que trabaja en esto ya ni se toma una semana de vacaciones
4726265 la crisis se siente much simo y este trabajo no tiene promedio de facturaci n fija es como el mercado burs til
4726266 es natural cuando hay menos dinero para gastar se gasta menos
4726267 la crisis empez a notarse pr cticamente despu s de las elecciones hay muchos menos clientes y sin embargo m s se oritas que piden plaza en nuestros hoteles
4726268 el verano lo trastoca todo la gente pasa las vacaciones en la playa y muchas veces las se oritas se desplazan tambi n desde el interior de espa a detr s del cliente

4726271 peace needs to re established in the region and guaranteed and underpinned so that no one again will get idiotic ideas and this i see as the main task of the russian federation
4726272 his country will sign a cease fire accord with georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements including a troop withdrawal
4726273 we are at the early stages of this inquiry but we believe there may have been witnesses who could assist our investigation into finding out what happened
4726274 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations
4726275 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4726276 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4726277 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4726278 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4726279 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4726280 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4726281 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4726282 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4726283 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4726284 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4726285 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4726286 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4726287 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4726288 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4726289 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4726290 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4726291 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4726292 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4726293 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4726296 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4726297 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4726298 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4726299 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4726300 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4726309 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4726310 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4726311 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4726312 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4726313 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4726314 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4726315 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4726316 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4726317 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4726318 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4726319 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4726320 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4726321 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4726322 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4726323 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4726324 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4726325 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4726326 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4726327 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4726328 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4726329 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4726330 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4726331 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4726332 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4726333 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4726334 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4726335 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4726336 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4726337 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4726338 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4726347 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4726348 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4726349 i had no idea that there was a protest this is the first word i have heard of it
4726350 the timing system said it all there hasnt really ever been in an error in the timing system that i have heard of
4726351 if it was up to me i would drop the protest i didnt want to fight it its a gold medal its difficult to lose but i have to remember my goal here was bronze
4726352 if we went through this again i would win it
4726353 its hard to argue with the electronics system the problem for milorad was that his touch was too soft if the race is tight youve got to be hard on the wall
4726354 i personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4726355 it was clear from the video that it was an issue of stroking one was stroking and the other was gliding
4726356 according to our rules we used automatic timing system and in this case it was in perfect condition in perfect order and there are no doubts it provides for the competition at these olympic games
4726357 after watching the video footage i met with the serbian officials and gave them an explanation and offered them an opportunity to see the video themselves
4726358 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4726359 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4726360 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4726361 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4726362 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4726363 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4726364 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4726365 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4726366 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4726367 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4726368 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4726369 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4726370 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4726371 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4726372 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4726373 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4726374 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4726375 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4726376 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4726377 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4726378 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4726379 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4726380 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4726381 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4726382 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4726383 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4726384 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4726385 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4726386 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4726387 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4726388 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4726389 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4726390 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4726391 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4726392 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4726393 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4726394 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4726395 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4726396 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4726397 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4726398 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4726399 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4726400 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4726401 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4726402 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4726403 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4726404 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4726405 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4726406 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4726407 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4726408 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4726409 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4726410 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4726411 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4726412 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4726413 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4726414 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4726415 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4726416 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4726417 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4726418 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4726419 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4726420 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4726421 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4726482 the brakes went bad six months ago but i had them fixed i know the rotor and the cylinder on the drivers side were bad as of a day or two ago
4726483 i had to tell this poor man that his wife was dead and then i walked him down to see his son it brought a smile to his face its their first baby the family was talking about a shower
4726484 the baby will likely grow up to become a great man he comes with a blessing i thank god that he survived
4726485 i hope that he will untangle this situation as soon as possible but its his business i dont get involved

4726494 that really shocked me and had me thinking maybe i already know someone who could be affected and i dont even realise it its really opened my eyes to the suffering that people go through and what a terrible effect this illness can have on someones life
4726495 the chance to play this part came out of the blue
4726496 i was not expecting it at all but while its been an incredible opportunity for me ive also been conscious of what a responsibility it is to try to accurately portray what a young person with this illness can go through

4726507 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4726614 the development of global landmark projects like the dubai mall is a complex process that involves co ordination with project managers retail tenants and government authorities by opening on october 30 we are not only offering customers the option of several added attractions but also better public amenities such as more parking for cars and smoother access
4726615 on october 30 all public areas of the dubai mall will be open to customers at the same time creating a retail event unlike anything ever seen in the region the dubai aquarium amp discovery centre the olympic sized dubai ice rink the worlds largest indoor gold souk and hundreds of retailers will open simultaneously giving visitors several retail and leisure options
4726616 the dubai mall is expecting some 30 million customers in the very first year of trade and to support this it is important to have a smooth traffic and public service infrastructure the dubai mall will have over 14 000 car park spaces and a dedicated bridge from sheikh zayed road for direct access to the mall the dubai metro is also fast progressing and will soon add to the ease of access to the mall while other access roads are being readied to accommodate the expected record numbers
4726617 the dubai mall is already in global spotlight and it is important that it opens with maximum shopping and leisure attractions at the same time it is also crucial to have a strong supporting infrastructure which will make access in and out of the mall a smooth and stress free experience the october opening has been planned to coincide with a key retail period that immediately follows and thus will give our retailers a period abuzz with retail activity
4726618 as one of the worlds largest shopping and entertainment destinations there are several retail and leisure attractions that are currently being finalized in time for the opening this is beneficial for retailers as this allows for more time for fit out as well as for training their staff and streamlining the operational aspects the new opening date will give our valued retailers more time and opportunity to be part of the launch of the dubai mall from day one

4726691 of course of course these commercials won awards and were so memorable that customers still recall them in 1975 the company took a bold and audacious step by becoming the first bookseller in america to discount books by offering
4726692 our mission is to operate the best specialty retail business in america regardless of the product we sell because the product we sell is books our aspirations must be consistent with the promise and the ideals of the volumes which line our shelves to say that our mission exists independent of the product we sell is to demean the importance and the distinction of being booksellers as booksellers we are determined to be the very best in our business regardless of the size pedigree or inclinations of our competitors we will continue to bring our industry nuances of style and approaches to bookselling which are consistent with our evolving aspirations above all we expect to be a credit to the communities we serve a valuable resource to our customers and a place where our dedicated booksellers can grow and prosper toward this end we will not only listen to our customers and booksellers but embrace the idea that the company is at their service

4726697 there is no question that driving without insurance is both unlawful and ill advised
4726698 if you are worried about the cost of insurance it is worth talking to your insurance provider to check whether there are any savings to be made at rias for example we specialise in finding tailored insurance solutions for the over 50s who can often benefit from cheaper premiums because of low mileage or because their cars are parked off road or kept in a garage we advise customers to ensure they ask about discounts and flexible payment plans when they call us for a quote
4726699 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
4726700 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
4726701 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
4726702 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you

4726707 during the past 12 months the cost of basics such as food petrol and utility bills has dramatically increased but with household budgets feeling squeezed there is a danger that pension contributions might be delayed or suspended as people focus on the short term rather than the long term to ease the cost of everyday living however delaying your pension contributions can be very expensive

4726716 the credit crunch represents a unique challenge for organisations that need to reduce costs while at the same time increase their work force in order to grow as a business the graduate pool represents a solution
4726717 firstly candidates with experience are higher up on the career ladder so obviously have greater expectations in terms of starting salary secondly the really talented experienced candidates are usually retained by their employers who know better than to let a talented employee slip by them
4726718 while graduates expect a competitive salary and benefits what they tell us is a more important factor when considering a potential employer is that they work for a progressive company that offers long term career prospects
4726719 the challenge is to ensure new recruits are properly trained and developed obvious for graduates but also true for those with experience also
4726720 weve proven that with proper training and coaching even the most inexperienced graduate can meet and exceed the targets of even the most seasoned professional
4726721 weve always been willing to prove that our graduate recruitment and sales training process works which is why we offer to replace a candidate that is not achieving free of charge within the first twelve months of placement our 94 success rate illustrates we rarely have to do this but this is only half the story for companies who need extra reassurance weve developed a train amp invest scheme which allows employers to take on a new recruit for an eight week period while receiving full coaching support and sales training at no additional cost should they not work out this may seem crazy but illustrates the confidence that meta morphose has in the graduate talent pool for the future of uk industry

4726760 more and more of these kinds of cases are being brought to trial nationwide reflecting an increasing understanding in our criminal justice system that cruelty toward cats is not tolerated in a civil society
4726761 we applaud the henrico county commonwealths attorney office and encourage prosecutors across the country to uphold the laws which exist in all 50 states and the district of columbia that make intentionally killing a cat a criminal offense
4726762 richmond citizens should feel proud to live in such a caring city
4726763 local animal organizations have been providing free spay and neuter for feral cats and have humane programs in place like trap neuter return that meet the needs of the cats and the community
4726764 but there is still a need nationwide for education and awareness on feral cats and the cruelty and ineffectiveness of catch and kill so called animal control policies and sheltering practices need to change
4726765 catch and kill for outdoor cats does not reflect the values held by most americans

4726772 however it is important for taxpayers to be educated on the irs and their collection agencies when dealing with owed back taxes
4726773 for many individuals who owe back taxes to the irs the culprit behind the tax debt is the estimated tax payment
4726774 have you ever dealt with an irs representative who is less than helpful this is a frustrating predicament for taxpayers that just want to put their irs tax debt behind them so they can move on with their lives however it is easy to forget that the irs is staffed by human beings with all the common foibles of ordinary people even though they may not always demonstrate them openly irs representatives often allow their own emotions and personal problems to creep into their work furthermore irs employees have varying levels of competency and skill if you have been working with the irs to settle your tax liabilities and feel that you have been treated unfairly or incompetently you may want to request the assistance of the taxpayer advocate service the taxpayer advocate service tas describes itself as an independent organization within the irs the service is free but not everyone who owes back taxes will qualify for tas assistance a taxpayer normally must be experiencing some kind of economic burden or delay imposed by the irs if you believe that you fit this criteria or if you believe that an irs procedure is just not functioning properly you may want to consult with the tas by calling 1 877 777 4778 you will need to give them your basic contact information and describe to them the actions you have taken to try to resolve your tax debt if they decide that they can help you will be given a case number and you will be contacted by your assigned case advocate usually within a week or so the individual case advocate will work as a mediator between you and the irs
4726775 the internal revenue service irs has implemented procedures for taxpayers to request a reimbursement of the fees charged by a bank against a taxpayer for processing a bank levy when the bank levy was issued erroneously by the irs reimbursements are limited to 1 000 00 and must be claimed within one year of being incurred as you may know the irs has the right to issue a bank levy on an account that bears the name of a taxpayer who owes irs back taxes a notice of levy is sent to the taxpayers bank and it attaches to all accounts in the name of the taxpayer whether a sole or joint account the bank is then legally obligated to honor the irs levy that freezes the funds on deposit in the account the bank cannot allow anyone access to the frozen funds for 21 days from the date of receipt of the levy this holding period allows time to resolve any issues about account ownership and collectability after the 21 days have elapsed the bank must send the money plus interest if it applies to the irs if the levy has not been successfully released

4726778 provides a novel means for sensing the level of infrared radiation received by the vegetation from a skyward direction
4726779 infrared thermometers with bandpass filters from 8 to 13 can be used to measure the real temperature of vegetal surfaces with errors in the range of 0 1c to 0 3c to do this the emissivity must be either known or determined and a correction accounting for the reflected radiation from the surroundings must be made
4726780 the apparent radiative temperature may differ as much as 2c from the real temperature
4726781 the research clearly highlights the importance of online interaction between consumers when faced with purchasing decisions whether it is with blogs comparison sites or user reviews brands need to understand and engage with social media to survive the expected economic downturn
4726782 it is clear from this research that online strategies will have to become far more sophisticated to weather the economic slowdown a one size fits all strategy will no longer be the most effective and online retailers will have to start to segment their audience and match their marketing activity to each group

4726834 i want to be as open as it is possible to be without imposing on your time
4726835 there are currently a number of consultants who are being paid to support the transition process but it is not intended that the fees for these individuals will be made public
4726836 we do not envisage all of these consultants being here for six months some will become permanent members
4726837 european music is based on the artificial sound of the note and the tone scale it opposes the brutal and objective sonority of the world as a result of an unbreakable convention european music is obliged from the beginning to express a subjectivity it seems to fight the sonority of the outside world like a sensitive being resisting the insensitivity of the universe european civilization from the year thousand on is one of the only civilizations accompanied by a huge and dazzling history of music this civilization with its adoration of the suffering of jezus its courtly love its cult of the bourgeois family its patriotic passions shaped the sentimental man music has played an integral and decisive part in the ongoing process of sentimentalization but it can happen at a certain moment in the life of a person or of a civilization that sentimentality previously considered as a humanizing force softening the coldness of reason becomes unmasked as the supra structure of a brutality this was the moment at which music appeared to me as the ear deafening noise of the emotions while the sound world in the works of xenakis became beauty beauty purified of the dirt purified of sentimental barbary to be a prophet of insensibility joyce could remain novelist xenakis had to step out of music xenakis opposes the whole of the european history of music his point of departure is elsewhere not in an artificial sound isolated from nature in order to express a subjectivity but in an earthly objective sound in a mass of sound which does not rise from the human heart but which approaches us from the outside like raindrops or the voice of wind
4726838 art has something in the nature of an inferential mechanism which constitutes the platforms on which all theories of the mathematical physical and human sciences move about
4726839 it is truth and truth alone that can offer us access to itself
4726840 upon the anti christ allegation even when this allegation is completely ignored these days is founded the organization of the whole modern world a new era begins a dangerous time not just of episodic lying but of systematic permanent efficient and ontological lying that can no longer be perceived as such
4726841 the fact that the original essence of being and that of truth along with it lies in praxis that every true objective thought that is to say thought capable of referring itself to being and of recognizing the place of truth must recognize at the same time its fundamental incapacity to constitute by itself this place and this original essence of being and of truth the necessity in which it finds itself to appeal to something other than itself
4726842 synne is behovabil necessary but al shal be wel and al shal be wel and al manner of thyng shal be wele
4726843 god needed him for something that is why he had to die
4726844 the unity of all divided humanity is the will of god
4726845 openly contradicts the will of christ provides a stumbling block to the world and inflicts damage on the most holy cause of proclaiming the good news to every creature
4726846 many elements of sanctification and of truth can be found outside her visible structure these elements however as gifts properly belonging to the church of christ possess an inner dynamism towards catholic unity
4726847 the theologians will be the last universalists in our highly differentiated world of science and they will have to remain so whether they like it or not
4726848 the only way out of this difficulty is to postulate a beyond which is not one more difference but something which poses a threat i e negates to all the differences within that context or better that the context constitutes itself as such through the act of exclusion of something alien of a radical otherness
4726849 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
4726850 pauls unprecedented gesture consists in subtracting truth from the communitarian grasp be it that of people a city an empire a territory or a social class what is true cannot be reduced to any objective aggregate
4726851 one may also say greek and jewish discourses are both discourses of the father that is why they bind communities in a form of obedience to the cosmos the empire god or the law
4726852 it is not being circumcised or being uncircumcised that can affect anything only faith working through love
4726853 christian universality is formulated from the position of those excluded of those for whom there is no specific place within the existing order although they belong to it universality is strictly codependent with this lack of specific place determination
4726854 it proposes something that is open to everybody the division is internal to the subject itself
4726855 the global cosmic chain of being is not all there is that there is another order which suddenly emerges and which suspends the validity of the order of being
4726856 there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by jesus christ
4726857 the roots of these problems are to be found in certain presuppositions of both a philosophical and theological nature which hinder the understanding and acceptance of the revealed truth some of these can be mentioned the conviction of the elusiveness and inexpressibility of divine truth even by christian revelation relativistic attitudes toward truth itself according to which what is true for some would not be true for others
4726858 this theological position fundamentally denies the universal salvific mission of jesus christ cf acts 4 12 1 tim 2 4 6 jn 14 6 and as a consequence the mission of the church to announce and communicate the gift of christ the saviour to all humanity cf mt 28 19 mk 16 15 eph 3 8 11 both of which are given clear witness in the new testament and have always been proclaimed as the faith of the church even in recent documents
4726859 once again theologians have been caught out in their inauthentic pusillanimity in deference to liberal fashion they have foresworn christian claims to uniqueness to a transcending of the jewish legacy and so forth now they are wrong footed by marxist atheists who recall us to the facts of historical phenomenology christianity was the first enlightenment the first irruption of an absolutely universal claim
4726860 die theologen werden die letzten universalisten in unserer hochdifferenzierten wissenschaftswelt sein und sie werden es um gottes und der menschen willen bleiben m ssen gelegen oder ungelegen immer auch mit der bereitschaft einen gewissen ungleichzeitigkeitsverdacht auf sich sitzen zu lassen der theologe der nicht sich selbst und andere betr gen will der theo logie treibt und zwar nicht als dies oder das sondern als den immer neuen versuch der rede von gott ist und bleibt auf universalit t verpflichtet
4726861 paul fights against all those who would submit postevental universality to jewish particularity
4726862 to the jews i became a jew in order to win the jews to those under the law i became as one under the law though not being myself under the law that i might win those under the law i have become all things to all men
4726863 why then does one of you make himself judge over his brother and why does another among you despise his brother let us each stop passing judgement therefore on one another
4726864 give a welcome to anyone whose faith is not strong but do not get into arguments about doubtful points
4726865 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4726866 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4726867 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4726868 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4726869 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4726870 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4726871 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4726872 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4726873 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4726874 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4726875 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4726876 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4726877 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4726878 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4726879 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4726880 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4726881 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4726882 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4726883 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4726884 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4726885 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4726886 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4726887 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4726888 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4726889 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4726890 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4726891 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4726892 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4726893 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4726894 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4726895 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4726896 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4726897 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4726898 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4726899 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4726900 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4726901 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4726902 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4726903 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4726904 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4726905 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4726906 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4726907 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4726908 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4726909 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4726910 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4726911 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4726912 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4726913 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4726914 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4726915 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
4726916 one out of 12 cases is a vindictive case its not as though there is no truth but yes at times it is blown out of proportion to make the husband and the in laws look criminal and fetch them punishment accordingly
4726917 there are several cases where the husbands were earning a handsome salary and a case of dowry was slapped against them women are misguided by the family and sometimes by lawyers to extract money
4726918 even the amendment in the dowry law in the year 1993 has not brought relief to the grieving husbands instead it has created more problems for them
4726919 with the help of lie detector tests things will become easier for the complainant as well as the accused this step will be a great relief for those who are being harassed without any fault of theirs
4726920 there are instances of wives misusing the law only because they want to get away from a joint family and set up homes of their own for various reasons if a man resists the move because the parents are aged his wife goes to police with a complaint of dowry harassment
4726921 sono molto orgoglioso di mio figlio ha iniziato a lavorare comefattorino si iscritto alle serali e si diplomato dopo pochi anni diventato direttore ed oggi il presidente della compagnia e diventato cosi ricco da regalare a un suo amico che compiva gli anni una mercedessuperlusso
4726922 non posso dirvi lorgoglio che mi da il mio ha studiatoingegneria ha aperto unimpresa di costruzioni e ha fatto i miliardi lui per il compleanno di un amico gli ha regalato una villa da 1500 mq
4726923 ma quale disgrazia sta una favola pensate che questanno per il suo compleanno tre frocioni di clienti gli hanno regalato una mercedes unaereo privato e una villa di 1500 mq e i vostri figli invece che fanno
4726924 actively managing our archival data allows us to move the least used files to less expensive storage
4726925 digital objects that are frequently used remain on our high performing storage area network as a research library however we are also responsible for data curation and preservation on files that might be needed once every five ten or fifty years the maestro file manager file level assessment helps us make sure we are leveraging our storage environment most efficiently implementing a global namespace through the attune maestro will provide us automated file migrations and management of our storage and archives based on business policies and evolving best practices
4726926 the university of iowa libraries will benefit from immediate roi from our file virtualization solution with the maestro file manager by building out their tiered storage based on insights gained from our file assessment tools
4726927 understanding what files havent been accessed in over six months or which file types are consuming the bulk of their storage resources will allow the library to make improved storage management decisions and improve visibility on their storage costs
4726928 the connecting to collections bookshelf provides museums libraries and archives essential instructions on how to rescue treasures of yesteryear that they hold in trust
4726929 these bookshelves once they are all distributed will touch institutions around the nation
4726930 given the gettys longstanding commitment to the care of museum and archival collections we are pleased to partner with imls and other foundations to provide key conservation resources to the institutions that most need them
4726931 we are delighted to help make this important material reach so many institutions around the country
4726932 the kress foundation is delighted to be working with imls to ensure the broadest possible access to this important reference resource
4726933 i look forward to working with my team members liblimes library partners and the koha community to make koha an even better tool for patrons and librarians
4726934 one of the beauties of the open source model is that the user can become the developer
4726935 my goal is to help our customers participate directly in the koha project thus reinforcing the idea that libraries and their patrons should hold the true ownership of their tools
4726936 galens talent and experience have proven invaluable were very glad to see him advance to take on this new challenge
4726937 in his new role galen will be coordinating the efforts of the growing liblime development team his proven management skills and experience working on software for libraries will continue to be invaluable to liblime and our customers
4726938 we have chosen koha for one simple reason the ability to customize
4726939 our current product is adequate but lacks the functionality needed especially as we receive new grants
4726940 our current ils simply lacks the ability to run the types of reports that grantees require and the company has little interest in
4726941 there isnt a public library in utah that is running koha and we are excited to be an example for others however we lack in house programming skills cost is a huge issue for us and as i was researching options the support from liblime is very reasonable compared to paying proprietary systems for support
4726942 im delighted that liblime has decided to acquire these assets
4726943 this will ensure the continuation of these products services well into the future i look forward to seeing how liblime grows these ideas i also feel its important to say that this sale and my move is based primarily on personal reasons and is in no way a reflection on the open source community or service providers serving libraries open source has a vibrant future in libraries and im pleased to say that ex libris is one of the proprietary vendors listening to this community as evidenced by their recent announcement about their new open platform strategy i will continue to stay engaged with the library open source community albeit in a different role
4726944 weve been proud to list care affiliates as one of our strategic partners since they started supporting open source in 2007
4726945 this arrangement gives us increased capacity to deliver open source and open architecture solutions for libraries in the strategic area of metasearching
4726946 we are very excited to join the growing number of libraries making the switch to evergreen open source library software the hosting is beneficial to a small library like ours that lacks some of the resources of a larger institution
4726947 the staff will enjoy the intuitive nature of the evergreen ils its obviously written the way librarians think and is easy to navigate
4726948 hosting is an excellent option for libraries with smaller collections and limited access to technical support hosting allows our support services to be more effective and allows the library to focus on its core mission
4726949 as ebrary offers a volume of quality titles in multiple subject areas from the worlds leading publishers it is a privilege to integrate their content with knowledgeworks
4726950 at the same time ebrary offers the most compelling technology for conducting research quickly and efficiently we look forward to enhancing knowledgeworks data and our customers experience with ebrary
4726951 serials solutions is a global leader in library technology offering a complete family of solutions for e resource data access management and assessment
4726952 it is an honor to be the first e book vendor certified by serials solutions and we look forward to providing our customers with a quick and easy way to access their subscription content
4726953 we are excited to offer the institute at the reforma conference to provide resources and information for library stakeholders advocating on behalf of latino and the spanish speaking members of our communities
4726954 certainly as we continue to talk with the unions there will be movement by both sides mr caica said yesterday
4726955 im not ruling out an easing of the governments position
4726956 the 21 per cent increase to bring our pay up to the national benchmark doesnt have to be 7 per cent each year ms haythorpe said yesterday
4726957 for example if the government wanted to offer 5 6 and 10 per cent over the next three years we would present that offer to our members for acceptance
4726958 if the government also separated the new funding model from the enterprise bargaining process then we could avoid further industrial action and disruption to teachers students and parents she said
4726959 i believe the governments intransigence is purely a fiscal decision because the longer they take to resolve it the more money they save she said
4726960 i was attracted to koha initially because its open source ive got four computers running ubuntu here
4726961 i actually installed koha myself on my desktop so i was able to get a feel for it
4726962 i briefly flirted with the idea of just doing it all myself but it became apparent pretty quickly that it was going to be a more cost effective use of my time to contract out to liblime
4726963 koha is a grand innovation for a small library it gives you all the toys that the big kids have but is manageable and affordable plus if youre a techie you can install it yourself and kick the wheels a little whats not to love
4726964 we expect to grow our consortium beyond the initial 11 libraries and anticipate that some school and possibly academic libraries may join
4726965 sekls consortium libraries liked the idea of an open source product whose future development we could help determine and which could be customized to our circumstances
4726966 koha was powerful enough to accommodate our needs and potential growth and flexible enough to do what we want at a cost we could afford
4726967 we at mlc are very pleased to be involved in the evergreen project
4726968 evergreen is rapidly gaining ground in libraries worldwide branch district library is just one of at least thirty migrations to evergreen we will see in 2008
4726969 its not like you to not put touhou on your psp

4726987 biscardi is a las vegas promoter and a showman and hes doing it again
4726988 we always say this is the end of biscardi hes never coming back i mean the man has nine lives
4726989 is to attract lots of attention to himself to hold the attention of the mass media while he arranges various deals for documentaries books etc

4727009 there are still lots of young writers artists photographers who come here for the seclusion of the dunes

4727011 i had a big wild turkey blocking my way in here the other day

4727014 there was a cement company here in the 1940s and legend has it that the office of that company is still buried out here somewhere when they open the shacks at the beginning of the season
4727015 its not unusual to have to shovel the sand out of them
4727016 they control the renting of the shacks if you want to apply you have to buy an annual membership its about 50 then if your name is selected you can take the shack for a week or two weeks
4727017 sometimes when were driving along the trails therell be a broom handle with an envelope stuck on it inside the envelope itll have a grocery list and a cheque and well take it downtown and pick up the stuff

4727254 our family toured the wine regions of napa sonoma and the mid coast of california as well as tuscany in italy and the rhine river valley in germany
4727255 we went to many inns and wineries and brought back the best ideas from each region
4727256 we wanted these buildings to look like they belong here and we think the architects have done a wonderful job of giving a current interpretation to the victorian farmhouse look
4727257 the biggest mistake people make is not communicating with their lending institution as soon as they recognize their ability to make the payments is threatened
4727258 people need to begin tracking their income and expenses closely and if needed seek help from a financial counselor to develop a workable budget or spending plan
4727259 i feel that my business demonstrates my love for god and jesus by offering reasonable prices for bibles
4727260 providing bibles is a way to let people know my true character if i have a customer who needs something that i do not have listed i will try my best to locate it for him or her
4727261 i want to add more products to my site such as more audio study and reference material and religious jewels
4727262 i will use the blog to create a desire for folks to want to have a bible i will cover several topics such as scripture and archaeological evidence of gods plan for salvation
4727263 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con i have ever seen in my professional career
4727264 last year saw the tragic death of our trainee fieldmaster and her family have since raised money for the air ambulance and we wanted to do our bit
4727265 and although jo anne is no longer with us her family is fully supporting the event
4727266 the event is sponsored by many local companies and there will be a choice of distances to cover from four to fifteen miles
4727267 there will also be a prize for the most sponsorship money raised
4727268 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio
4727269 he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall sic need to pull that back and they would oblige its incredible that now i get the opportunity to i dont know maybe pay r kelly back in some sort of side bar kind of thing
4727270 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations
4727271 there are few south bay locations better than our current one but im convinced our new offices will be even more advantageous for our employees customers and overall presence in the community
4727272 this is a really huge thing for us because were moving into a real prime area of torrance
4727273 from an editorial from an advertising from a community standpoint were positioned to be in the heart of torrance
4727274 its been a long search through a lot of different buildings in the torrance area
4727275 its the most recent class a building built in torrance
4727276 our unemployment rate will grow far worse and more californians will lose their jobs if we pass a budget that increases taxes
4727277 the worst thing you can do for the economy is make cuts especially to health care
4727278 i think its very clear that health care cuts specifically would have three times as great an economic impact as an increase of taxes on the upper income
4727279 while 7 3 percent of california workers and their families are struggling with unemployment all residents are facing higher energy and food prices and sharply lower home prices
4727280 it is abundantly clear that the states economy is sagging in a dramatic way with little sign of stabilization
4727281 what we really have is pretty much a housing recession and a slowdown in the rest of the economy
4727282 that results in a lot of volatility in our unemployment rate but theres no doubt that its trending up
4727283 the labour market has developed in such a positive way in the past two years that we will not attain the old record levels of more than five million jobless
4727284 the number of unemployed could go down by 40 000 to an annual average of 3 234 million
4727285 cuando empec en esto cobraba unos sesenta euros por un completo ahora cobro entre treinta y cuarenta
4727286 llevo nueve meses intentando trabajar en esto aunque ahora la cosa est muy dif cil a ver si mejora en septiembre
4727287 ltimamente todas las chicas se quejan del descenso de clientes especialmente desde la huelga de camioneros de junio
4727288 adem s si puede se queda con mis clientes porque est claro que la gente de fuera nos quita el trabajo a las espa olas
4727289 aunque tal y como est n las cosas la verdad es que la entiendo
4727290 la gente que trabaja en esto ya ni se toma una semana de vacaciones
4727291 la crisis se siente much simo y este trabajo no tiene promedio de facturaci n fija es como el mercado burs til
4727292 es natural cuando hay menos dinero para gastar se gasta menos
4727293 la crisis empez a notarse pr cticamente despu s de las elecciones hay muchos menos clientes y sin embargo m s se oritas que piden plaza en nuestros hoteles
4727294 el verano lo trastoca todo la gente pasa las vacaciones en la playa y muchas veces las se oritas se desplazan tambi n desde el interior de espa a detr s del cliente

4727299 sacarle todo el partido emocional posible a ese ejercicio de soledad e individualismo absoluto
4727300 eso de la generaci n es un paraguas que abriga a quienes tienen que hacer algo para no sentirse solos es algo muy antiguo
4727301 qu nos une se pregunta y responde pues que vemos el mismo sol cuando nos levantamos el mismo cielo comemos m s o menos lo mismo s lo eso
4727302 no lo m s c modo es el libro ahora en esta poca en una piscina en la playa y en el sof en la cama alguien se lleva a esos sitios un ordenador para leer
4727303 no es s lo letras es algo muy personal es tener un privilegio del que no somos muy conscientes porque lo es poder acercarte a los m s brillantes que tienen con nosotros los lectores la cortes a de darnos a conocer su pensamiento
4727304 cada uno hace cosas diferentes lo que ocurre es que siempre pues es algo muy antiguo ha habido la necesidad de encontrar una excusa para justificar una novedad que en realidad no lo es
4727305 eso de la generaci n son ganas de categorizar quiz as funcione
4727306 ni tertulias generacionales tal vez intergeneracional s con gente de otra edad
4727307 alguien mencion nocilla dream me habl de su estilo fragmentario pero es mera coincidencia no tiene nada que ver
4727308 lo que podr a denominarse operaci n fracaso en contraposici n a operaci n triunfo
4727309 porque cada uno est en algo personal distinto a lo que hace el resto coexisten puntos de vista radicalmente opuestos y no existe una homogeneidad tem tica
4727310 entusiasmen y atrapen al lector que haya en ellas fascinaci n magia
4727311 generaci n no hay nada de eso aqu tal vez en otras zonas como catalu a donde les va m s eso del merchandising es algo artificial una cuesti n publicitaria period stica
4727312 vergonzante y provoca sonrojo que a estas alturas se considere algo vanguardista e incluso maldito algo tan antiguo a m personalmente me da risa
4727313 lo m s interesante que puede apreciarse es la diversidad que hay entre nosotros con intereses narrativos distintos y una independencia y libertad absoluta
4727314 estudiosos que han le do mucho pero de un talento menor
4727315 siempre han sido los autores de una val a inferior los que m s esfuerzo han hecho por hablar de una generaci n en la que por supuesto figurar an ellos cela no necesit ninguna ni garc a m rquez ni vargas llosa
4727316 una clara operaci n de marketing destinada a encumbrar a

4727318 sean ninguna novedad ni elementos decisivos aunque algunos los quieran convertir en se as de identidad literarias no soy tecn fobo ni tengo ning n sentido elitista de la cultura nada de eso simplemente en mi formaci n como autor han tenido m s peso otros elementos

4727330 kinderen hebben recht op ruimte om te spelen tijdens de vakantie naar aanleiding van een aantal berichten in de media tv n journaal en nieuws tvoost vrijdag 18 juli de standaard en het nieuwsblad vrijdag 18 juli en de morgen zaterdag 19 juli in verband met het tijdelijk sluiten van de speelpleinwerking in een aantal gemeenten waaronder ook wetteren vragen de gemeenteraadsleden van de partij groen amp co dat er dringend overleg wordt gepleegd tussen de verantwoordelijken van het gemeentebestuur om te zoeken naar een gepaste oplossing voor een permanente en duurzame creatieve verderzetting van enerzijds de opvangmogelijkheden voor kinderen tijdens de vakantie als anderzijds een ontspannende verantwoorde en avontuurlijke mogelijkheid voor kinderen om de vakantie speels te beleven op dit moment is het zo dat kinderen van de lagereschoolleeftijd de komende twee tot drie weken op geen enkele manier een beroep kunnen doen noch op de diensten van de ibos buitenschoolse kinderopvang wegens jaarlijks driewekelijks verlof noch op de diensten van de wetterse speelpleinwerking wesp wegens een nijpend tekort aan monitoren waardoor aan de noodzakelijke minimale begeleidingsmodaliteiten niet kan voldaan worden groen amp co is er van overtuigd dat de verantwoordelijken van het speelplein wesp alles in het werk stellen om meer dan honderd kinderen dagelijks een creatieve ontspannende en avontuurlijke vakantie aan te bieden maar dat zijzelf ook stuiten op een groeiend fenomeen dat jongeren in hun vakantie meer en meer uitkijken naar meer lucratieve en beterbetaalde vakantiejobs in plaats van een paar weken als monitor op een speelplein te werken een vakantiejob die nochtans in wetteren ook goed vergoed wordt maar los van de oorzaken om gedurende de vakantie een noodzakelijk minimum minimorum aan ge ngageerde en enthousiaste monitoren of stagiairs te bereiken moet het gemeentebestuur zich ook de vraag durven stellen of het kan dat er gedurende een aantal weken geen enkele mogelijkheid geboden wordt tot opvang van kinderen er zijn immers gezinnen waar de ouder s in de onmogelijkheid is zijn om hun kinderen ergens anders dan in de offici le diensten te laten opvangen een gemeente waar steeds meer jonge gezinnen komen wonen net omwille van de aangeboden verschillende faciliteiten kan het zich niet veroorloven om tijdens de vakantie de deuren voor opvang te sluiten al dan niet gedwongen door omstandigheden buiten hun wil vandaar dat groen amp co vraagt dat er dringend een overleg wordt gestart om te zoeken naar alternatieven misschien dat het voor deze vakantie niet echt meer mogelijk is degelijke en aanvaardbare oplossingen te vinden dan moet zeker de situatie bekeken en besproken worden in functie van de volgende vakantieperioden de komende maanden en jaren want deze evolutie waar het moeilijk is voldoende monitoren te vinden gedurende bepaalde periodes zal niet van vandaag op morgen stoppen zowel de schepen van jeugd als de schepen van sociale zaken moeten hier hun verantwoordelijkheid opnemen en samen met de verantwoordelijke diensten dringend rond de tafel gaan zitten de zomervakantie moet voor alle kinderen een feest zijn
4727331 kann mir jemand sagen was mit diesem bild nicht stimmt

4727336 we have seen a trend in several of our top hotel markets of more guests at hotels being locals or from nearby areas
4727337 houston for example has seen some of the most significant increases in this category
4727338 we do know the word on the street is that its happening
4727339 people join for getting towed but stay for the extra benefits
4727340 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
4727341 at that time a lot of people may have decided to stay in the area because of fuel prices
4727342 the no 1 reason people visit the houston area is to see friends and family
4727343 weve seen an increase this summer in just our regional destination draw
4727344 but we figured we werent not going to go on vacation so we went to the woodlands
4727345 we went to florida only because we had a 60 resort stay for the week

4727360 the race will be timed to follow on from the melbourne cup and will form the centrepiece of an international festival celebrating the best that western australian racing and pacing has to offer
4727361 so far all we are getting from the opposition are vague ideas and half baked concepts
4727362 when we realised that we couldnt go forward and we had to set up the tent quickly i guess it was then that we knew we could be stuck there
4727363 i was just going to cry it was just this massive relief that came over me
4727364 i suppose you would say its mixed emotions through the group
4727365 some of them are extremely relieved to be down here and others are sort of annoyed that we required rescuing
4727366 i believe they could have had better gear like avalanche beacons and shovels
4727367 these guys were really lucky they didnt suffer any cold weather injuries or anything like that

4727380 ik heb het volste vertrouwen in mijn coach lieve van mechelen red zij zorgt er altijd voor dat ik op het juiste moment klaar ben en inderdaad iedere keer bam het komt eruit ik ben 110 maar waar dat me brengt is moeilijk te voorspellen het is een sprintnummer v r het wk in osaka had ik de 32ste tijd en ik werd 13de ik probeer gewoon opnieuw top 16 maar zal daarvoor harder uit mijn pijp moeten komen dan in osaka want iedereen is nog scherper dan vorig jaar het slechtste scenario voor mij is dat ik er in de kwartfinales uitga
4727381 qua tijd is mijn doel 20 30 maar om dat te lopen moet alles goed zitten in de reeksen zal dat waarschijnlijk niet lukken want ik ben niet echt een ochtendmens aan het record van stevens denk ik niet dat is nog te ver voor mij
4727382 voor een gebrek aan frisheid op de 4x400 m moet ik echter niet bang zijn zelfs als ik de finale loop op de 200 m zit er nog een dag tussen ik heb alle trainingen meegedaan met het team maar we hebben het voor mij wel wat aangepast in yantai hebben zij nog op weerstand getraind maar we hebben een gulden middenweg gevonden zo kon ik mijn dingen doen maar toch meetrainen met hen wat belangrijk was voor de groepssfeer
4727383 ik zal nooit onder druk van een timing toelaten dat we evolueren naar open grenzen

4727407 in this study we found that the household media environment was related to a childs academic achievement
4727408 among these third graders we saw that even when controlling for the parents education level the childs gender and the amount of media used per week those who had bedroom tv sets scored around 8 points lower on math and language arts tests and 7 points lower on reading tests a home computer showed the opposite relationship children with access to a home computer had scores that were around 6 points higher on the math and the language arts test and 4 points higher on the reading test controlling for the same variables
4727409 educators and parents are looking for ways to improve childrens standardized test scores this study suggests that something as logical and straightforward as taking tv sets out of kids bedrooms or not putting them there in the first place may be a solution
4727410 while this study does not prove that bedroom tv sets caused the lower test scores it adds to accumulating data that kids shouldnt have tvs in their bedrooms it also suggests that investing in a home computer for a child to use may be an additional strategy to help your childs test scores the best combination was having both no tv in the bedroom and also a home computer to use
4727411 extensive viewing of violent television shows and video games can lead to an emotional desensitization children may seek increasing horrific programming just to feel some emotional response
4727412 the neural pathways that control how we respond to stress seem to be particularly powerful in shaping how we learn and behave and our overall health
4727413 when a child is under prolonged stress the childs brain sends a signal for his body to produce greater amounts of a stress hormone called cortisol the constant release of cortisol means the child is constantly on high alert
4727414 there is a sensitive period that begins before age eight when children are especially susceptible to the effects of violence shown on tv
4727415 neurological processing of entertainment violence is not different from processing real violence
4727416 young children do not process information in the same way as adults
4727417 nor do they have the experience to evaluate what they see
4727418 as multi level sensory deprivation that may be stunting the growth of our childrens brains
4727419 children observe novel aggressive behaviours and learn vicariously that aggressive acts are rewarded
4727420 they store these new behaviours in memory as part of the repitoire of actions that are available to get them what they want
4727421 that young children do not possess an instinct for gauging whether a behaviour ought to be imitated
4727422 they will imitate anything including behaviors that most adults would regard as destructive and antisocial
4727423 there is increasing concern that the lack of proper stimulation may be damaging brains the same may be true of too much exposure to the wrong kind of stimulation such as violence
4727424 as the images assault the brain the noradrenaline level rises keeping the body in a constant state of readiness easy to startle quick to blow up
4727425 play is clearly a vehicle for many of the childs most important learnings and the means whereby he is able to practice and develop behaviours necessary to his success as a social being
4727426 not only does tv viewing lead to a reduction in play time there is evidence to suggest that it has affected the nature of childrens play particularly indoor play
4727427 when programs are chosen carefully when tv time is limited and when parents watch too actively then the boob tube can indeed enrich our childrens lives
4727428 so that it provides opportunities for children to share their views gain knowledge go beyond tv visions develop critical viewing skills make critical choices build on resources work together with parents and have the freedom to play
4727429 we all know that the brains of newborns continue to develop rapidly that the final tuning is done as it were outside the womb the rapid pace of tv may not help
4727430 the idea came to me when i was at home with my three month old son if he saw a television he was mesmerised by it he had no idea of what the content was i was curious what the effect of that degree of stimulation would be
4727431 in contrast to the pace with which real life unfolds and is experienced by young children television can portray rapidly changing images scenery and events
4727432 it can be overstimulating and yet extremely interesting this has led some to theorise that television may shorten childrens attention spans
4727433 what is a one year old doing when it watches television and how does this compare to how other ages watch television
4727434 these sorts of questions get lost and yet they are fundamental to any decent research
4727435 yeah right all those make your baby smarter videos are doing is creating a docile drug addict in front of the screen i have encouraged my children to climb and be physical surely thats better than letting them sit in front of the telly
4727436 we have found doctors very reluctant to say there is a link between tv viewing and attention deficit
4727437 doctors are keen to say its genetic or behavioural you should talk to teachers who are at the brunt of it they will say that your mind works differently if you watch tv when youre very young
4727438 children in particular are implicitly seen to be passive and defenceless in the face of media manipulation television because of its inherently visual nature one wonders what happened to the soundtrack is effectively seen to bypass cognition entirely it requires no intellectual emotional or imaginative investment but simply imprints itself on the childs consciousness again no empirical basis is offered for these assertions
4727439 too much television can negatively affect early brain development this is especially true at younger ages when learning to talk and play with others is so important until more research is done about the effects of tv on very young children the american academy of paediatrics does not recommend television for children age two or younger
4727440 ten years ago this label didnt exist what used to be called bloody annoying children has had a label put on it and this has consequences drug companies are making big money out of making tranquillisers like ritalin for children and there are whole industries in medical research working to construct this way of defining childrens behaviour
4727441 when one thinks of how tv viewing is associated with violence among children this is used by politicians as a way of displacing attention away from other causes of violence in society that are difficult to eradicate such as racism poverty gun control im by no means saying that there arent associations just that it is too easy to blame one thing for childrens problems were dealing with really complicated matters here that readily get over simplified
4727442 help her to understand fantasy and reality the difference between a sales pitch and an honest evaluation
4727443 educational television can have a very positive impact on young children
4727444 children who watched educational programming particularly at age 2 and 3 performed better on tests of school related skills than children who did not watch educational television
4727445 watching a lot of general audience programming was related to poor skills
4727446 when the television programs are designed to teach children learn good things if they are not designed to teach and especially if they include violence children learn things that end up being bad for their behavior
4727447 these children very often dont have other educational resources available in their homes such as age appropriate books and parents often dont understand the importance of reading to their children and encouraging their children to read
4727448 television is a powerful tool to teach things good or bad
4727449 watching too much television takes away time children spend on exercise and other school related activities
4727450 more than 2 hours of viewing time may have health consequences for children such as obesity
4727451 providing general guidance on whether infants should be watching television and how much time children should spend in front of the screen is hardly radical screen medica must now be considered a major public health issue and reducing television viewing must become the new priority for child health
4727452 there are plenty of studies that indicate the educational value of programmes for children and the socialisation value in the way that they create conversations rather than destimulate them
4727453 little room for doubt concerning the negative nature of the overall linear relationship between television viewing and educational achievement
4727454 the finding of a larger optimal viewing time for younger children may be related to their higher quality viewing
4727455 educational television has a substantial positive impact and that entertainment television has a negative impact
4727456 the impact of television on cognitive development and educational achievement
4727457 relations of television viewing and reading findings from a 4 year longitudinal study
4727458 associations between media viewing and language development in children under age 2 years
4727459 the remote the mouse and the no 2 pencil the household media environment and academic achievement among third grade students
4727460 association between television movie and video game exposure and school performance
4727461 lack of association between video game exposure and school performance
4727462 extensive television viewing and the development of attention and learning difficulties during adolescence
4727463 little support for the hypothesis that a small amount of television is beneficial
4727464 association of television viewing during childhood with poor educational achievement
4727465 this study shows that terrific television causes kids to be more receptive to learning more receptive to reading more receptive in school
4727466 most other studies have looked at television generally in its effect on kids and their intellectual development but not at specific different types of television
4727467 the children we need to worry about most in this country are the kind of children who were examined in this study
4727468 its very unlikely youd find the results for kids in one part of the country differ much from another part of the country
4727469 most neuroscientists today argue that the biological organ inside our skulls is both source and repository of our elusive identity and of all aspects of cognition and emotion
4727470 the brain is the master control of our health and well being competencies and coping skills it directs all aspects of bodily functions through established biological pathways
4727471 children who admire aggressiveness in their heroes and heroines may see little reason for devoting time and effort to learning other ways of problem solving
4727472 extensive viewing of violent television shows and video games can lead to an emotional desensitization children may seek increasing horrific programming just to feel some emotional response
4727473 the neural pathways that control how we respond to stress seem to be particularly powerful in shaping how we learn and behave and our overall health
4727474 when a child is under prolonged stress the childs brain sends a signal for his body to produce greater amounts of a stress hormone called cortisol the constant release of cortisol means the child is constantly on high alert
4727475 there is a sensitive period that begins before age eight when children are especially susceptible to the effects of violence shown on tv
4727476 neurological processing of entertainment violence is not different from processing real violence
4727477 young children do not process information in the same way as adults
4727478 nor do they have the experience to evaluate what they see
4727479 as multi level sensory deprivation that may be stunting the growth of our childrens brains
4727480 children observe novel aggressive behaviours and learn vicariously that aggressive acts are rewarded
4727481 they store these new behaviours in memory as part of the repitoire of actions that are available to get them what they want
4727482 that young children do not possess an instinct for gauging whether a behaviour ought to be imitated
4727483 they will imitate anything including behaviors that most adults would regard as destructive and antisocial
4727484 there is increasing concern that the lack of proper stimulation may be damaging brains the same may be true of too much exposure to the wrong kind of stimulation such as violence
4727485 as the images assault the brain the noradrenaline level rises keeping the body in a constant state of readiness easy to startle quick to blow up
4727486 play is clearly a vehicle for many of the childs most important learnings and the means whereby he is able to practice and develop behaviours necessary to his success as a social being
4727487 not only does tv viewing lead to a reduction in play time there is evidence to suggest that it has affected the nature of childrens play particularly indoor play
4727488 when programs are chosen carefully when tv time is limited and when parents watch too actively then the boob tube can indeed enrich our childrens lives
4727489 so that it provides opportunities for children to share their views gain knowledge go beyond tv visions develop critical viewing skills make critical choices build on resources work together with parents and have the freedom to play
4727490 educational television can have a very positive impact on young children
4727491 children who watched educational programming particularly at age 2 and 3 performed better on tests of school related skills than children who did not watch educational television
4727492 watching a lot of general audience programming was related to poor skills
4727493 when the television programs are designed to teach children learn good things if they are not designed to teach and especially if they include violence children learn things that end up being bad for their behavior
4727494 these children very often dont have other educational resources available in their homes such as age appropriate books and parents often dont understand the importance of reading to their children and encouraging their children to read
4727495 television is a powerful tool to teach things good or bad
4727496 watching too much television takes away time children spend on exercise and other school related activities
4727497 more than 2 hours of viewing time may have health consequences for children such as obesity
4727498 we all know that the brains of newborns continue to develop rapidly that the final tuning is done as it were outside the womb the rapid pace of tv may not help
4727499 the idea came to me when i was at home with my three month old son if he saw a television he was mesmerised by it he had no idea of what the content was i was curious what the effect of that degree of stimulation would be
4727500 in contrast to the pace with which real life unfolds and is experienced by young children television can portray rapidly changing images scenery and events
4727501 it can be overstimulating and yet extremely interesting this has led some to theorise that television may shorten childrens attention spans
4727502 what is a one year old doing when it watches television and how does this compare to how other ages watch television
4727503 these sorts of questions get lost and yet they are fundamental to any decent research
4727504 yeah right all those make your baby smarter videos are doing is creating a docile drug addict in front of the screen i have encouraged my children to climb and be physical surely thats better than letting them sit in front of the telly
4727505 we have found doctors very reluctant to say there is a link between tv viewing and attention deficit
4727506 doctors are keen to say its genetic or behavioural you should talk to teachers who are at the brunt of it they will say that your mind works differently if you watch tv when youre very young
4727507 children in particular are implicitly seen to be passive and defenceless in the face of media manipulation television because of its inherently visual nature one wonders what happened to the soundtrack is effectively seen to bypass cognition entirely it requires no intellectual emotional or imaginative investment but simply imprints itself on the childs consciousness again no empirical basis is offered for these assertions
4727508 too much television can negatively affect early brain development this is especially true at younger ages when learning to talk and play with others is so important until more research is done about the effects of tv on very young children the american academy of paediatrics does not recommend television for children age two or younger
4727509 ten years ago this label didnt exist what used to be called bloody annoying children has had a label put on it and this has consequences drug companies are making big money out of making tranquillisers like ritalin for children and there are whole industries in medical research working to construct this way of defining childrens behaviour
4727510 when one thinks of how tv viewing is associated with violence among children this is used by politicians as a way of displacing attention away from other causes of violence in society that are difficult to eradicate such as racism poverty gun control im by no means saying that there arent associations just that it is too easy to blame one thing for childrens problems were dealing with really complicated matters here that readily get over simplified
4727511 help her to understand fantasy and reality the difference between a sales pitch and an honest evaluation
4727512 is so hugely powerful because compared to the pace with which real life unfolds and is experienced by young children it portrays life with the fast forward button fully pressed
4727513 once you are used to food with monosodium glutamate flavour enhancer real food doesnt taste as interesting television is the flavour enhancer of the audiovisual world providing unnatural levels of sensory stimulation nothing in real life is comparable to this television overpays the child to pay attention to it and in so doing it seems to physically spoil and damage his attention circuits
4727514 we wanted to know if television really is to blame for the difficulties in communication that many young children seem to have when they arrive in school what we found is that there are many social and cultural factors that have an impact but that in the right circumstances television may be useful for young childrens language development tv has been part of our popular culture for over 50 years and continues to be so
4727515 by itself its neither the cause nor the answer to language issues whats important is that parents and carers are aware of the pros and cons of tv watching and maximise the opportunities whilst diminishing potential risks
4727516 this highly experienced group of people make great tv for toddlers by spending their working lives trying to see through their eyes
4727517 programme commissioners rely on a network of nurseries pre schools and carers around the country to research their ideas they have loads of advisers literacy guidelines and early learning standards to call on and the bottom line is this highly experienced group of people make great tv for toddlers by spending their working lives trying to see through their eyes
4727518 everybody realises there is a huge learning period for children from zero to 18 months but nobody is making anything for them those kids are like sponges at that age and theres a great opportunity there that might scare people but it is a very interesting area
4727519 babies to build and develop their powers of logic reasoning and observation
4727520 babies of this age are interested in their own impact on the world and in their parents reaction to them they are not interested in looking at things far away they will learn more by looking at their own hands and feet or seeing whether they can touch their nose
4727521 by far the most important things for mothers are to bond and talk and play with their babies but if we are going to be bombarded with videos for babies i thought it was better to have something intelligent on the market

4727584 ansf afghan national security forces and coalition forces returned fire with small arms and close air support multiple vehicles and enemy fighting positions were destroyed
4727585 coalition forces responded with air strikes and small arms fire killing the militants
4727586 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4727587 mak ing such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4727588 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4727589 both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4727590 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4727591 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4727592 what does the whole security labeling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4727593 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4727594 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4727595 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4727596 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4727597 even then i will forward it to technical people on an as needed basis because even that embargo secrecy is not some insane absolute thing

4727670 we are the jailingest motherf ckers on the planet more than that the number of violent offenders in federal prisons has gone down to its lowest level ever in the history of the country in the single digits by the bureau of prisons own statistics and the political party that let this get out of control it was the democrats the drug war has actually destroyed the deterrent in inner cities by teaching whole police departments to chase drug stats when they should be solving crimes and of course because they cant put all those people in prison it doesnt even work as a draconian policy most people are just thrown back onto the street a smart politician could cite all these things and we could stop the madness but everyones worried that the little old lady in terre haute is going to think youre soft on drugs i think all the little old ladies in terre haute get it the american people are smarter than politicians give them credit for if mccain came to a democratic congress with reforms i think hed be a hero to moderates everywhere because do you know people who believe in the drug war i dont know if theres a cop in baltimore who believes in it except as a means of getting overtime pay i think everybody knows except the government
4727671 he visto la carrera unos minutos despu s y o do algunas cosas sobre un protesta pero no pienso sobre eso es grande ganar una medalla yo no puedo despegar yo s que tengo una llegada larga y phelps una corta
4727672 llegue pensando en el bronce y he hecho una mejor y he conseguido la de plata esto es lo que los resultados muestran en la pantalla
4727673 ganar por una cent sima es dif cil es la derrota m s dura pero es un milagro que yo est aqu considerando que hace un a o y medio me iba a retirar estoy disfrutando de coraz n y desear a haber ganado una medalla de oro pero estoy feliz con la plata
4727674 esperaba que fuera a por el r cord del mundo pero es un honor nadar con michael phelps fue grande que todos los ojos estuvieran en m mirando al chico que pod a batir a michael phelps es una pena que no acab ramos los dos en 50 58 me hubiera gustado compartir el oro
4727675 creo que si lo hacemos otra vez yo ganar el oro
4727676 it was an amazing experience just sitting on the start line with the romanians and the belarus team
4727677 i have joined a great club and it is a chance for me to win cups and medals it is a great opportunity and i am very excited about this move
4727678 i know that rangers and celtic are the biggest clubs in the country and every year these clubs try to become champions
4727679 i have seen a lot of highlights of scottish football and of course the derby against celtic this is a very big game and it is a match when you are sitting at home you dream about playing in
4727680 there was a telephone call a couple of weeks ago
4727681 i was shopping with my wife when the recent call came and i had to go home and pack our stuff to come to scotland my wife was sad but i hear there are nice shops in glasgow too
4727682 rangers are such a big club one that should play in the champions league every year and big clubs like that always attract
4727683 of course i would love to be involved in uefa competitions thats a reason to move forward and try to be champions this year
4727684 it was a good performance and possessed the ball more than them my goal in this tournament was to give an opportunity to the young players and i congratulate them on their attitude

4727688 he conseguido tambi n encontrar documentaci n en la que jos stalin y otros generales sovi ticos
4727689 oficialmente solicito a las autoridades rusas autorizar un an lisis gen tico de la mand bula para comprobar que tengo raz n
4727690 el an lisis de adn de los restos de hitler en poder del fsb deben compararse con los restos de su hermana menor paula fallecida en 1960 y sepultada en el cementerio de bergfriedhof en berchetesgaden baviera alemania
4727691 los restos que conserva el fsb pueden ser falsos porque su autenticidad se bas en comparaciones con radiograf as de la dentadura de hitler de muy mala calidad y los testimonios de su dentista personal
4727692 la teor a sobre la fuga de hitler de berl n expuesta por basti en general coincide con el libro el escape de hitler del escritor patrick burnside seg n burnside hitler se evadi de berl n en un avi n hasta noruega y desde ese pa s en de submarinos sic viaj hasta argentina donde vivi inc gnito al menos 15 a os en su libro el autor cit cuatro testigos que afirmaron que se toparon con hitler entre los a os 1945 y 1957
4727693 no no no su nombre verdadero su nombre de la ss
4727694 in the early games you need to take points and i think thats what is going to make the difference because i think it is going to be a very tight season this year
4727695 last season we played decent football in the first three games but we drew them so you are already behind the eight ball in this period here you really need to hit the ground running
4727696 reidy is a superb passer of the ball hes very experienced always looks forward and hes another one who hasnt had much game time but hes a very good professional and does everything asked of him and more
4727697 we created chances through the pre season cup but we were a little bit rusty in front of goal so hopefully we can put a couple away on the weekend
4727698 its always a special day the opening round of the season and playing at home we will obviously be looking for the three points so we cant wait to get out there
4727699 i think everybody could see it was a bad performance but a very good result if we had conceded one or two goals it would have been more difficult we will now play the second leg at anfield in front of our supporters
4727700 the players know we didnt play well but they know for the second game how important it is to get behind the team because we want to be in the champions league
4727701 the reaction of the players in the dressing room after the game was very positive and the team will be ready
4727702 clearly it is too soon to judge them we are talking about players with quality and game intelligence and they will need time in a new team with different players you need time and in this case nobody can say anything about the quality that they both have
4727703 yes but you cannot change the fixtures so we know we have to play them away from home in the first game last season was a good game for us when we won 2 0 at sunderland so hopefully it will be the same this time
4727704 you never know because the other teams had good squads before we want to be closer we have confidence and i think my squad is better than last season the average age of the squad is good so i think the team can be a very good one now and also in the future
4727705 when we signed martin skrtel it made a massive difference for us because we had three centre backs available and now we have four
4727706 for our fans they want us to win the premier league the champions league the fa cup and carling cup if you say to me what do i want my idea is always to win trophies every year we know how difficult it is we have to win the first game and then after that think about the next one
4727707 i think the fans put the premier league as number one because we won the champions league in 2005 we want to win the premier league
4727708 the accident took place late friday night on the outskirts of etah as the driver of the private bus lost control over the vehicle
4727709 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria

4727732 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4727733 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4727734 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4727735 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4727736 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4727737 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4727738 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4727739 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4727740 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4727741 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4727742 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4727743 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4727744 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4727745 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4727746 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4727747 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4727748 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4727749 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4727750 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4727751 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to

4727804 the bottom line is everyone looks at how ireland did at the world cup last year
4727805 we think were certainly at that stage now where if we get a big performance with two or three guys holding their hands up we can put ourselves in a position to get a big win

4727814 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people

4727816 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4727817 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4727818 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4727821 some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in pakistan when muslims the world over fast in the holy month of ramazan
4727822 the truth is that even within the pcb there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days
4727823 if the icc manages to convince the teams that champions trophy should be held in pakistan then it would be a major achievement but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage travelling to pakistan
4727824 i dont understand this given the critical situation when the icc task force was in pakistan the chairman was not in the country then why send coach geoff lawson to australia and new zealand when already in the past even the australians were not convinced by his arguments about playing in pakistan
4727825 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4727826 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4727827 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4727828 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4727829 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4727830 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4727831 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies

4727873 i have to be honest we had a few touch and go moments
4727874 ive had sciatica pain down my leg for the week
4727875 i just said i didnt want to know what the options were and all that sort of stuff
4727876 i didnt care i wasnt going to go through the thing like 2000 again it wasnt an option
4727877 at the start of the week there were a few hairy moments where we didnt know where it was going to go
4727878 so we havent really rowed apart from the races we were just about having the best row of our lives
4727879 from a week ago and whats happened in the week weve had a lot of highs and lows in emotions and thoughts
4727880 drew obviously didnt want to talk about it too much in terms of how bad it was and i didnt want to ask him about it
4727881 i wanted him to row and it wasnt really an option planning to row with anyone else
4727882 for him to do what hes done with the injury hes had has been awesome
4727883 to get through the week in the minimal amount of work that weve done has been great
4727884 kita sudah lama hendak jumpa mereka tetapi sehingga hari ini belum dipanggil lagi

4727888 apakah prinsip dan garis sempadan dan apakah misi besar yang ada dalam pakatan
4727889 bagaimana bentuk mesyuarat dan keputusan yang telah dibuat mengapa pakatan diwujudkan

4727895 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
4727896 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4727897 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
4727898 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4727899 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist

4727940 adem s si puede se queda con mis clientes porque est claro que la gente de fuera nos quita el trabajo a las espa olas
4727941 aunque tal y como est n las cosas la verdad es que la entiendo
4727942 la gente que trabaja en esto ya ni se toma una semana de vacaciones
4727943 la crisis se siente much simo y este trabajo no tiene promedio de facturaci n fija es como el mercado burs til

4727949 who gives a hit the bong and chill the out listen to the final countdown for crying out loud
4727950 i would definitely push for it this has been my proposal since the last congress when we attempted to introduce charter changes
4727951 well then the president vice president and members of congress should all have a term of five years
4727952 in that case they will all be elected at the same time and elections will be held only every five years instead of every three years it will be less expensive for taxpayers
4727953 we will really block all efforts to convene a constituent assembly even if it would reach the supreme court which really is the only way should the lower house vote for it
4727954 con ass is very dangerous before we know it it would already be pushing for the extension of the term of the president because it can already have its own agenda and discuss anything it chooses
4727955 secretary dureza is all wrong in using resolution no 10 for cha cha because it is just a proposed resolution and it is not final yet
4727956 all the senators who signed resolution no 10 expressed their reservations especially as to the timing and who is pushing for federalism
4727957 we signed it supporting the move for federalism of senate minority leader pimentel but we signed it for purposes of discussions only
4727958 in the end i dont believe malaca angs move is to empower our muslim brothers
4727959 the constituent assembly because it has the power to amend the constitution can even abolish congress and is therefore not subservient to it
4727960 secondly there will be a powerful bicameral committee that will decide on the said resolution and insert provisions that will allow president arroyo to run in the 2010 election
4727961 the overwhelming number of president arroyos allies in the house will ensure that such an insertion will be approved in the same manner that bicameral committees in the past have inserted alien provisions in bills approved by both houses of congress
4727962 it is foolhardy therefore even for opposition members to support moves to amend the charter now the minority will never have the numbers to resist the juggernaut that president arroyo will unleash just to stay in power beyond 2010
4727963 charter change that will perpetuate president arroyos power and eliminate the protectionist economic policies in the constitution could result in a violent upheaval in the country
4727964 the house committee on constitutional amendments and congress should instead of rushing the process conduct consultations with the people especially in the light of the known and admitted resistance of the people to charter change
4727965 to ram charter change down the throats of the people is to invite violent reactions that will only further exacerbate the political and economic crisis plaguing the country today
4727966 this is unconstitutional because all natural resources belong to the state and bje is not a state
4727967 you have to look at dynamics how it moves forward it will be a little complicated in due time when things settle down at this point in time its hard to discuss this because nothing has been signed yet
4727968 search for peace is constant so resolve is always there the alternative to a situation of not getting peace settlement is unimaginable
4727969 the alternative is war from the beginning of her term she is hoping and working for building blocks of peace for mindanao not just for muslims but for lumads and christians and for the whole country
4727970 if a path is closed we will go to another
4727971 lets wait for the final word of the senate and there might be something in the decision of the sc that will guide us on how to proceed with legal processes to give life to the intent of the moa
4727972 i think it behooves the government the peace panel and everybody concerned to have a backup plan if we are really determined to pursue the peace plan
4727973 im not just talking about charter change we wont die without charter change we will not stop you know no setback is big enough to stop us from pursuing this
4727974 we have learned over the past several weeks how unaware the affected local governments and their people were to what the government peace panel was doing behind their backs
4727975 by creating a separate bangsamoro juridical entity within the country the government would have only succeeded in increasing hostilities in the south under the guise of a peace agreement
4727976 only peace negotiations and aggressive efforts at effective governance with concrete results will bring about lasting peace and prosperity
4727977 the credibility of the peace pact is now highly suspect with malaca ang pressing for cha cha along with it and the flawed exclusive process undertaken to have the agreement
4727978 it is imperative for them to take a stand and sympathize with those opposing the inclusion of mindanao communities in the planned bangsamoro juridical entity
4727979 our local leaders and the people in the so called villages covered by the bje were not consulted before the document was laid down for finalization by both panels

4728355 most scientific and policy discussions about avoiding climate change have centered on what emissions would be needed to stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
4728356 but stabilizing greenhouse gases does not equate to a stable climate we studied what emissions would be needed to stabilize climate in the foreseeable future
4728357 what if we were to discover tomorrow that a climate catastrophe was imminent if our planet warmed any further to reduce emissions enough to avoid this catastrophe we would have to cut them close to zero and right away
4728358 it is just not that hard to solve the technological challenges
4728359 we can develop and deploy wind turbines electric cars and so on and live well without damaging the environment the future can be better than the present but we have to take steps to start kicking the co2 habit now so we wont need to go cold turkey later

4728398 stillish archie what are number one move in this vicinity
4728399 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4728400 this is a planning took where all things are going
4728401 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4728402 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4728403 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4728404 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4728405 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4728406 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4728407 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4728408 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4728409 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4728410 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4728411 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4728412 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4728413 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4728414 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4728415 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4728416 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4728417 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4728418 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4728419 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4728420 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4728421 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4728422 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4728423 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4728424 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4728425 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4728426 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4728427 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4728428 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4728429 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4728430 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4728431 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4728432 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4728433 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4728434 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4728435 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4728436 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4728437 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4728438 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4728439 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4728440 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4728441 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4728442 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4728443 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4728444 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4728445 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4728446 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4728447 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4728448 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4728449 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4728450 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4728451 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4728452 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4728453 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4728454 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4728455 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4728456 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4728457 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4728458 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4728459 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4728460 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4728461 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4728462 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4728463 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4728464 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4728465 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4728466 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4728467 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4728468 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4728469 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4728470 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4728471 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4728472 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4728473 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4728474 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4728475 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4728476 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4728477 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4728478 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4728479 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4728480 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4728481 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4728482 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4728483 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4728484 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4728485 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4728486 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4728487 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4728488 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4728489 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4728490 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4728491 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4728492 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4728493 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4728494 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4728495 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4728496 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4728497 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4728498 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4728499 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4728500 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4728501 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4728578 im not ruling out an easing of the governments position
4728579 the 21 per cent increase to bring our pay up to the national benchmark doesnt have to be 7 per cent each year ms haythorpe said yesterday
4728580 for example if the government wanted to offer 5 6 and 10 per cent over the next three years we would present that offer to our members for acceptance
4728581 if the government also separated the new funding model from the enterprise bargaining process then we could avoid further industrial action and disruption to teachers students and parents she said
4728582 i believe the governments intransigence is purely a fiscal decision because the longer they take to resolve it the more money they save she said
4728583 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people

4728585 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4728586 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4728587 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis

4728696 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4728697 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question

4728732 studies in methodology in textual criticism on the new testatement
4728733 so many muslims have this belief that everything between the two covers of the koran is just gods unaltered word
4728734 they like to quote the textual work that shows that the bible has a history and did not fall straight out of the sky but until now the koran has been out of this discussion the only way to break through this wall is to prove that the koran has a history too
4728735 if the text was a message sent to the arabs of the seven century then of necessity it was formulated in a manner which took for granted historically specific aspects of their language and culture
4728736 mereka memandang al quran setidaknya sampai pada tingkat perkataan bukanlah teks yang turun dari langit surga dalam bentuk kata kata aktual sebagaimana pernyataan klasik yang masih dipegang berbagai kalangan tetapi merupakan spirit wahyu yang disaring melalui muhammad dan sekaligus diekspresikan dalam tapal batas intelek dan kemampuan linguistiknya
4728737 studies on the mohammedan religion and the needs and opportunities of the mohammedan world from the standpoint of christian missions
4728738 dengan pembongkaran ini kajian atas al quran menjadi semakin menarik merangsang perdebatan ini melahirkan konsep baru yang radikal terhadap eksistensi al quran
4728739 dan dia muhammad saw tidak menyampaikan sesuatu kecuali dari wahyu yang diwahyukan kepadanya
4728740 that is why if we are to understand what the new testament texts were meant to say by the authors when they were first written we must first understand the historical situation in which they were first written
4728741 apalagi sebagian besar tafsir dan ilmu penafsiran yang diwarisi umat islam selama ini sadar atau tidak telah turut melanggengkan status quo dan kemerosotan umat islam secara moral politik dan budaya
4728742 kendati ia harus diseret ke pengadilan dan diharuskan bercerai dengan istrinya karena dianggap keluar dari islam namun gairah intelektual tak pernah menyurutkan dirinya untuk berkarya
4728743 buku ini merupakan salah satu sayap penafsiran radikal yang menolak al quran didekati secara dogmatis ideologis sebagai sanggahannya penulis melakukan pembongkaran atas konsep teks dan wahyu melalui metode analisis teks

4728789 the adoption of the project is important for the football fans to be present at their favorites meeting
4728790 we still have no information about how many turkish football fans would like to attend the game
4728791 we have received no applications from the turkish football federation yet
4728792 the activitys goal is to inform the public about the sky and change superstitions about events in space
4728793 about 1 000 people watched the perseid meteor shower on tuesday at the observatory in ankara we expect that many visitors again on saturday to experience the lunar eclipse in what feels like an open air cinema
4728794 tehran is playing for time they are waiting for the elections in the united states and especially they are counting on the democratic candidate barack obama
4728795 first there is no guarantee that obama will keep his word second those who are in favor of a military solution might press for a strike before obama comes to power
4728796 there too could be miscalculation as they are so much at odds with the americans on the caucasus issue they might prefer to have a less assertive position on the nuclear row
4728797 as a neighbor we did our share and told the iranians about the consequences of their policy
4728798 bla bla kommentare 1 geben da schon mehr zu denken
4728799 we reached more than 110 000 people directly with this project we gave workshops on human rights and preventing domestic violence of over 2 500 women and children around turkey
4728800 most children had heard about human rights but they did not know what that means we made workshops in every terminal with children by playing games with them
4728801 not only have children learned that they have rights but also their families watching the workshops in curiosity heard about human and childrens rights
4728802 h rriyet freedom is our right and the train is h rriyet
4728803 we found a surprising crowd in each province and we realized that national media do not pay enough attention to the problems and wishes of anatolia
4728804 we have prejudices about the eastern and southeastern provinces of turkey but all that changed for me after the h rriyet train project
4728805 it was all our prejudices to believe in that i was comfortable there wearing my everyday clothes and people were amazingly friendly i realized that city life makes us isolated and nervous
4728806 the visits and play were supposed to be the same in each terminal but it was different as people were welcoming us with excitement in each station
4728807 when people heard that we were sleeping on the train they insistently invited us to their house they were indeed sincere
4728808 we observed that there is a huge potential in terms of people and resources in anatolia that we should not underestimate
4728809 we want to show the tolerance in turkey as well as the cultural richness of our land
4728810 we only have a demand and hope to get positive consequences
4728811 i was impressed by the way zk k has lived in damascus and thought about two things this money either comes from drug trafficking or secret services having seen the luxurious lives and man woman relations within the organization ive realized that the aim is not to serve the public i decided to surrender when understood that the organization was aware of my thoughts and was following me
4728812 no doubt he is an intelligent man his mind works quickly he never hesitated when giving answers although this does not mean he does not leave some aspects of questions unanswered
4728813 ahmadinejad claimed that if turkey and iran could work together in political economic and technological areas middle east problems would be solved
4728814 but when asked which specific topics he was referring to he avoided giving a straight answer
4728815 he seems to have a grasp of everything going on around the world
4728816 ahmadinejad told us that american thesis on the world order has collapsed and the world is aware of it
4728817 he seemed also very relaxed and without any stress when asked about possibility of an american attack on iran he answered that the u s could not lift a finger upon events in georgia and dismissed any possibility of armed attack
4728818 ahmadinejad argued that a u s fall is near he said american economy is in turmoil and it fails to protect even protect its own allies like georgia he even seemed happy about georgia
4728819 we wanted a project that was more than just a one day
4728820 we wanted to show that pawi is an active member of its community so we wanted a project that would promote our place in the turkish community and create a foundation for ongoing activism
4728821 we want to help reduce the amount of waste that comes from the excessive use of plastic shopping bags
4728822 we hope to connect with other local womens organizations by raising funds through the sale of the bags which we can then donate to those organizations
4728823 by collaborating with ipwin professional women will have more outlets to find support in their community it will also open up more opportunities to build the capacity and leadership of our members
4728824 pawi believes in supporting women from all backgrounds in their professional and personal development
4728825 when we learned about iwis new initiative to support international professional women we immediately thought it would be a win win opportunity to collaborate with them
4728826 it is not just for all the income of a university to be generated from students this is against the founding philosophy of the universities
4728827 the greater burden is on the foundation supporting tobb et as the university does not aim to profit
4728828 if you guarantee sustainable development of the university it is not right to collect the whole amount of the budget from only the students
4728829 the criteria of the higher education board y k for measuring investment in students are not sufficient
4728830 our investments are much higher than their data beykent university invests in facilities too while y k only takes into account current expenditures
4728831 if the amount a foundation university invests per student is equal to the amount it receives from a student this means that university does not seek profit and is focused on success
4728832 although foundation universities are not nonprofit institutions they still have to act in accordance to keep revenues and expenditures in balance
4728833 foundation universities should not aim to profit private universities can have ytl 50 000 per year if they want
4728834 there is no mosque located between the building of ankara chamber of commerce or ato and mitk y we want to take into account the potential and need in the region in this respect
4728835 today people are not happy with the state of the world injustice wars and insecurity have taken peace away from the world brutality dominates human relations and its reasons are inappropriate moves of big countries
4728836 ready to fight against brutal force everywhere in the world
4728837 we will be happy as much as occupied lands are saved zionist regime is an artificial regime created by bringing people from other parts of the world and committing massacres zionist regime is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and miserable conditions of 5 million people
4728838 ottomans acted as a barrier to this wave but when the ottoman government collapsed attacks against the region started we need to solve the deep rooted problems of the middle east in the last 60 years three major wars broke out because of the zionist regime
4728839 regional countries must hold a referendum attended by muslims christians and jews
4728840 the zionist regime is about to reach its end world nations do not want this state its costs are too much for big powers
4728841 americans cut off their relations with us 28 years ago they imposed an embargo 11 years ago without a reason but despite their embargo we are now a nuclear state iran is about to launch its first homemade satellite in biotechnology we are in the worlds top five in nanotechnology we are in the top 10 all these were made possible with u s embargo naturally we wish that the embargo continues
4728842 two years ago i had a talk with american officials in a council of foreign relations they asked everything about irans nuclear program one of the americans told me that nuclear power is our right but he added that if we have it turkey saudi arabia and egypt will demand it too i told them everyone can use nuclear power if it is right to do so if it is not you should stop using it too
4728843 i never said such a thing should we fall to the position of the u s what i said was that the u s power in the region is eroding and it must go away from the middle east then regional countries should fill the power vacuum regional states must provide security for iraq and its territorial integrity
4728844 turkeys eu accession is beneficial to the eu and to the region because turkey is a big country and acts as a bridge
4728845 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible
4728846 as you know issues like natural gas and petroleum need investment and talks on these issues may take a long time
4728847 it was not something i decided in my country i never order the blocking of roads maybe zionist terrorist activities disturbed them
4728848 islam is beyond geography and beyond politics i show that i am with turkish people with this prayer which has a political meaning
4728849 we gave the reports given by the dutch officials to the court and the police
4728850 these documents openly certify that the protocol which di li signed is a proof of a bribe it is a document of shame
4728851 what we do at vinotolia is slightly different from companies in other countries
4728852 we offer enotourism within a historical concept basically we offer wine themed history and culture tours
4728853 of course our problem is we have difficulty putting turkey and wine together and selling the idea abroad
4728854 many foreigners see it as similar to taking a wine tour in morocco or tunisia we have to assure them that they are touring the worlds oldest wine producing lands
4728855 at the london wine fair last may many of our wines won medals yet any coverage only appeared in our own press the firms used the opportunity to increase their market share in turkey and so it didnt echo at all abroad
4728856 i wished to combine a personal interest in wine having toured many wine estates while abroad and my experience having worked as a multilingual tour guide for 20 years
4728857 legal action will be taken against the organizations directors for opening an unlicensed female dorm and for changing from an official male dorm against the law governing organizations
4728858 there was no information or documentation proving that there were any koran courses in the building there was never any permission given for courses in the building and a request to teach english was sent out after the explosion
4728859 history has shown us how dangerous women can be if their hearts are broken or if they are obsessed with power and ready to use their charm like an assassin uses his silenced gun to achieve it
4728860 when you look back you see a male dominated world those who conquered with their swords who opened and closed eras are mostly men does this mean that men always had the leading role in history there are such women who stood out in history who let it not be misunderstood those famous men could not help but sweat in the shadow of the greatness of these women
4728861 above all else popularity came first as seen in the case of mata hari and cleopatra
4728862 this yabancis ok shes our customer give her a good price
4728863 turkeys lira which unlike the brazilian real is not fortified by commodity exports has gained 45 5 percent against the dollar to maintain parity the dollar should have risen 53 7 percent
4728864 the actual problem is that there is no reason for the ytl to be that valuable against the dollar neither the inflation rate is low nor is the economy less fragile and the country is not experiencing export surplus moreover the external debt is still high
4728865 according to the classic real effective exchange rate calculation the ytl was overvalued 12 or 13 percent in the end of 2004 but as of june 2008 ytl is overvalued against dollar from 35 to 45 percent
4728866 as per a calculation relying on foreign trade figures of february 2008 the ytl is overvalued by 13 percent against dollar another calculation relying on the bilateral trade relations which are held on a dollar basis shows that the ytl is overvalued by 8 5 percent in the feer calculation the ytl is 7 percent more valuable than the dollar in this case 1 should be at least ytl 1 32
4728867 it is the people that make the difference hospitality and discipline are the key elements for a positive service culture that allows tourists to experience the turkish riviera as heaven on earth we teach our students the concept of holidaymaking
4728868 the guest has a right to be demanding our duty is to fulfill those demands that is the attitude we are trying to convey to our students
4728869 the best thing is however that people here laugh a lot i like that
4728870 the only new experience is that they are dealing with real guests here
4728871 each of us has to pass through every section of the hotel
4728872 most graduates work at one of the many five star hotels in antalya
4728873 the current trend however is for catering services and airlines
4728874 foreign languages have become more important than in the 1980s
4728875 back then our guests used to be mainly from turkey now the majority are coming from germany britain and since a few years ago from russia
4728876 of course they are not supposed to run fast and attentive service thats the objective
4728877 three to four glasses a day our staff are very careful
4728878 istanbul is such a city that it might be ranked among the top 10 countries with respect to the values of its buildings as the city boasts an advantageous geographic location and high trade volume
4728879 the land to construct new buildings in the central regions of istanbul is extremely limited and this situation necessitates the construction of new buildings in place of the existing old buildings in addition the historical and cultural heritage and tourist pull of istanbul are all pros of the city
4728880 the price per square meter of a building that targets middle income groups stands at 1 500 to 2 000 in istanbul currently meanwhile these levels reach approximately 18 000 in paris and reach 25 000 in some of the famous touristic islands of the world
4728881 the companies were concerned that they would encounter serious difficulties in the sale of the first stage of their residences however the sales have satisfied the expectations of the companies
4728882 however people opt to reside in these residences primarily because of their security services rather than the other luxury services
4728883 after this decision the market will now probably price in unchanged rates until the end of the year
4728884 oil prices have declined to near the optimistic end of the banks forecast range
4728885 fatah has showed its readiness to join a national committee to resolve the issue of political arrests by setting up a mechanism to release the prisoners
4728886 the main door flew open again and in walked some higher officers of the kgb including a highly decorated very short colonel the little colonel quickly reeled off a list of all czechoslovak communist party officials present and told us that he was taking us under his protection indeed we were protected sitting around that table each of us had a tommy gun pointed at the back of his head
4728887 history is returning in a big way and america has to cope with a new reality
4728888 the russians power play succeeded and is likely to have a great many implications
4728889 it is too late to be talking about oil as a global weapon
4728890 in israel and around the world people still think in terms of the energy crisis of the 1970s but oil is a fluid that can be transported relatively easily oil can be purchased from russia today from norway tomorrow and from saudi arabia next week gas on the other hand must be supplied via pipelines that cost billions of dollars to build gas pipelines must pass through several countries and are extremely dependent on local political conditions
4728891 natural gas which the europeans find very attractive because it is more environmentally friendly than oil has so far traveled from central asia to europe only via russia
4728892 of course oil also has its problems the fact that a sukhoi su 25 fighter jet almost hit the oil pipeline running from the caspian sea to the mediterranean sea is interesting the su 25 is a very sophisticated plane that could easily have bombed the pipeline indeed this doesnt seem like a miss but more like a message to the west dont mess with us
4728893 such as the nabucco pipeline to bring central asias natural gas by way of the caspian sea and georgia to the mediterranean we can forget about that project now russia has made that very clear russia did not invade kazakhstan but rather a small country that is a bottleneck between central asia and the west no one will want to take the risk of angering the russians again
4728894 several regimes in this region are wondering about where they are headed
4728895 americas blatant abandonment of its best friend in the region president saakashvili will certainly prompt a policy reevaluation in countries like azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan if until now these states were certain that it was in their best interest to befriend the americans and we saw how they responded to the war in afghanistan now they may think it more worthwhile to befriend iran or russia maybe these two states can protect them where the americans have failed from the point of view of u s foreign policy this conclusion has very negative repercussions the russian invasion of georgia exposed the europeans and americans bluff and left the georgians on their own i would even go so far as to say that maybe the presidents of afghanistan and iraq are already considering their next steps
4728896 the dream of democratizing the middle east has been shattered
4728897 a very similar crisis could develop in the crimean peninsula which now belongs to ukraine but used to belong to russia and has a large russian population now everyone realizes that the russians are serious the same thing could also happen in azerbaijan public opinion in those countries could change from pro western to not wanting to rankle the russian neighbor
4728898 both strategically and logistically now it will be much harder for america to operate in russias southern part diplomatically too russias voice will increasingly be heard
4728899 in recent years we have seen a deterioration in the human rights situation in russia
4728900 now it is clear that rising russian nationalism will extend beyond the countrys borders this weeks events also made it clear that the belief that only the u s can flex its muscles is mistaken they marked the end of an era in which the u s behaved like the only superpower it was interesting to follow the events on a split screen television showing both the amazing spectacle china organized for the opening of the olympic games and pictures from georgia we saw two new superpowers evincing different behavior of course but which completely undermine americas global hegemony we saw history in the making right before our eyes
4728901 the start of the twilight of americas sole world hegemony
4728902 the retaking of ossetia is a minor part of the russian campaign
4728903 more significant is the attack on georgia proper which reasserts russias hegemony over the caucasus and defies american superpowerdom
4728904 imagine if newly independent wales joined the warsaw pact this war is really a celebration of ferocious force in the realm of international power a dangerous precedent russia has demonstrated the limits of u s power and moscows historic destiny as regional and world superpower the empire has struck back and shaken the order of the world
4728905 the data suggests that with the average monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 33 924 a year median first home prices wont be staying at current levels for much longer
4728906 we are strong as rumeli fortress and nothing can collapse us moreover our commitments in turkey are very strong hence we will stay here in long years ahead
4728907 we are pleased with the banking sector in turkey and our investments here
4728908 global banks never make short term considerations while making investment decisions
4728909 image for these banks is a significant factor when deciding to enter or leave a market therefore it is not possible to see departures all of a sudden it would be very surprising to see a global player leave the market
4728910 the strategies could be changed if things do not go well but a market should not be quit
4728911 citibank does not transfer turkish profits out of the country we do not pay this sum to shareholders profits stay inside the country each year our capital adequacy ratio of 12 2 percent allows us to transfer profit out despite this profits are used each year for further investment
4728912 it wouldnt be surprising to see prices in these and other large western cities slump by as much as 20 percent in the near term in a market correction
4728913 you dont have to be an economist to predict that prices will go down in saskatoon and regina but in terms of the fundamentals all the pieces there are still fine a healthy economy energy boom and rising food prices
4728914 other than people who bought last year thinking prices would keep doubling over breakfast most people there in western canada should still end up ahead
4728915 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4728916 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in europe and pacific industrialised nations oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world oil demand growth the lowest since 2002
4728917 the bank had a profitable quarter as loans grew more than the sector average of 7 5 percent
4728918 a friend told me you might be interested in someone with my background i have insert your 2 sentence pitch and i have just a few questions for you
4728919 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4728920 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4728921 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4728922 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4728923 we dont want to cut relations with anyone but nevertheless ill tell you that we have fulfilled and will continue to fulfil our peacekeeping mandate if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4728924 well try to get this formal ceasefire in place because the goal of this is to get a ceasefire and to get russian forces to withdraw from the country asap as soon as possible
4728925 the gori police chief is in the town trying to hold negotiations on the handover of the city
4728926 you have so much in common you have an old greek house on a turkish island and she has an old turkish house on a greek island
4728927 this is a small village but were fine we have lots of peace and quiet
4728928 why do i need independence when most of the day i do not have electricity at home
4728929 the status issue was used as a magic wand which would solve all problems
4728930 must energetically face the main problems of society or else face social unrest by the same people who celebrated independence on february 17
4728931 we have approved an economic program which is meant to improve the situation
4728932 managing these expectations and pursuing reforms are now the biggest challenges for the government in the months to come
4728933 extremists and attempts to undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of kosovo
4728934 we have the political will for them the serbs to be integrated into kosovos society
4728935 only way out of this situation is through economic integration where both parties will have an interest to cooperate so that trust can be created on both sides
4728936 the political situation is so tense that the serbian side sees no interest in taking part in kosovo public life
4728937 kosovo cannot be seen as precedent for any other situation in the world today
4728938 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4728939 the first explosion happened around 7pm and as the people fled the scene about five minutes later i heard another bomb
4728940 we do not have enough women police to search the pilgrims
4728941 during the day it is possible to identify them but at night it is more difficult because of the burqa sometimes you cannot even tell if they are men or women
4728942 he has no guts i dont think he needs to care about what china and south korea think
4728943 our country has inflicted great pain on many nations especially those in asia on behalf of the japanese people i express my condolences and deep regret to all the victims
4728944 i am not in charge here in iran i would not allow that to happen
4728945 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4728946 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4728947 we have an interest in the peace process we think its good for the people of south asia
4728948 i have personally conveyed my concern and disappointment to the government of pakistan
4728949 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4728950 but in taking these steps we need to keep in mind that we do not do anything which hurts the growth rate
4728951 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4728952 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4728953 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4728954 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4728955 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4728956 we would start with a battery under u s command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4728957 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4728958 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4728959 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4728960 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4728961 this statement was unacceptable coming from the lips of the representative of a country whose actions we are aware of concerning civilian populations
4728962 the russians should realize that the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe is over
4728963 the fall of the roof was exactly on the spot where the european christian democrats whose policies are anti turkish sit traditionally
4728964 the proposal titled protecting the youth is an individual task prepared by s zen without taking opinions of the partys authorities and therefore without being approved by them the task was not prepared in compliance with the party program and regulations neither was it prepared in line with political tendencies of party members moreover its content does not comply with akps party regulations and party program thus the draft called protecting the youth by ms s zen is not approved by akps authorized members
4728965 has not the death penalty in turkey already been lifted
4728966 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
4728967 do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia
4728968 learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
4728969 a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing
4728970 president sarkozy has landed in paris holding in his hand a piece of paper guaranteeing peace in our time
4728971 we are faced with a resurgent major power with imperialist megalomaniacal ambitions led by the most effective leader in the world today
4728972 ladies and gentlemen i find this terribly reminiscent of the 1930s
4728973 when a column begins like this the author has got to be a neoconservative pushing for the next war
4728974 disregard the hysterical diatribes of georgian president mikheil saakashvilis american champions who protest too much perhaps because their irresponsible encouragement of the georgian president was a contributing factor on the road to the war
4728975 nato was given a gift in not having made georgia a member
4728976 the excuses that hitler used to swallow czechoslovakia and poland
4728977 looks strikingly like jimmy carter when the russians invaded afghanistan
4728978 the technical problem here is that fact that the boat overturned and its propeller hit something before hitting the water the cause will be known after the technical investigation
4728979 there is not a place of worship in schools in germany
4728980 even the top court banned the religious symbols from being displayed in classes s zen purposely tries to mislead the public and aims to convert the national education system into a religious one
4728981 our teams reprogramming method eliminates the side effects of the treatment that means gene therapy will be safer than before when we talk about the gene therapy the treatment of many diseases including cancer and liver diseases becomes possible
4728982 it is a historical building and it should be renovated we will do anything until the high school is restored
4728983 i am neither sunni nor shiite i am a muslim
4728984 its the best feeling in the world i dont think any father could describe it after all the work weve done especially since its 20 years since i competed in an olympic games and i came second
4728985 im still fighting for that medal count with him he has four so i have a few more to go
4728986 its an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him there on the floor exactly 20 years after he competed
4728987 before the olympic games i made a little board with pictures and things that inspire me and put it in my room
4728988 one day my mom came up there and she brought his olympic medal and hung it up there next to it so i saw it every day when i woke up so it gave me that extra bit of motivation
4728989 i do feel a little bit more of an american than a russian but im very proud of my heritage
4728990 i go back at least once a year and visit my grandparents and family and friends that makes it really special for me and i guess when im there i feel a little bit more russian until i start speaking russian and people start to give me looks i have a little bit of an accent in russian i guess
4728991 i dont mind in which country im working in which country im training children
4728992 i love america america has given me many opportunities i dont think i would be able to achieve such results in russia 15 years ago at that time it was almost impossible
4728993 we love russia very much but we proudly represent the u s
4728994 no matter what the event is i want to win but it didnt happen
4728995 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4728996 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes i knew it was tight but not that tight
4728997 it just kind of flowed it just happened it felt great i just kept it strong and powered to the end
4728998 the last 15 i had plenty left in me i saw liesel behind and just pushed for the wall i didnt know what was going on i just went for it
4728999 full credit for her she kept working hard and driving through the wall
4729000 i was so thankful that i was in there in the first place and i got a lane
4729001 i just forgot about the pain and got ready for my next race
4729002 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win
4729003 i felt a little sluggish but my body has woken up now
4729004 there are 100 specialists right now however only around 80 are actively working
4729005 the examination is canceled because the judicial process continues no institution is legally authorized to administer the exam right now
4729006 now the exam is done by the sym there are only a few problems left about the staff
4729007 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4729008 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4729009 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4729010 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4729011 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4729012 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4729013 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4729014 weve got some people in their 30s playing weve got teachers people working with banks auditing firms foreign businesses a lot of young people who are not married yet
4729015 they didnt need another sport but what they saw was a lot of good people having fun
4729016 and to add to that you have guys and girls playing together with no referee and its still competitive i would say that its that community friendship based atmosphere while at the same time being competitive
4729017 thats a completely new experience for most people not just in turkey but in most cultures
4729018 whether you win or lose is not most important to enjoy the game and friendship are the most important things in t rk kas and in ultimate
4729019 wed go and throw and try and get other people to come and play with us
4729020 eventually we were able to get enough people that were interested to start organizing a regular weekly game
4729021 its a cool way to branch out and to be with turks who speak english
4729022 but we came out and tied one game lost several by one point and won our last game we felt like we had won the tournament
4729023 we have so many people on our team that are into this and they would love to keep this going
4729024 we want to make this a turkish sport and we want to make this a coed sport
4729025 weve always played co ed at t rk kas because thats what makes us unique that adds to the spirit of the game and that adds to the fun
4729026 combining the non stop movement and athletic endurance of soccer with the aerial passing skills of american football a game of ultimate is played by two seven player squads with a high tech plastic disc on a field similar to football the object of the game is to score by catching a pass in the opponents end zone a player must stop running while in possession of the disc but may pivot and pass to any of the other receivers on the field ultimate is a transition game in which players move quickly from offense to defense on turnovers that occur with a dropped pass an interception a pass out of bounds or when a player is caught holding the disc for more than ten seconds ultimate is governed by spirit of the game a tradition of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the players rather than referees ultimate is played in more than 42 countries by hundreds of thousands of men and women girls and boys
4729027 i hope that the delegates will support me and my friends tuesday on our quest for the success of turkish football
4729028 i am very happy with the great support and the interest shown in me
4729029 this support proves that we have been doing the right things since hasan do an was elected last february now the same team will continue under my presidency
4729030 football and sport in general is a way of strengthening friendship
4729031 we will go to armenia and they will come here tensions may be high but we will go there to play football politics is not our job
4729032 its great for chris hes going for three golds here
4729033 i decided to take these two weeks off from tournament golf as with automatic qualification now out of the question i thought it very important to put in some serious practice time so i am ready to perform to the best of my ability should i come into the reckoning for a captains selection
4729034 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
4729035 after these few days with my wife and family i am ready to get down to some serious hard work at gleneagles which is no more than 10 minutes from home so some long hours can easily be put in
4729036 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event
4729037 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
4729038 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
4729039 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
4729040 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you
4729041 they are trying to learn the turkish culture they are joining folklore groups and folklore dances going to turkish classes and doing joint bazaars
4729042 they are really trying to mix and i think its working really well
4729043 its very difficult for me to give you proper numbers because unfortunately everyone isnt registered
4729044 normally they bring all their friends back they are speaking so well of turkey that there are more and more people that want to come and settle here
4729045 i had many opportunities to go but i love zmir i cant live without zmir
4729046 exaggerated and unplanned watering decreases the water level in the lake
4729047 alam ng publiko na madalas magpunta sa mindanao si kenney bilang kinatawan ng us para subaybayan ang interes ng kanyang bansa kabilang na ang direktang pamumuhunan puwersang militar at mga pekeng proyektong pangkaunlaran
4729048 in 2003 the us state department engaged the united states institute of peace to facilitate a peace agreement between the government of the republic of the philippines and the milf
4729049 because of its ability to deal with nonstate actors and sensitive issues underlying civil conflict usip can be a useful instrument for advancing us interests
4729050 the boats that anchor close to the coast cause reactions among vacationers in olimpos
4729051 because of this local and foreign tourists are complaining in order to overcome these complaints by tourists in previous years we pulled a ball cock a certain distance from the coast but because of the visual and noise pollution the ball cocks were removed
4729052 but we want the related authorities to take the necessary measures towards the owners and users of the boats that do not obey
4729053 paranoid that the kremlins hand is everywhere we risk underestimating the great patriotic rage of many ordinary russians who having been fed too much government propaganda in the last few days are convinced that they need to crash georgian web sites many russians undoubtedly went online to learn how to make mischief as i did within an hour they too could become cyberwarriors
4729054 under the proposal gazprom would retain its export monopoly status but would have to buy gas for exports from independent producers on a pro rata basis to their production
4729055 the belief that economic rationality always prevents war is an equally great illusion and todays high degree of global economic interdependence which can be sustained only if all major governments act sensibly is more fragile than we imagine
4729056 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4729057 we by no means are trying to fill the and ceo of summit entertainment
4729058 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4729059 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4729060 who invited the trouble here who invited the arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here not only those who perpetrated it but those who allowed it to happen
4729061 how long shall we stay in gori as long as we want to
4729062 we do feel let down do you blame us what happened to our allies we do not know what will happen in the future but it looks like we may lose parts of our country
4729063 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4729064 we have nothing left and we cannot go back home our lives have been destroyed and i do not think our government or america can change that
4729065 the last big kick of the night was the chinese zhang zhilei all 6 7 and 200 pounds of him
4729066 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4729067 after that there will be nobody else going out and we want one or two more coming in
4729068 and what we have to do is to make sure we get better players coming in than those who are going out and this will take some doing because they are quality players who are going out
4729069 as far as our signings have been concerned the quantity is low but the quality is very high
4729070 it had to be my day otherwise how can one think of defeating like likes of ralf christian and others
4729071 i did not do too well in the qualification but i was calm during the final and just went and did the best i could
4729072 i may have just won by 0 7 points but i won and that is important this gold medal is for my parents who are my inspiration i hope i can make them happy in future also
4729073 why not it is a good feeling to get medals
4729074 i will go to london and focus at the age of 50
4729075 this is my sixth olympics but every medal has the same excitement i think i was fifth after the qualification so to come back and finish second is wonderful

4729077 i couldnt have been asked to shoot against a better shooter
4729078 i hoped he wouldnt miss because tore and me are really good friends but i could feel the nervousness building inside me so i was hoping it wouldnt last much longer
4729079 winning an olympic gold was a dream and now i cant believe i have got it i would not trade a minute of it
4729080 the game plan was to hit every shot if you are perfect nobody can beat you
4729081 i just cant wait to get home to my family and get a big pat on the back i guess

4729088 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4729089 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4729090 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4729091 russias actions in georgia raise serious questions about its role and its intentions in the europe of the 21st century
4729092 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the west
4729093 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4729094 die zvs m chte sich bei ihnen f r ein versehen entschuldigen
4729095 bitte beachten sie das allein der bescheid der ihnen auf dem postweg zugehen wird rechtsverbindlich ist
4729096 es tut uns sehr leid dass wir ngste und emotionale achterbahnfahrten ausgel st haben
4729097 ein schlechtes semester f r uns auch wenn sich das etwas arrogant anh rt
4729098 zo kreeg een vrouw met een interimcontract een vaste baan aangeboden maar besliste het bedrijf haar toch niet in dienst te nemen toen bleek dat ze zwanger was
4729099 anderen werden dan weer ontslagen op de eerste dag na de beschermde periode na hun zwangerschapsverlof
4729100 im actually kind of nervous and the reason why is that i think about what we did last year as a whole unit
4729101 were going to try to come out and put points on the board because thats what were coached and asked to do but the expectation the bar is set so high here not by you all not by the fans but by the coaches and the team
4729102 we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year i dont think we can really live and dwell off that because that was last year
4729103 like i said its a little bit of nervousness because i know how high the bar is here
4729104 i just think that first and foremost we have some unfinished business
4729105 i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room on the field weve got a great group of guys in the locker room i think thats all you can ask for and coaching coach belichick understands football and understands his players and really puts us together as one we come together as a team and thats what you can definitely respect playing in this profession playing in this league
4729106 the good thing that i can really say about our offense and im speaking for myself is that you had guys that came in late myself chad jackson was hurt last year and wes welker coming in last year so for us to have a whole offseason a training camp to really understand the offense and the concept is really scary
4729107 we will make that decision between now and when we leave today
4729108 i want to let them go through a week of practice and see how it goes it is possible if they are practicing then it is possible
4729109 yeah thats it youve got to give a little and take a little

4729112 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4729113 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4729114 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4729119 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4729120 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4729121 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4729122 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4729123 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4729124 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4729125 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world

4729129 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4729130 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4729131 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4729132 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4729133 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4729134 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4729135 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4729136 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4729137 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4729138 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4729139 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4729140 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4729141 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4729142 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4729143 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him

4729189 ive been in politics for 20 years and for 20 years ive had barbra streisand trying to do my job so i decided to try my hand at her job
4729190 rick warren is taking a fling at my job so i thought id try my hand at his
4729191 i have a small bone to pick with you on this post
4729192 invariably when you mention a statistic you cite the source
4729193 i want to go out there and show them what im made of
4729194 it feels pretty special to assure canadas first medal i know we have more coming but its nice to be the first one
4729195 i was a little nervous and heavy on my feet in the semifinal but i just kept wrestling whoever stops wrestling first is the one to lose
4729196 my parents are both here to watch me and theyll be proud to be both chinese and canadian
4729197 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is
4729198 we can bring a massive level of creativity and british ness in the very best sense of the word and fun lets have a bit of fun with this
4729199 there are lots of things i think we can do which are quite instinctive to us anyway what does the world know about us were actually quite good at partying lets turn it into a giant party
4729200 the very best around at arranging pop concerts and directing west end shows and theyre british
4729201 they looked at that and thought thats really good but we can do something as good set in a different context
4729202 they were more pumped up because it was so good i think they were quite excited by the challenge
4729203 this is amazing its fantastic its clearly been choreographed to within an inch of its life
4729204 but my judgment is youll not see another games like this again
4729205 you cant build the velodrome there its where my allotment is
4729206 it wont continue to go in this direction it wont at london and it wont at chicago or wherever is next

4729217 schreiben sie ein gutachten f r eine sehr gute studentin
4729218 die akw ausbau offensive rund um sterreich nimmt in den vergangenen jahren immer gr ere ausma e an w hrend die vp als verantwortliche regierungspartei entweder keine antworten hat oder keine haben will molterer und pr ll m ssen jetzt ihre strategie vorlegen wie und mit welchen schritten sie diesem ausbau wahnsinn begegnen wollen sich nur auf die beteiligung an den jeweiligen umweltpr fungen auszureden ist definitiv zu wenig
4729219 wer heutzutage kinder bekommt berlegt sehr genau und verantwortungsbewusst ob er sie ihnen auch optimale startvoraussetzungen f r eine chancenreiche zukunft bieten kann zu diesen voraussetzungen geh rt eine gute kinderbetreuung die auch au erhalb des elternhauses h chsten anspr chen gerecht wird und die f r alle eltern leistbar ist deshalb muss der kindergartenbesuch f r kinder von drei bis sechs jahren inklusive mittagstisch kostenlos und auf freiwilliger basis m glich sein
4729220 erst wenn es ein fl chendeckendes qualitativ hochwertiges angebot in allen gemeinden gibt eltern ihre kinder mittags mit einem warmen essen gut versorgt wissen und der kindergartenbesuch sie nicht vor finanzielle h rden stellt kann von echter wahlfreiheit die rede sein
4729221 f r die zukunft unseres landes wird es entscheidend sein wie viele junge menschen eines tages die grundlage der wertsch pfung erarbeiten da die geburtenzahlen sinken und reine geldleistungen hier keine nachhaltige nderung bewirkt haben sollte die politik jetzt alles tun um familienfreundliche rahmenbedingungen in unserer gesellschaft zu schaffen die es eltern erleichtern den nachwuchs gro zu ziehen und in der kinder aus allen sozialen schichten gleiche zukunftschancen haben
4729222 arme jungw hler wenn sie mit derart krausen ideen wie den eingriff in bestehende pensionen eines

4729224 wenn herr kurz in sozialistischer manier glaubt dies durch k rzung der sogenannten
4729225 ich fordere herrn kurz auf sich daf r einzusetzen dass seine unternehmerfreunde sozialversicherungsbeitr ge die sich bereits in millionenh he angeh uft haben endlich einzahlen bisher wurde dies von den arbeitgebern in den sozialversicherungsgremien durch endlose stundungen bzw beitragsnachsichten hintertrieben
4729226 ich erwarte mir von vp chef molterer ein klares bekenntnis zum bestand der pensionen nach der wahl im september
4729227 sterreichs senioren sind f r konstruktive vorschl ge zur sicherung ihres hart erarbeiteten lebensabends durchaus aufgeschlossen verbieten es sich jedoch entschieden durch derart unausgegorene
4729228 alle bisherigen erfahrungen zeigen uns dass man uns nicht ernst nimmt und das wundert mich nicht vp kanzler sch ssel hat alles dazu getan um sterreichs interessen im zusammenhang mit temelin in prag billig zu verkaufen
4729229 ich h tte mir gew nscht dass gespr che zum erfolg f hren bisher war das leider nicht der fall daher bleibt dieses veto als ultima ratio

4729261 we just want our kids to know how harmful drinking is at their age due to the continuing development of their brain among other things
4729262 there is so much new data that shows exactly how much alcohol damages a young persons brain
4729263 in fact kids usually listen to their parents more than anybody else including their friends
4729264 the brain goes through dynamic change during adolescence ages 12 to 21 and alcohol can seriously damage long and short term growth processes
4729265 the pre frontal area responsible for good judgment and impulse control undergoes the most change during adolescence
4729266 researchers found that adolescent drinking could cause severe changes in this area which plays an important role in forming adult personality and behavior damage from alcohol at this time can be long term and irreversible
4729267 we cant count on law enforcement because while they do a great job with our kids these kids think they can get away with anything and our data supports that
4729268 what we need to do is find a way to stop this problem before the police have to become involved before it is their responsibility we have to get our children to make the right decisions

4729295 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4729296 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4729297 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4729298 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4729299 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4729300 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4729301 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof
4729302 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
4729303 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4729304 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4729305 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4729306 ada beberapa pertanyaan yang saya ajukan dalam diskusi itu tidak dijawab oleh andaryoko sehingga saya meragukan sekali keterangannya kalau dia itu supriyadi

4729311 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday
4729312 unlike the others id do anything im not the same i have no shame
4729313 es wird nicht passieren wenn man deshalb kommt wird man entt uscht werden
4729314 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4729315 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4729316 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4729317 who gives a hit the bong and chill the out listen to the final countdown for crying out loud
4729318 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4729319 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4729320 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4729321 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4729322 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4729323 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4729324 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4729325 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4729326 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4729327 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4729328 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4729329 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4729330 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4729331 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4729332 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4729333 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4729334 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4729335 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4729336 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4729337 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4729338 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4729339 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4729340 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied

4729352 there is still limited access to treatment for example my neighboring country zimbabwe it might be politically unstable but there are people on the ground who are suffering and because of sanctions that are being imposed funders are not going to zimbabwe at the end of the day its the lives of individuals and i hope the theme of universal access is really put into practice

4729374 this report makes clear that the snp cannot use the money to bridge the fiscal gap and set up a scottish oil fund before alex salmond can ask the scottish people about independence he has to be honest about what the government would use north sea tax revenue for
4729375 scotland will have a budget surplus of at least 4 billion to 5 billion
4729376 the recent gers report welcomed by the snp for the first time shows that even using the maximum possible figure for oil revenues scotlands fiscal deficit stands at 2 7bn
4729377 in order to make the snp figures add they dont count expenditure on capital projects once again the snp are making figures up to suit their own political agenda

4729413 if barbara wasnt able to be in stable condition i couldnt be here
4729414 we wanted to do something for the family but we didnt have enough time to put something on our jerseys
4729415 i hope the family can see that were playing hard for them as for hugh hes such an integral part of this team its so good to have him back
4729416 i know its hurt my guys and its great to get back to business as usual
4729417 im here now and im going to give everything ive got im confident extra confident that ill be able to do that
4729418 to be honest with you i thought it would be a little strange but it wasnt
4729419 in the ongoing battle with the mpaa and riaa there seems to be an ongoing argument about who is to blame
4729420 tuesday wasnt far off the kind of performance i want
4729421 walsall was always going to be a difficult place to go but the pitch was fantastic so we enjoyed passing the ball about on there when we turned up and saw the pitch we thought fantastic i said if we cant play football on that then we never will
4729422 wed been the better side before walsall scored the first goal and after that goal we kept passing and kept doing the right things
4729423 to be fair the whole team passed it they moved they caused walsall problems and our two wide men were excellent
4729424 the wide men are key they have to work up and down the wings and have quality on the ball too neil wainwright had the work rate but i dont think he had the quality of these two pooley and griff
4729425 having balance helps having natural right and left footers and having plenty of energy thats what you want in your wide men its the hardest position on the pitch
4729426 we tried to set a good tempo in the first half last saturday and i think we did that in the second half for whatever reason we didnt keep the tempo up but how we played at walsall is how we want to play home and away
4729427 hopefully the new players are getting used to that and the wide men worked their socks off on tuesday
4729428 it was a good performance from us weve got to carry that on saturday i dont think anyone really needs a boost in confidence but to perform like we did on tuesday certainly helps us
4729429 proudlock is getting fitter and sharper and as you can see billy is a class player
4729430 with his goal he had to stay composed because the ball was dropping out of the sky and its easy with them chances to blast it over the bar but he made sure he hit the target
4729431 were delighted weve got him and i hope we can keep hold of him as long as we can

4729433 of all the worlds exceptional kitchens perhaps none are as grand as the kitchen compound of the jagannatha temple in puri orissa that basks on indias eastern seaboard adjoining the bay of bengal the present temple of jagannatha was constructed by king ananga bhima historians say this temple was constructed at least two thousand years ago awesome and gigantic the jagannatha temple kitchen reflects centuries if not millenia of culinary tradition without electricity or machines a legion of skilled chefs work under oil lamps over open wood fires every day since the temple was inaugurated over twenty centuries ago the temple chefs have prepared more than one hundred different vegetarian dishes in enormous quantities to be offered to the temple deities and then distributed as prasadam sanctified food the kitchen runs so efficiently that given only one days notice the chefs can prepare a full meal for ten thousand guests at a sitting the kitchen compound is located several feet above and to the left of the temples main gate called the simha dvara or lion gate and covers roughly one acre the kitchen is divided into nine sections two of them a little more than 2 500 square feet each the other seven slightly smaller the kitchen houses an astounding 752 wood burning clay stoves called chulas each about three feet square and four feet high to accomodate various sizes of pots small clay knobs are judiciously placed at intervals on the stoves surface for support a circle of five jug shaped earthen pots rest directly on the stoves surface kept in place with the clay knobs three more pots go in the open spaces above the pots to form a second layer and one more pot goes in the centre on top forming a nine pot pyramid in this way all nine pots receive lickings of heat and smoke from the wood fires below some cooking pots also made of unfired clay are shallow and wide resembling spanish paella pans or french saute pans as the food cooks in the pots their walls become very hot the pots provide amazing heat retention food stored in them stays piping hot for up to four or five hours and tastes exceptionally delicious one thousand men are employed in the kitchen every day five hundred executive chefs called swaras are the only ones actually allowed to cook on the stoves three hundred kitchen assistants called jogunias assist the swaras by lighting the fires fetching water from temple wells washing and cleaning the new earthen cooking pots before use and finally filling the pots with ingredients the other two hundred assistants called tunias wash the cart loads of locally grown vegetables such as the many varieties of leafy greens tubers squashes melons green chilies ginger and fresh coconuts the tunias also cut the vegetables grate the fresh coconuts into powder and stone grind the herbs chilies ginger and dozens of spice blends all members of the kitchen staff begin training at age twelve they serve for life or until they become too old to perform their duties the one hundred different dishes prepared daily fall into two categories called pakka and sukka pakka foods are those which are boiled such as dals soups stews rice kiccharis and all vegetable dishes sukka or dry foods include cookies biscuits sweetmeats pastries and confections as with the fruits and vegetables selected for use in the jagannatha kitchens the standard for spices has also remained constant for two thousand years only locally grown spices are used and these include mace cumin fennel nutmeg cardamom cinnamon coriander mustard seed and black cumin although non hindus are strictly forbidden from entering the jagannatha temple or its kitchens visitors to jagannatha puris bustling markets can purchase a huge variety of temple kitchen prasadam for a small price some still hot and in its original clay cooking pots

4729439 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
4729440 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
4729441 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
4729442 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
4729443 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom

4729445 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
4729446 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
4729447 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
4729448 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
4729449 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful

4729456 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
4729457 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
4729458 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed

4729503 uniformed and plainclothes police are hanging around to keep public order mainly but they are also watching us
4729504 im here making a bit of money on the side
4729505 they picked on the foreigners and there are not that many of us left
4729506 but im thinking of leaving the beijing olympics the police are getting a bit annoying
4729507 i have to be honest we had a few touch and go moments
4729508 ive had sciatica pain down my leg for the week
4729509 i just said i didnt want to know what the options were and all that sort of stuff
4729510 i didnt care i wasnt going to go through the thing like 2000 again it wasnt an option
4729511 at the start of the week there were a few hairy moments where we didnt know where it was going to go
4729512 so we havent really rowed apart from the races we were just about having the best row of our lives
4729513 from a week ago and whats happened in the week weve had a lot of highs and lows in emotions and thoughts
4729514 drew obviously didnt want to talk about it too much in terms of how bad it was and i didnt want to ask him about it
4729515 i wanted him to row and it wasnt really an option planning to row with anyone else
4729516 for him to do what hes done with the injury hes had has been awesome
4729517 to get through the week in the minimal amount of work that weve done has been great
4729518 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday
4729519 the snow conditions were so deep up to chest level on several of the people they just could not make any progress
4729520 i suppose youd say its mixed emotions through the group some of them extremely relieved to be down here others you know annoyed that we required rescuing
4729521 you just start telling stories i mean im a plumber so i started telling them gross stories of things ive had to do over the years so that keeps people occupied

4729536 es un fen meno en alza que genera preocupaci n y que merece una respuesta aunque esta va a tardar a n unos meses
4729537 cuando preguntamos a las empresas c mo han obtenido los datos muchas responden que lo hacen de forma aleatoria y por tanto no podemos decir que ah haya un dato personal en riesgo
4729538 los datos se pueden utilizar solo para el fin que se han solicitado y si se ha dado el m vil como tel fono de referencia no se deber a recibir sms lo que ocurre es que la ley prev que si existe una relaci n comercial previa la empresa puede ponerse en contacto con sus clientes
4729539 para enviar publicidad al m vil lo m s correcto ser a que al pedir los datos se incluyera una casilla preguntando al usuario qui n lo hace casi nadie para enviar sms publicitarios se usan muchas listas fr as aquellas que han sido obtenidas por un proveedor que las ha revendido a un tercero pueden ser datos legalmente obtenidos si la empresa lo ha indicado con una advertencia o disclaimer
4729540 si haces bien las cosas en publicidad m vil no tiene por qu haber spam
4729541 las bases de datos de m viles son muy dif ciles de conseguir y la mayor a solo se logran por v a de dar servicios
4729542 la empresa siempre se tiene que identificar y el usuario tiene que poder decir que no quiere recibir mensajes al menos a trav s de una p gina web la ley no lo dice as pero creo que es una cuesti n de buenas pr cticas
4729543 muy poca gente pincha en los mensajes que incluyen un enlace a una web porque tiene miedo de lo que le van a cobrar por la navegaci n

4729557 the people who follow these sports between olympics they recognize the great performances

4729559 and im sorry but im not going to apologize to anyone for helping the canadian military see the game
4729560 i dont know of many nfl teams that have a full house in the pre season i watched the bills first exhibition game in washington and the stadium was half full and thats a team that has about 17 000 names on a waiting list for seasons tickets
4729561 one thing i would like to comment on are the claims that there were not many fans from buffalo
4729562 our intention was not to lure fans from buffalo this was about the people of toronto being able to see an nfl game here
4729563 i guarantee there will not be an empty seat for that game
4729564 and the full house will not be a result of free tickets either
4729565 we have seen the number of people coming to our advice services with mortgage arrears problems treble in the last two years

4729586 certainly over the past few years there was much foolish lending that had led to severe losses and the economy will suffer in the short run but actions by central banks will assure that this credit crisis does not morph into a full blown recession or worse and in the long run saner lending and more reasonable home prices will lead to a stronger economic recovery
4729587 the best case scenario is a mild recession and a slow recovery that s the best ocutcome we can hope for

4729595 i dont care with all those limits as long as i dont think that there is a limit it will never be there
4729596 the hardest part for me was realizing i sign in before you can post messages
4729597 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4729598 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4729599 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4729600 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4729601 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4729602 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4729603 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4729604 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4729605 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4729606 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4729607 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4729608 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4729609 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4729610 will start people to open their minds and hearts and to think about whats occurred in history and the ramifications of it
4729611 if i can get enough people i will write the president of the united states
4729612 my people were slaves several thousand years ago maybe i should have asked for an apology from egypt i dont know
4729613 i guess i have always been against oppression i have seen oppression against me so i understand that but i think to me as i get older i get less selfish
4729614 i was always very active through the mccarthy era when i tell you we were losing our freedom
4729615 and i helped break the blacklist because i hired dalton trumbo to write spartacus everybody said dont do it but i used his name on the screen at that time no one used a blacklisted writer
4729616 its wonderful because i am in contact with so many young people
4729617 and then i am fascinated about their reaction to me they know me they know how old i am and yet i have a contact with them i think that keeps me young
4729618 the hefty jump in mortgage carrying costs from earlier years
4729619 alberta continues to experience very low unemployment and overall prosperity
4729620 despite these positive factors the province is expected to face a drop in net migrants between now and the end of 2008 due in part to the increased house prices in alberta and improved labour market conditions in other provinces
4729621 an overhang of active listings in the competing resale market
4729622 coming off those really high years where we were expecting a fairly big drop anyway
4729623 theres slightly softer economic conditions in alberta still fairly high cost of living thats still posing some challenges for alberta in terms of attracting other people from other provinces
4729624 and thats going to weigh down housing starts a little bit more
4729625 also there might be a sense that well even in alberta things arent quite as good as they were a couple of years ago

4729701 the students know that they are not allowed to bring any electronic media like ipods cellphones or mp3 players to school when we made the rule we were trying to avoid such incidents
4729702 i fail to understand how the students can say such things about the people that are educating and empowering them

4729706 so sub standard in fact that the labels and embroidery on the athletics vests says
4729707 no one from sascoc is able to comment about the shoddy gear but it is clear the poorly made clothing and lacklustre fitting is going to have a major effect on the teams performance
4729708 while the worlds elite athletes will be dressed in the best and latest running gear available the south african team will be dressed like primary school cross country runners with parents on a budget
4729709 crocs sponsored team sa the national colour of the team is green and gold so sports south africa chose the green because they thought it was more suitable than the yellow goldy colour
4729710 the girls look like frumps in those hideous shapeless to the floor skirts that look more like sacks than clothing
4729711 the biggest no no though is the crocs horror of horrors the end result is east rand valley goes to margate
4729712 judging by how many south africans adorn their feet with those hideous crocs i think the choice may be truly representative of the people of our nation

4729719 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4729720 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process

4729740 the entire responsibility for the conflict for the cruel actions committed rests upon the shoulders of the georgian leadership
4729741 its amazing in this day and age that management is never asked to sacrifice
4729742 most of the members feel that the mbta should deal with the finan cial crisis that theyre facing right now then find a way to raise the salaries of executives

4729744 the number of unemployed could go down by 40 000 to an annual average of 3 234 million
4729745 you can go out side and have a fire at night and it does feel like camping
4729746 they want a sense of maybe being in the outdoors but not necessarily laying on the ground and dealing with all the critters and cooking over an open fire
4729747 you dont have to be a camper to experience camping

4729754 if id said yes she was ready to sign up for the meal plan
4729755 it is not camping but its basically saying you can kind of experience the idea of camping but not get dirty at all

4729767 i did a lot and paid a lot for this gold
4729768 im 33 years old and i made it to the finals in this beijing games i believe it was tenacity that got me this gold medal

4729801 the players are happy but you would expect us to be happy because we havent kicked a ball yet in the premier league

4729803 its three tough games in my opinion but three winnable games but its about the quality and mentality on the day
4729804 it is a good start for us but fulham will see that as a good start for them so were looking forward to it we know its going to be a hard game but were going into it with our eyes widely open and were excited about it
4729805 we have tried to block that gap and hopefully marlon will go some way towards doing that
4729806 at any level whether its the premiership or league one or the conference if youve got a goalscorer youve got a chance
4729807 marlons come in weve got big caleb obviously the evergreen dean windass we have got players who can put the ball in the back of the net but its up to us as individuals and as a team to create the chances for them

4729814 this camelot myth has formed around barack and michelle but they come from almost the opposite place in the world from the kennedys
4729815 if you saw barack on a yacht that would be pretty unseemly hes the guy from the basketball court who used to go around in jeans and a leather jacket in law school he was really uncomfortable with the markers of elitism like even dressing in a suit
4729816 whenever obama enters the room theres a sense of calm and satisfaction

4729848 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4729905 no one is in game design for the money what youre looking for is creative control we have an amazing creative environment so we have a very small amount of turnover compared to other games
4729906 and theres a plus side in that when people leave theyre generally at the top so it gives us a chance to promote people lower down who we hired because theyre really good and they then bring a new perspective
