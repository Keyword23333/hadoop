4640105 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4640106 he always knew he was going to do great things and guess what he did
4640107 there were times when i thought i might have to quit and go home and be with the family
4640108 not because i didnt think that i was able to play in the big leagues but maybe it wouldnt be with the giants
4640109 i can go on two days rest one day of rest or no days rest
4640110 i know how to prepare myself and i can throw through aches and pains
4640111 im not going to be a guy who blows 95 mph by somebody i work on movement
4640112 signing skipworth early was tremendous now he can go down in the gulf coast league get a bunch of at bats
4640113 we draft the best players we dont draft players that were sure will sign because if you do that youre going to miss out on some good talent
4640114 our philosophy is always to take the strength of the draft
4640115 there was a lot of pitching in this draft we fit our needs because we hadnt taken a lot of pitchers in the last two drafts this year there was an influx of pitching
4640116 his thumb is just sprained and there is no significant damage
4640117 when his mobility comes back and hes able to play hell play it is great news obviously he is still very sore when the 15 days are up well see where hes at
4640118 he just needs the time whether it is a week or 10 days or two weeks
4640119 my left hand is on the top of my right hand when i swing its pulling my thumb thats why it hurts
4640120 id like to see him maybe play a couple of ballgames somewhere and see how he gets through them and maybe join us on the next trip thats kind of my hope
4640121 he was doing just about everything you can ask getting on base seeing pitches playing the heck out of second base
4640122 to have another speed guy a solid defender all of those things youd like to get back very important
4640123 hes got a major league body delivery and arm action
4640124 his stuff is good now and we feel there is more to come
4640125 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4640126 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4640127 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4640128 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4640129 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4640130 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4640131 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4640132 get out of my way she has to go to the bathroom
4640133 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
4640134 ive had a good holiday but its fun to be back on the bike again today has started very well and i am very happy with my bike and with our tyres it seems the bridgestones are working very well here so far the new asphalt is good much better than last year and the grip improved throughout the day so i think that they have done a good job casey is strong again here so it looks like being a hard race but we have made a good start tomorrow it seems it could rain which is a pity but we have found a good setting today so hopefully even if it is wet then we will be in good shape on sunday we have some small engine modifications here to try but mostly we will wait until monday to try the new parts when we will have an important test
4640135 its good to be back in action weve made a good start and been fast all day weve tried quite a few different things and some different tyres with the aim of collecting as much information as possible in case it rains tomorrow of course we hope it doesnt but there is a chance it will be wet and so we wanted to make as much of today as we could so that we are prepared its been a positive day and we hope that we can continue like this
4640136 i am feeling very good physically and i only feel pain when i walk to the bike in the garage once im on it i am fine i am feeling confident but i need half a second more in order to be at the front the main problem is in the front tyre i am worried because the first michelin is in seventh and this isnt great it is clear that we all need to work together to improve this we are working very closely together with michelin and yamaha and we are trying to find a better way for us here this weekend it is very difficult at the moment to fight for the podium in the dry and in the wet we dont know yet my main aim this weekend is to finish in the top seven the new asphalt is better than last year so this is a good thing one more thing i want to say one of my mechanics juanito has just become a grandfather and so i want to say congratulations to him
4640137 we are quite lucky that jorges physical condition is good better than we expected and in fact its the least of our problems today our biggest issue is the confidence in the front end we dont have enough grip and jorge cant go into the turns fast enough furthermore the bike is understeering at full lean and therefore were losing a lot of time in the corners from the morning session we were able to improve our package but it wasnt enough to enable us to fight at the top tonight we will work closely with michelin to analyse data in order to help each other to improve our front grip problem
4640138 the new engine is awesome although it feels a little bit different than what ive been running what i had was obviously developed to the maximum and it was real smooth and real linear with the power delivery the new motor has a bit of a different feel but it is faster its a little bit peaky but its not hurting us at all so thanks to yamaha for rolling that over here to tech 3 we got some electronics stuff too so that is helping calm things down its just a little bit more aggressive on the throttle which the way im having too ride this bike is actually good at the moment with some of the small issues i have got with the front tyre the only way i can ride is brake as hard as i can and almost back it in like a supermoto and as soon as i get full lean angle i just roll to maximum throttle opening because i cant carry lots of momentum with 250 lines like i need to i need to get the rear to come round to steer the bike the rear tyre feels fantastic and im really happy with that i did 15 laps on a rear without any problems and good and consistent grip but the front tyre that i normally use and that i love it is good but only for a short distance ill sit down with my guys again tonight and talk things through with michelin to see if we can improve again tomorrow
4640139 it looks a little bit worse than it actually is because we have moved in a good direction with the set up and the new engine is fantastic so a massive thanks to yamaha for giving the team and me this level of support it just feels stronger and you seem to be getting through the gearbox a lot more progressively and it keeps on pulling once you get into fifth and sixth gear you see the red gear change light flash up a bit quicker than usual and up the hill you can certainly feel the bike is still pulling and it is a big improvement we have just got a lot of hard work to do with michelin now the track is cleaning up a little we are getting more life out of the tyre and the grip level is not so bad but we can still make it better and i am staying positive and trying to work as hard as i can with michelin when i ran off i just braked a bit too late down the hill i thought i was going to be able to stay on it but it high sided me in the gravel it was only a small tip off but then the chain fell off so i had to put that back on i cleaned it all off and i went quicker on the last two laps even with that but with the front tyre we are just trying to find a combination between having out and out grip and the endurance you can go as soft as you want to find some grip but you have also got to finish the 22 laps
4640140 i remind him that he went out with keira knightley not least
4640141 yes but i didnt go out with her to go to parties
4640142 i was 21 she was 18 we were fucking in english in the text in love it has last for 2 years and a half she is very intelligent very funny very easy to get on with

4640148 this test phase is the last stage in the evaluation of our hybrid solution ahead of production launch
4640149 since we presented our first concept vehicle in 2006 we have seen considerably heightened market interest in this technology what makes our solution unique is that it is sufficiently powerful to drive heavy vehicles and more cost effective than all other current alternatives it is these characteristics that determine whether a hybrid can be commercially viable we will start producing hybrid trucks in 2009
4640150 hybrid technology will play a major role in the future as the climate issue and oil dependency come into ever sharper focus
4640151 no matter which fuels dominate in the future their supply will be limited technology that leads to lower fuel consumption will be of immense interest to our customers irrespective of the type of haulage operation with which they work for distribution trucks fuel consumption may be able to be cut by 20 to 30 percent in long haul operations the percentage reduction will not be as great but since these trucks cover long distances the total fuel saving will nonetheless be considerable

4640670 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4640787 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4640788 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4640789 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4640790 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4640791 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4640792 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4640793 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4640794 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4640795 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4640796 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4640797 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4640798 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4640799 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4640800 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4640801 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4640802 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran

4640824 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there

4640838 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4640839 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4640840 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4640841 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4640864 the community is still strong in terms of economics and the employment is still good in petoskey
4640865 typically looking for a job is a full time job
4640866 how hard or easy it is really depends on a persons skill set and whether or not theyve taken advantage of any training or education
4640867 weve got a number of people who already came in to inquire about our services and we are beginning to get them scheduled for various appointments
4640868 this might be a year long process but its set up to give people a lot of help and in the end theyll be fine
4640869 in a very short period of time big big changes have occurred with respect to water levels throughout the great lakes region
4640870 the great lakes account for 20 percent of surface freshwater in the world and 90 percent of surface freshwater in the u
4640871 for these lakes the forecast is to be several inches above last years level however this will be 11 14 inches below the long term average through december according to the u s army corps of engineers june 2008 great lakes water summary
4640872 we dont know when well reach the tipping point until we hit it
4640873 more than one third of invasive species have entered the great lakes since the opening of the st lawrence seaway ballast is responsible for 77 percent of those introductions
4640874 the more and more congress doesnt act as more invasive species enter the great lakes the more people are calling for action such as closure of the st lawrence seaway
4640875 the united states spends 120 billion annually to control invasive species in the great lakes region alone we spend 5 billion from the zebra mussel alone exceeded 3 billion
4640876 economically we have a lot to lose if the great lakes change are right now
4640877 were lost more than one half of the original wetlands and two thirds of coastal wetlands in the great lakes basin
4640878 great lakes fish rely on coast wetlands at some point in their life cycle
4640879 if you cut you need a permit anything you do by hand does not require a permit as long as its minimal pulling of vegetation
4640880 there were 3 043 days of great lakes closings or advisories and 198 of those days were in michigan thats the same if not more beach closings than florida has although our season is shorter
4640881 since nonpoint source pollution doesnt come from one source but a number of different and diverse sources it can be reduced by voluntary actions by individuals and businesses
4640882 there has to be a balance between economic and agricultureal activity and protections even once we get laws enacted enforcement is an issue we need societal buy in
4640883 we hope to build stewardship of the lakes with individuals and businesses around the nation so theyll care about them as well as taking action to protect them
4640884 this is one of the first times this has happened where one product will be used along all branches of the armed forces
4640885 this plant has gone from 0 to 250 jobs in the last three to four years we expect that to probably maintain at that level depending on the level of demand from the government perhaps growing a little in the future

4640900 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4640916 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4640917 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4640918 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4640919 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me

4640922 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4640923 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
4640924 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
4640925 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up

4640977 this ice cream is simply wonderful not too sweet and with a pleasant slightly bitter aftertaste great on its own or paired with other flavors such as chocolate or vanilla
4640978 this gloriously simple ice cream cant be beaten all the complicated fancy ice creams out there the cookie cream confections and english toffees are just blown out of the water creamy rich pure sublime

4640984 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
4640985 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4640986 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
4640987 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4640988 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4640989 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
4640990 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4640991 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4640992 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4640993 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4640995 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4640996 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4640997 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4640998 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4640999 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4641000 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4641001 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4641002 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4641003 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find

4641129 sang dipa tinggal kenangan mp3 itu saya dapatkan dari seorang teman yang sempat menjadi lagu yang saya gemari hingga akhir 2007 dan belakangan ini saya sempat kaget kok lagu yang berdurasi singkat ini di bombastis oleh beberapa orang dengen menghadirkan misteri dibalik lagu ini
4641130 saya nggak tahu apa apa aneh saja ada cerita seperti itu
4641131 saya dikira sudah meninggal jadi banyak tetangga yang datang ke rumah melayat
4641132 obviously it depends on the industry and the business that youre in but usually during an economic downturn most businesses arent performing up to their potential
4641133 employees are more concerned about their future employment and their personal well being than they are about getting the job at hand done which can often lead to quality and production issues
4641134 once the strategy is shared you would hope that management and individual employees or contributors are able to engage and be part of the solution whether it means creating new products or services or different products that perform better during an economic downturn tightening belts managing expenses a little more carefully whatever it takes
4641135 the organization has to be careful not to damage relationships with their employees customers or shareholders or whoever the interested party is in an economic downturn because thats very hard to overcome afterwards
4641136 even though unemployment is up and the economy is struggling unemployment is at about 5 5 1 percent which is still extremely low
4641137 when it comes to unemployment of qualified talent its a lot lower we cant ignore that and we certainly dont to come out of this economic down turn in a situation where all of our strong talent is looking to leave because they didnt like the way we treated them during the downtime
4641138 baby boomers are still going to be retiring in larger numbers than what theyre doing today and the very near future well still have the same talent shortage during this economic downturn as we will after it

4641182 accounts from a handful of well respected scientists suggest that since the mid 1990s wireless companies have been doing their best to bury worrying findings discredit researchers who publish them and design experiments that virtually guarantee the desired results

4641191 but tim there were wmds what about sarrin what about yellowcake
4641192 we thought he had weapons of mass destruction turns out he didnt but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction
4641193 what did saddam have to do with the september 11th attacks
4641194 heres a story you may have missed over the long holiday weekend 550 metric tons of yellowcake uranium worth tens of millions of dollars were shipped out of iraq to canada the material was transported in 37 military flights in 3 500 secure barrels according to the associated press
4641195 in the mid 1980s i served as the intelligence officer for a marine artillery battalion stationed in twentynine palms calif i would often find myself deployed in the field on exercises where thousands of live artillery rounds were fired downrange
4641196 what makes this relevant now is the ongoing speculation about the source of the sarin chemical artillery shell that the us military found rigged as an improvised explosive device ied last week in baghdad
4641197 we have protocol for a reason it prevents common problems and allows us to focus on more specific difficult problems
4641198 what the fuck is a fogey now youre just making things up you crazy old person please dont post this i dont want people i know reading the word fogey that is so uncool
4641199 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4641200 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4641201 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4641202 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he opened the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4641203 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4641204 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4641205 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4641206 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4641207 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4641208 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4641209 i think the things that we produced absolutely brought soul to the forefront as evidenced by my having the cover of time magazine
4641210 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4641211 his voice sounded very strong and his laughter his spirit was great
4641212 behold i will display great wonders even in disaster i will come i shall clean purify heal deliver provide and lead my flock to me you are safe in my hands
4641213 i live in a high and holy place but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowlyand to revive the heart of the contrite
4641214 i will rescue those who love me i will protect those who trust in my name
4641215 there are many preaching lies in my name they shall have their due reward
4641216 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
4641217 and when you pray you shall not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets that they may be seen by men assuredly i say to you they have their reward
4641218 full of poppy beauty i thought death cab cum new order perhaps the playing was tight you could tell theyd put the time in at practice great fashion style and if you like the office dwight shrutes twin plays some mean drums
4641219 the problem between black men and black women is that she always wants to control things and doesnt know how to let a man be a man
4641220 the fucking dave clark five are in there thats like inducting candlebox
4641221 no neck he was so muscular that he had no neck
4641222 you who bring my word my good news to my kingdom go to the top speak of him proclaim god is here even for you
4641223 here is your god the lord comes with great power his arm rules for him
4641224 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
4641225 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
4641226 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4641227 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4641228 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4641229 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4641230 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4641231 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4641232 comfort the people tend to the lost the hurting the downtrodden the new new christians the backslidden those who do not yet have opened eyes
4641233 your hard service has been completed your sin has been paid for by christ on calvary your forgiveness is with me come and you shall be forgiven you have received double from the lord god double for your sins it is finished
4641234 most assuredly i say to you he who believes in me the works that i do he will do also and greater works than these he will do because i go to my father

4641237 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4641238 im going to ask them questions about character competence about values vision virtue about their convictions in leadership about their experience
4641239 and im going to deal with their personal life because character matters their personal life does matter as a leader god says so
4641240 i dont think either candidate will engender as much enthusiasm particularly among white evangelicals as george bush did
4641241 now that the republican party is a tarnished brand lots of people including evangelicals are looking for somewhere else to go
4641242 the democrats have to prove they would be a receptive and comfortable home for any evangelicals who want to move away from mccain and the republican party
4641243 i think initially the obama camp thought they would have a crack at a bigger slice of white evangelicals but in fact the latest numbers show a slightly worse position for obama than kerry had
4641244 i think the evangelical voter has been an important part of the republican constituency but its not a vote to be taken for granted
4641245 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4641246 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4641247 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4641248 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4641249 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4641250 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4641251 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4641252 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4641253 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4641254 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4641255 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4641256 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4641257 no wonder the pepper berries are missing from the wreath on our back door

4641259 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4641260 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4641261 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4641262 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4641263 we dont need three presidents and thats what you would have if hillary was picked barack hillary and bill
4641264 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4641265 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4641266 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4641267 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4641268 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4641269 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4641270 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4641271 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4641272 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4641273 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4641274 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4641275 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
4641276 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
4641277 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
4641278 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range
4641279 the basics needed to be an informed critical thinking citizen of our country
4641280 a lot of people base their opinions on the equivalent of urban legends stories that are so powerful that you assume they are incontrovertible but which may not actually be true
4641281 people are afraid of radioactivity because it is invisible and unknown
4641282 but that doesnt mean that we cant detect and work with it part of this wariness is that people dont trust the government when it says dont worry well they dont have to trust the government they can actually learn what levels of radioactivity are and what they cause and make their own judgment
4641283 is outside the purview of physics but policy should be based on facts and understanding
4641284 when i teach my class i say i dont care if you are pro or anti nuke youre going to learn about nukes
4641285 many who describe the report even members of the panel when speaking as individuals put spin on their description that is not in the report
4641286 in the end the issues go beyond physics but we need to recognize that many measures we institute in the united states to deal with global warming can be classified as feel good measures or setting the example measures
4641287 we have to ask ourselves which example the developing world will follow our example of reducing carbon emissions or our example of generating enormous wealth
4641288 just in asking the question he gave me a great compliment
4641289 science should be nonpartisan and thats how i try teach it
4641290 though ultimately just for one i just dont know which one
4641291 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4641292 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4641293 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4641294 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4641295 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4641296 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4641297 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4641298 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4641299 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4641300 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4641301 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4641302 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4641303 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4641304 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4641305 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4641306 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4641307 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4641308 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4641309 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4641310 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4641311 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4641312 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4641313 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4641314 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4641315 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4641316 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4641317 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4641318 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4641319 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4641320 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4641321 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4641322 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4641323 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4641324 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4641325 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4641326 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4641327 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4641328 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4641329 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4641330 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4641331 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4641332 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4641333 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4641334 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4641335 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4641336 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4641337 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4641338 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4641339 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4641340 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4641341 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4641342 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4641343 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4641344 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4641345 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4641346 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4641347 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4641348 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4641349 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4641350 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4641351 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4641352 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4641353 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4641354 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4641355 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4641356 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4641357 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
4641358 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
4641359 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
4641360 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
4641361 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4641362 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4641363 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4641364 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4641365 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4641366 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4641367 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4641368 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4641369 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4641370 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4641371 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4641372 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4641373 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4641374 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4641375 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4641376 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4641377 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4641378 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4641379 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4641380 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4641381 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4641382 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4641383 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4641384 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4641385 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4641386 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4641387 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4641388 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4641389 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4641390 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4641391 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4641392 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4641393 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4641394 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4641395 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4641396 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4641397 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4641398 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4641399 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4641400 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4641401 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4641402 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4641403 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4641404 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4641405 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4641406 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4641407 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4641408 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4641409 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4641410 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4641411 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4641412 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4641413 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4641414 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4641415 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4641416 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4641417 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4641418 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4641419 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4641420 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4641421 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4641422 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4641423 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4641424 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4641425 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4641426 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4641427 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4641428 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4641429 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4641430 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4641431 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4641432 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4641433 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4641434 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4641435 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4641436 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4641437 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4641438 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4641439 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4641440 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4641441 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4641442 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4641443 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4641444 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4641445 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4641446 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4641447 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4641448 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4641449 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4641450 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4641451 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4641452 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4641453 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4641454 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4641455 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4641456 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4641457 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4641458 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4641459 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4641460 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4641461 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4641462 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4641463 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4641464 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4641465 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4641466 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4641467 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4641468 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4641469 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4641470 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4641471 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4641472 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4641473 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4641474 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4641475 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4641476 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4641477 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4641478 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4641479 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4641480 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4641481 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4641482 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4641483 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4641484 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4641485 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4641486 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4641487 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4641488 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4641489 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4641490 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4641491 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4641492 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4641493 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4641494 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4641495 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4641496 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4641497 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4641498 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4641499 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4641500 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4641501 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4641502 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4641503 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4641504 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4641505 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4641506 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4641507 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4641508 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4641509 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4641510 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4641511 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4641512 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4641513 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4641514 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4641515 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4641516 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4641517 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4641518 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
4641519 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
4641520 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
4641521 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
4641522 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
4641523 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
4641524 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
4641525 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
4641526 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
4641527 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
4641528 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4641529 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4641530 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4641531 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4641532 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4641533 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4641534 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4641535 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4641536 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4641537 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4641538 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4641539 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4641540 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4641541 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4641542 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4641544 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4641545 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4641546 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4641547 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4641548 the best downloadable game to date on xbla and psn
4641549 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4641550 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4641551 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4641552 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4641553 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4641554 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4641555 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4641556 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4641557 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4641558 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4641559 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4641560 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4641561 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4641562 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
4641563 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4641564 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4641565 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4641566 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4641567 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4641568 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4641569 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4641570 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4641571 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4641572 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4641573 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4641574 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4641575 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4641576 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4641577 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4641578 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4641579 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
4641580 he cant practice so you go one everything you understood about him when you drafted him hes in every meeting he does all that but he doesnt get to rep it for a young guy they need to do that
4641581 they said no matter how good of shape you think youre in youre really going to find out what kind of shape youre in
4641582 they said when you cant run any more run some more now i know
4641583 he said just try to get it better and dont go until you know you can go
4641584 and take mental reps write stuff down knowing you cant be in the huddle just look from the sideline and ask a lot of questions
4641585 i dont know where i am on the depth chart right now
4641586 it really doesnt matter to me because im trying to get back out there to prove myself i feel like i havent even done anything yet
4641587 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4641588 weve lodged documents seeking declarations that he is in fact entitled to be adequately compensated and weve asked that the matter be referred to an associate judge for an audit to be done
4641589 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions its amazing where this series has been shown theres merchandising involved dvds so yes i think it could be millions
4641590 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4641591 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4641592 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4641593 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4641594 when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming

4641598 there is a bit of russian in all of us
4641599 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has russian roots
4641600 so any sort of situation or alien or creature or you know that can all be put down on the page where we could not have done it at the time with the technology available to us that was why the animated series had pluses even thought it was stories that were shorter in length simpler stories really basically one main plotline and maybe a possible small subplot but we could do anything because you could draw it
4641601 i think we always geared our stories to the human element
4641602 we were always telling stories for people to enjoy gene roddenberry always used to say if youre not writing for other human beings who are you writing for so we always kept that in mind but the fact is that for instance in the animated series and in the comic book you can go underwater to an underwater world and you can have all sorts of creatures and aliens in the animated series we had larry nivens kzinti the big cats and thats the sort of thing that could easily be done with drawings but not be as easily done with the technology we had
4641603 windows and some details in general seem sloppy please make sure in final product windows and details are straight and uniform
4641604 scribe lines on prototype in general are too wide thick and sometimes very sloppy make finer and thinner i can even see where the drill bit for the cnc machine slipped this is not acceptable
4641605 there is but i better not say there are certain things that as kids growing up whether its star trek or other shows at the time all you got to do is really just hear their voice and your heart warms
4641606 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything

4641620 oh sorry for stepping on your toe with my massive feet while wearing a backpack full of av gear
4641621 first weve got to narrow it down on who were going to work with in getting ready for louisville
4641622 saturday will be totally about evaluating where we are at each position and seeing whos ready to play and who needs some work then the following scrimmage well be going against some stuff we think louisville might be doing
4641623 but the major evaluation is going to happen saturday we have drills and all these different things going on and were working on fundamentals theyre a little leg weary so i dont expect it to be crisp as it would be if we had a lot of freshness in us but i want to see effort and i want to see execution
4641624 the offense has done some good things but its not consistent
4641625 thats something weve got to work toward the defense has done a lot of good things but im not sure if thats because the defense is really good or the offense is quite a ways behind
4641626 ive lost guys in shorts so you never know when an injury is going to happen so youre just hoping for the best and encouraging guys to keep their feet moving and stay out of piles
4641627 efficiency is doing things right effectiveness is doing the right thing
4641628 we recovered 18 bodies from the scene of the accident
4641629 we sent six seriously wounded people by helicopter to i dont know if any of them died
4641630 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4641631 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4641632 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read
4641633 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4641634 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4641635 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4641636 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4641637 georgian cities remain subject to the hostile and aggressive behavior of russia
4641638 are not in gori they have never been in gori they have never occupied gori
4641639 have begun providing relief supplies to tens of thousands of affected persons in those areas of the country that are accessible
4641640 however large parts of the conflict affected area particularly and the gori region remain for the most part inaccessible to humanitarian organizations due to ongoing insecurity lawlessness and other constraints
4641641 safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas

4641666 the lincoln mkt reinforces our commitment to further expand americas fastest growing luxury brand providing an all new vehicle to the showroom thats been crafted and honed for a new kind of customer
4641667 the mkt will offer the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a crossover and the performance of a sports sedan courtesy of its ecoboost engine
4641668 at the same time this perfect blend of performance and power is elegantly wrapped in the refined design cues that have become synonymous with modern lincolns
4641669 ecoboost engine technology is another symbol of what luxury means today
4641670 lincolns should drive as beautifully as they look delivering as much refinement on the road as their designs do even while standing perfectly still
4641671 embracing the same spirit as the concept the lincoln mkts design represents harmony in motion balancing sculptured shapes and contours traditionally associated with beautiful cars on a crossover vehicle that offers the luxury of space and efficient powerful performance

4641687 a princ pio percebi que os alunos estavam um pouco relutantes em participar do projeto principalmente pela id ia de terem suas vozes gravadas eles sabiam que em eu mostraria os trabalhos de uma classe para outra e estavam receosos das piadas e chacotas quanto as suas vozes e a qualidade de seus desenhos
4641688 iniciei a produ o de uma anima o em que eu faria todas as etapas elaborei a hist ria criei o roteiro fiz desenhos os pintei e gravei minha voz alterando a para caracterizar os personagens e a narra o ficou horr vel meu alunos quando viram riram muito e chegavam at a gargalhar eu humildemente admiti que n o tinha o talento deles e disse que eu precisaria da sua ajuda para produzir uma hist ria que fosse legal para exibirmos para os alunos da nossa escola com isso a desconfian a inicial foi superada e a primeira fase do projeto tomou forma

4641696 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4641697 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics

4641728 a princ pio percebi que os alunos estavam um pouco relutantes em participar do projeto principalmente pela id ia de terem suas vozes gravadas eles sabiam que em eu mostraria os trabalhos de uma classe para outra e estavam receosos das piadas e chacotas quanto as suas vozes e a qualidade de seus desenhos

4641730 o envolvimento dos alunos foi grande e a curiosidade em conhecer o produto final de suas classes e das outras agiu como um fator a mais de motiva o

4641734 the state needs to move forward albert must be released
4641735 the mandate for release had been issued and i still remained on death row though i had no more conviction
4641736 i myself had to petition the state district judge and demand the constitution be followed and i be removed from death row some lawyers wont fight for their clients and the client has to fight for themselves like i did
4641737 say you were arrested in 1993 and the statutes mandated that you serve 75 percent of your sentence say the statutes were changed and or new statutes created so that the law mandates inmates serve 85 percent of their sentence by the time your release parole date is near the statutes have been changed again and since you were convicted so long ago and have been incarcerated through several changes in legal statutes no one remembers how the original law worked

4641746 lamborghini needed a durable solution that protected the composite bodywork and components at the rear of the car
4641747 paint finishes were unable to meet the stringent quality and durability requirements set by lamborghini our coating is plasma sprayed in effect welding it to the base material making it more resilient during heat cycling life testing and abrasion tests together with the new black finish zircotec was able to deliver not only a highly durable coating but one that satisfied the requirements of lamborghinis styling department
4641748 the zircotec coating was the only coating that satisfied all our requirements
4641749 it is durable and offers significantly better performance than any other solution we have seen
4641750 up until now black was only available using high temperature paints
4641751 only using paint is less durable and is therefore not appropriate for oem applications we developed this finish as part of an increasing range of individual coatings that can be adjusted to the application and customer requirements it provides an extremely hard and durable surface that is highly resistant to vibration mechanical damage and thermal shock

4641763 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4641764 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today

4641770 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game

4641781 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
4641782 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
4641783 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama

4641797 they have different philosophies of leadership different philosophies of where government should be and should be headed and i thought you know what these guys will probably trust me to ask the questions that let them say who they really are
4641798 the leader who says im going to take my worldview and just put it on the shelf when i make decisions is either an idiot or theyre lying because you cant do it
4641799 all of your decisions are based on what you value what you believe in life and so i think its important to find out what these guys really believe

4641825 test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency and power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon
4641826 you will now see it in action the bomb which has no match in the world is being tested at a military site
4641827 the defense ministry stresses this military invention does not contradict a single international treaty russia is not unleashing a new arms race
4641828 the main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an incredibly high temperature
4641829 at the same time i want to stress that the action of this weapon does not contaminate the environment in contrast to a nuclear one
4641830 it the bomb will allow us to safeguard our states security and fight international terrorism in any circumstances and in any part of the world
4641831 this weapon does not contaminate the environment in contrast to a nuclear one
4641832 he could sing any song but if hes wise hell sing something in the style that bert sings

4641840 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4641841 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4641842 thats when it becomes a struggle out there at the moment they are either not milking or getting to sheds where families have got generators working
4641843 we want to be ready to act once that happens we intend to formalise our ideas and conduct some pre feasibility studies to at least indicate whether the projects would be commercially and practically viable
4641844 you cant make decisions on viability without having the land sorted out in the first place its exciting as its the first step in what we hope will be a significantly beneficial project for our region
4641845 the company has a reasonable capacity to raise funds at present we have no debt and we believe if its a good viable scheme funding it wont be a problem there will be a number of people happy to partner with us
4641846 were owned by local consumers its fair to say we believe it is the right thing for locals
4641847 the government has been strongly stressing the need for renewable energy the last winter has shown us we have a problem
4641848 we sort of see solar energy to be a little bit like where we saw fibre optic cable and broadband in 1998
4641849 the big advantage with solar energy is youre not nearly so restricted location wise the main requirement is to be close to a substation or transmission lines

4641879 its my favorite holiday of all the jewish holidays in that its the one that involves your home and your family and isnt about going somewhere else
4641880 a lot of it has to do with the daughters inability to talk about losing their father and the hurt that that creates in their lives

4641886 has a dramatic structure to it rise and climax and denouement
4641887 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4641888 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4641889 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
4641890 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
4641891 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf

4641906 every so often an investigation comes along that blows the lid off a particular industrys treatment of workers this is such an investigation
4641907 no matter what industry norms have been until now car washes need to clean up their act and stop paying sweatshop wages the labor department will take every step necessary to halt the illegal treatment of workers in the car wash industry
4641908 we are determined to change the culture in the car wash industry if we go back to a car wash and find that it is still flouting the law we will be referring cases for criminal enforcement
4641909 on this one youre on your own youve made your bed and now you lie in it bob told her that shes 19 now that she lives away from home and is old enough to learn from the decisions she makes he told her there would be massive flak from the newspapers but she just said it would be good for her career peaches said she knew what she was doing that marriage was a step towards stability she didnt miss out the chance to remind him that her and her mum had a rock and roll wedding in vegas the bottom line is that bob said he would be there to pick up the pieces if it all went wrong but all that has made peaches even more determined to make the marriage work

4641911 every month that goes by without tax reform america is a relatively less attractive place to do business over the past 18 months nine of the 30 most developed nations and 20 countries world wide from israel to germany to turkey have cut their corporate tax rates nations are slashing rates to attract capital and jobs from the u s and the tragedy is that our politicians keep making it easy for them

4641923 microsoft software has a lot of backdoors and security weaknesses that are always being patched so it is not secure we are also under us sanctions all this makes us think we need an alternative operating system
4641924 microsoft is a national security concern security in an operating system is an important issue and when it is on a computer in the government it is of even greater importance
4641925 linux is very promising students and universities are showing great enthusiasm but for older people it is difficult
4641926 it is not as easy as we thought we will have to get people used to changing over people are used to using microsoft so well need courses and seminars

4641936 oh a man in a dress how very silly isnt it
4641937 were looking at the shows from the eye of what would make a great three minute television performance which is sometimes not what people would perceive as the best number of the show
4641938 it must be something that holds together out of context of the show
4641939 theres a lot of compromise that goes into it and give and take
4641940 its a total collaboration no ones going in bullying anybody else we really talk through with their creative people and come to consensus on what we feel represents their show
4641941 usually we use two criteria what is the most energetic and robust number that a tv audience could watch that would make them want to buy tickets what is the largest number that could include the most people so that youre doing an ensemble number to show people that youre doing an old fashioned and heavily populated broadway musical
4641942 ive never had a situation where weve disagreed tv producers and theatre producers arrive at the same idea because clearly theres highlights of every show
4641943 we felt one of the songs played very well there so we decided to do that song again at the tonys and to expand it a little bit
4641944 our objective is to keep it interesting keep it exciting so that viewers have an interest in staying
4641945 that is one of many calculations that could go into the formula
4641946 much like in the music business what song plays first on an album what song plays second an album trying to create a flow that youre happy with
4641947 its more just creating something that feels like a natural flow like anything else in the art world thats subjective
4641948 these nominees are playing in that number so we cant put that award next to that number

4641956 as we know it to today it started with cameron mackintosh
4641957 with his productions of cats phantom and les miz its at that point where it really took off it really became a business and there was more than a cd and a brochure being offered
4641958 depending on the direction the show takes well start working with different graphics or well add lyrics that are in a song or text and we branch out but it starts with the logo
4641959 we had high hopes for a particular shirt and it didnt do as well and well pull that shirt and well put in another item and see how that goes
4641960 i just thought it wouldnt work at all and lo and behold it was terrific
4641961 legally blonde has the right audience legally blonde has a lot of repeat business it has the right fan base that is in the right demographic to like that idea its not something that would work at curtains
4641962 we didnt put no day but today on a t shirt until probably the second year and it was one of those a ha
4641963 when we did legally blonde we knew that oh my god was going on a shirt from day one
4641964 we decided that women wouldnt want their husbands to buy it we do have holy grail boxer shorts
4641965 but spamalot is unique in that the wide range of audience demographic leads to a wider assortment of top selling items
4641966 when this production opened it was an attempt and they succeeded in bringing in a younger audience
4641967 as much as we want to create an opportunity for your fashion line and the opportunity for people to buy many things first and foremost it is still a souvenir to take home of their experience on broadway
4641968 we need to have the grinch in a really cute characterization
4641969 by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes
4641970 i dont think i could go through the country girl script and come up with something like that
4641971 twilight zone is about mystery and theres no mystery here basically theyre going to pick you up and drop you
4641972 il ripristino di questo fondo frutto della nostra battaglia parlamentare che ci ha visto denunciare fin da subito la cancellazione del piano antiviolenza
4641973 even if the formula is a bit stale by now that doesnt make guitar hero aerosmith a bad game in fact if youre a huge fan of the band of the guitar hero franchise or havent yet seen what all of the fuss is over the music rhythm phenomenon this release will please and then some however if youve been following the franchise since the beginning youll probably wonder if this game is really necessary
4641974 aerosmith junkies will love guitar hero aerosmith thanks to its impressive song list and extra content everyone else however should rent it its a pleasant diversion providing single player and multiplayer enjoyment for would be strummers but with missing songs and the same old gameplay it doesnt have enough sweet emotion to justify its 59 99 price
4641975 soy un pecador no soy el mejor pero estoy del lado de los buenos
4641976 ac hubo gente grande que los extorsion a los chicos y lo voy a demostrar en el juicio
4641977 fue una trama mal hecha por periodistas que se fueron a fiscales me han mandado a juicio oral con nada de prueba con contradicciones con testimonios falsos dijo presentaron testigos falsos y hubo funcionarios judiciales que convalidaron este proceder estoy confiado de que empiece el juicio y pueda convencer a los jueces de toda esta causa armada
4641978 muchas veces a lo largo de estos a os anunciaba en los medios que ten a pruebas para desmentir todo y que quer a someterse a juicio pero cuando llegaba a los jueces la actitud era otra con maniobras dilatorias
4641979 habr que ver si grassi finalmente no pretende seguir poniendo trabas y aunque l diga lo opuesto est n probados los abusos las amenazas a testigos y el plan de la defensa para desmentir la consistencia de estas acusaciones hasta hubo funcionarios judiciales involucrados en esas maniobras que tambi n tendr que explicar sus actos ante la justicia
4641980 abuso deshonesto agravado y reiterado en concurso ideal con corrupci n de menores agravada sobre tres menores
4641981 unfortunately id be lying as the many punches civ rev pulls means its exhilaration is so often followed by slight dissatisfaction an 8 may not be enough to convince cynical minds to suck it and see which is a terrible shame this slick new civilization may be more reduction than revolution but its easily one of the most distinctive games on 360 and ps3
4641982 for new players it may be a stepping stone to true greatness fans of the older
4641983 you get john mccain in the white house and i do believe we will be at war with iran
4641984 its frightening to think of a man with his temperament with all the things a president has at his fingertips the irs cia fbi
4641985 were probably going to stay away from him if possible
4641986 well see how he is after a few days off
4641987 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4641988 its been a long summer with all the negotiations going on but im just happy we got the deal done finally
4641989 i really hope to do what i love to do most play baseball now its time for me to train myself and get ready for this fall
4641990 hes a very good addition to our organization this guy is a guy that we needed we had to wait it was worth it and its done i think we all should just be happy
4641991 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4641992 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4641993 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4641994 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4641995 this course you can make a lot of birdies but its quite easy to have a few bogeys in there too
4641996 i kind of knew at the beginning of the week i thought it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges 8 irons 9 irons into par 4s
4641997 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the

4642002 stale urine and suggested live aid supremo bob geldofs daughter peaches should be stamped on
4642003 god almighty i have respect for sir bob stamp on her though
4642004 noel gallagher was very clearly briefed in advance and monitored during the live interview
4642005 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air
4642006 i can talk to patients about medicinal cannabis and im often recommending it to them for these indications
4642007 het verschil met een zogenaamde streaming uitzending is de verspreidingsmethode die vaak plaats vindt via rss

4642009 1 day and i already got the phone back wow you saved the day
4642010 just a quick note to say you are a lifesaver cant believe how fast you shipped the iphone back
4642011 less than 2 days and my iphone is back and working perfect and feel free to use us as a reference
4642012 big thanks for all your help and getting the phone back so fast
4642013 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
4642014 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
4642015 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
4642016 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
4642017 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
4642018 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
4642019 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
4642020 like you we also want to improve to make a change

4642030 don king presents prizefighter is a flawed boxing game with excellent presentation and some features that should make the next fight night team stand up and take notice i stop short of calling it a solid effort because of the actual boxing gameplay but 2k definitely has something to build on in the future
4642031 the poorly constructed gameplay handcuffs the game from the word go and it never recovers its neither strategic or arcadey in nature and the animations are just plain ugly to watch boxing fans will just have to wait for the fourth addition to the fight night series in 2009 for another worthy addition to their boxing library
4642032 when a boxing game gets announced with in famous boxing promoter don king as the pitchman its hard not to take notice but if youre looking for the second coming of 3 10pm
4642033 u know that they gave this an average review because this site is microsoft loyal but they cant get it through their thick skulls that the ps3 is the better console with better more quality games ala mgs4

4642040 that adds up to 40 million pounds in the state of california
4642041 you could argue that this is just what people are needing that when they have this information theyll make all the right choices or you could argue that people already know theyre doing the wrong things but they do them anyway
4642042 diners are shocked at what theyre seeing and restaurants say theyre selling out of their lowest calorie choices when they never were before
4642043 longboarders are all weird all of the longboarders ive met are a little bit different
4642044 life is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre gonna get
4642045 maybe some people are wired to be more sexual and also to have better erections for a longer period of time
4642046 do as the spirit moves you and make decisions about sexuality that are comfortable for you and your partner
4642047 if we put it onto our calendar when we have to have sex i think we lose the positive effect of sex on health
4642048 this risk has been around for a long time and doctors know about it
4642049 medication guides go out with a prescription every time its refilled that makes sure patients see it
4642050 doctors will pay more attention to dear doctor letters if they just come out on occasion so they sort of imply oh my god this is something terrible
4642051 it could make people so afraid of using the drug that patients who should be treated wouldnt be treated
4642052 the effects were not as large as some psychiatrists especially child psychiatrists had feared
4642053 the important question concerning the trade offs between unnecessarily exposing a child to a small increased risk of suicidality and the risk of doing nothing for a child impaired by depression
4642054 it is not part of the information thats routinely handed out to patients
4642055 when we think a warning is particularly important and requires special attention for safe use of a drug we put a box around the warning to highlight it so it can be seen better
4642056 this is generally given when the fda has half a mind to take the drug off the market but doesnt want to because of the good it does for some patients
4642057 its used when a drug has a very rare but very serious effect if it has a very serious but common effect the drug is withdrawn
4642058 we require medication guides when we feel its particularly important for consumers to understand a serious risk in weighing decisions about taking the drug
4642059 then you dont really need a medication guide you need a good doctor
4642060 ive been realizing more and more lately that jesus just wants us to give to people any people that he never attached agendas or hidden reasons for reaching out to others
4642061 i think we should just give no strings attached and maybe someday our giving will lead them to a deeper spiritual truth

4642071 agradezco el acogimiento y el recibimiento de todo el pueblo paraguayo la verdad ha sido muy emotivo y muy c lido
4642072 se ha producido un fen meno impresionante lo importante es que es una etapa fundacional

4642078 es importante que vuestro presidente deje en claro un dato el cambio no es una cuesti n electoral el cambio en paraguay es una apuesta cultural quiz s la m s importante en su historia por lo tanto no se trata de un proceso que tiene vencedores ni vencidos ni propietarios exclusivos este cambio es la oportunidad que tenemos unos y otros en nuestra querida naci n para asumir la copropiedad del proceso que no requiere otra cosa que intenci n de producir aportes desde la gesti n que ejerci ramos para sostenerlo lo cual es la propia cancelaci n de la interminable transici n y nuestra incorporaci n plena al universo de democracias consolidadas del mundo

4642089 they were ordering some for everybody we even laser engraved brooms because they swept the tonys somebody brought in actual brooms and we laser engraved all the names in the handles
4642090 it would be nice that they could walk it around and share it with their friends and family and cast and crew

4642096 da donna da mamma e da sportiva che conosce e rispetta i sani principi della competizione agonistica non posso che restare sorpresa delusa esterrefatta nel rileggere le motivazioni per le quali sono stata allontanata
4642097 in questi anni prosegue giusi in acqua o a bordo vasca sono stata orgogliosa di portare in alto non solo la pallanuoto ma anche il nome della mia citt tanto orgogliosa che ho sacrificato anche tutti i mesi della mia gravidanza fino al momento del parto non vi dico cosa provo da donna nascondere i propri pensieri reali dietro un evento per me e per i miei amici veri lietissimo come la nascita di mio figlio diego una vigliaccheria non si pu costruire un castello solido sulla sabbia ai dirigenti dico soltanto una cosa ai vostri figli spero diate un esempio diverso certamente pi educativo di quello che ho ricevuto io
4642098 mentre la tua compagna adesso tutta coito e curve non detto che tra cinque o dieci anni le cose stiano ancora cos e che riuscir ancora ad attizzarti dalla cintola in gi e se al contrario si riveler perfida e malvagia pi di quanto tu avresti potuto supporre
4642099 perch mai non dovresti toglierti un capriccio ogni tanto lobbiettivo sempre quello portartela a letto occorre saperci fare per dopo potrai archiviare lavventura tra i tuoi bei ricordi
4642100 avere rapporti sessuali durante le mestruazioni una questione di scelta molto dipende dalla coppia o semplicemente dai gusti di lui e di lei tuttavia ahi noi la natura ha fatto in modo che durante le mestruazioni le donne non abbiano un grande desidereio sessuale e comunque ricorda se in quei giorni non lo fai tu ci pensa qualcun altro
4642101 mentre la tua compagna adesso tutta coito e curve non detto che tra cinque o dieci anni le cose stiano ancora cos e che riuscir ancora ad attizzarti dalla cintola in gi e se al contrario si riveler perfida e malvagia pi di quanto tu avresti potuto supporre

4642105 if youre looking for a game you can play with friends and family one that everybody will be able to pick up and enjoy in a matter of minutes look no further than ea boom blox its a fun puzzler and also a game that really puts nintendos controller to great use
4642106 its a casual game made for a casual crowd but its far and away the best one ive ever played
4642107 the bourne conspiracy which is loosely based on the events of the first movie doesnt suck in fact its pretty good sure its not a true blockbuster but its not total garbage either
4642108 a trifle repetitive and brief the bourne conspiracy is a diamond in the rough well worth a look but its not going to change your life however therere two more films worth of material to adapt so maybe future bourne adventures will give a little more control to the player and a little less to the button pressing mini game
4642109 maybe future bourne adventures will give a little more control to the player and a little less to the button pressing mini game
4642110 travellers tales has once again delivered an experience that boils down to smashing stuff over and over again while searching for secrets while also managing to make that formula fun and addictive its certainly not a huge leap over the lego star wars titles and in fact still has some of that series issues but its no less enthralling and certainly a fun adventure worth taking on
4642111 lego indys main quest isnt terribly expansive you can finish it in a weekend and thats if you take your time but the games unquestionably built for completists with a ton of hidden treasure and extra characters you can unlock pretty much every character in the films right down to last crusade s castle butler its easy to dismiss as kids fare but lego indiana jones is a light enjoyable action game especially if youve got a willing friend for co op play
4642112 this is all starting to sound a bit grinchy so at this point i feel i should point out that my five year old son who helped me with the hands on preview is currently at 99 7 percent completion on our second save game with just one character left to unlock hes certainly commented on the absence of familiar features and seems less enthused about collecting billions of lego studs now that theres not as much to spend them on but hes still been happily replaying his favourite levels over and over just as he did with star wars
4642113 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4642114 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states
4642115 i guess id hoped an exercise videogame would make fitness a lot more fun and easier to do and though it doesnt quite exceed those expectations wii fit will get you moving especially if youre looking for a gentle fun introduction to an exercise program
4642116 you can compare your results with others but really its about setting your own targets and seeing how your performance improves so far ive found this provides enough motivation to play wii fit every day sometimes for ten minutes sometimes for an hour i dont know how long ill keep this up for but i do know switching on the wii is a lot easier than going to the gym wii fit is not as beneficial undoubtedly but a lot more fun
4642117 but for a title that is so geared toward the everyman it clings onto one hardcore fundamental unlocking challenges so if youre the type who wants to jump right into everything that wii fit has to offer from the beginning youre out of luck youll need to spend days upon days partaking in all of the modes to earn wii fit minutes which eventually add up and open up other portions of the experience
4642118 how do you rate something that isnt really a game
4642119 no objectives per se no levels no sense of accomplishment in the traditional gaming sense beating a hard boss level
4642120 that describes wii sports pretty accurately too did anybody have difficulty reviewing wii sports
4642121 i dont hate the wii so much as the casuals who buy them fuck them theyre part of the problem
4642122 good so you agree that the wii shouldnt even be put in the same category as ps3 or 360 right
4642123 no tehy shoodnt be allowed to play gamez becuz the gamez tehy like all suck fuck them
4642124 good so you agree that the wii shouldnt even be put in the same category as ps3 or 360 right kthxbai
4642125 the difference here is that the wii and nintendos strategy really do undermine what games are striving to be in a few years time people will look back on the wii like they look back on boy bands just like boy bands are percived as fake rip off assembled music the wii will be seen as the same
4642126 oh my god the wii is worthless cuz it doesnt look as good as my system
4642127 if it doesnt have a lot of blood and violence its a little kid game
4642128 my system is better cuz i get to play with annoying 14 year olds online who dont know how to shut the fuck up
4642129 waa waa waa my system isnt selling as well and i dont know why
4642130 ninja gaiden ii isnt perfect but its an incredible attempt lame english dialogue a somewhat limp story and awkward camera angles arent nearly enough to derail the splendid gameplay and eye popping visuals
4642131 even with a technical hiccup here or there ninja gaiden ii is a sight to behold and a great deal of fun to master and yet the game doesnt feel as special as ninja gaiden did lets face it ninja gaiden black left us a bit spoiled as far as the complete package goes in terms of straight action and stylish deep gameplay ninja gaiden ii succeeds on nearly every front what it lacks is the fat that extra something on the meat to give it flavor
4642132 how can you knock a game for being too hard
4642133 anything over a 9 for this is kinda overrating it
4642134 although quake wars on pc had a long development it still looked great when pc gamers finally got hold of it last year on xbox 360 this look has been ported overly pretty much intact and although not top of its class quake wars still looks like it fits on microsofts console on ps3 its a different story altogether the game is simply less attractive with fewer effects rougher edges and a less consistent frame rate although minor visual differences between console games are normal here theres a pretty big gap with the xbox 360 game 80 100 having a level of polish that the ps3 version 70 100 is sorely missing ps3 owners even have to sit through an eight minute install before they can begin playing and this doesnt seem to help the game load any faster than the 360 version
4642135 what was really weird is we were given the debug code for the 360 and the full retail copy for the ps3 but the shuttering occurred far more often on the ps3 than it did on the 360 the biggest differences between the ps3 66 100 and xbox 360 76 100 versions are found in the menu interface and online matching both versions are well organized but ill have to give the nod to the 360 once again as the 360 versions interface is far more accessible i did like being able to choose from a list of available matches on the ps3 though another big difference between versions is the quality of the voice chat the ps3 produces some terrible echoes and painfully distorted feedback

4642142 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4642143 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4642144 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4642145 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4642146 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4642147 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4642148 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day
4642149 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4642150 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4642151 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read
4642152 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4642153 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4642154 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4642155 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4642156 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4642157 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4642158 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4642159 from chun li thanks for being there through a difficult time
4642160 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4642161 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4642162 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4642163 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4642164 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4642165 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4642166 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog
4642167 and the star gave them 1 000 and instructions to make someones life better young used to money to seek donations from others eventually raising more than 35 000 for needy families in
4642168 we all have our ups and we all have our downs and when youre up you reach out and when youre down you allow others to help
4642169 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
4642170 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4642171 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4642172 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4642173 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4642174 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4642175 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4642176 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4642177 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4642178 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4642179 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4642180 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4642181 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4642182 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4642183 a is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4642184 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4642185 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
4642186 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
4642187 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
4642188 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4642189 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4642190 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4642191 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4642192 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4642193 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4642194 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4642195 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4642196 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4642197 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4642198 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4642199 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4642200 that east west has done so much stephen sondheim that you never do
4642201 pippin is obviously a contemporary story grafted onto a historical milieu and when done successfully sort of both things are happening at once
4642202 its not so specifically set in a place and a time that you cant fool around with it
4642203 a lot of the younger audiences the younger performers dont want to be defined by race anymore theyre not necessarily asian anymore or african american or latino
4642204 bob fosses choreography is very sexy it deals with a lot of isolation of body parts lots of shoulders lots of hips lots of knees and all that i see that correlation in hip hop
4642205 we thought that everything that we do onstage has to be dead serious as if its life or death
4642206 i have to kind of squash it down a bit
4642207 you get songs like magic to do where the melody line is so not hip hop
4642208 if anything theres a sort of a pop element to it
4642209 variations on japanese woodblock prints with a kicked up anime color scheme
4642210 the simplest answer is that my job is to be the liaison between the music department and the dance department
4642211 the person who takes both the melodic and the musical structure of the show and what the choreographer wants to do physically and tries to marry them
4642212 every time a character does something its accompanied by an appropriate sound
4642213 if you have emotional music with an emotional scene it can get sappy
4642214 its like focusing a light on an actors face im using the music to tell the audience where to look at the dance
4642215 rob ashford and kathleen marshall both like making abc lists the a numbers are the ones that really involve dance and specific dance movements the b list is the one that involves essentially musical staging the cs are the numbers that they dont really need to think about except for shaping in a very general sense like a ballad something that isnt movement driven
4642216 knew it would have a chase sequence he knew that within the number there would be moments when the guys break out of prison where can we expand the number
4642217 we say heres a place we can expand it then how do we want to expand it is it just its own section which means youre establishing something that has its own melody
4642218 or were going to only add a couple of eights here
4642219 hell come back and say i wish i had four more counts here and ill say can you do that for one more bar
4642220 this is what i hear this is whats important heres where its loud heres where its really supporting the dance heres where you can go a slightly different way
4642221 i might say gosh thats a bigger accent than i thought or thats a bigger gesture than i thought
4642222 on the script it says bambi does an incredible dance that wows everyone
4642223 that character has to prove that shes truly talented and not just there because of her mother
4642224 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4642225 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4642226 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward
4642227 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4642228 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4642229 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4642230 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment
4642231 rather than spend millions in advertising we thought we would give you 10 of free service so you could try it out for yourself
4642232 love is not a habit a commitment or a debt it isnt what romantic songs tell us it is love simply is
4642233 when youre carving down a garage it feels the same as a snowboard its just scarier because its concrete even packed snow is a lot nicer to fall on
4642234 but when youre carving down a gentle hill it reminds me of snowboarding so much its really calming for me
4642235 every time skateboarding becomes incredibly focused on one type of skating whether its vert skate parks or street skating its myopia is its demise because this focus drowns out whatever else is happening
4642236 then you have the casual dad who walks in here with junior to get him his tony hawk board
4642237 and while were putting juniors board together the dad sees all these longboards asks to look at one then theyre standing on it and the next thing you know the glaze has come over their eyes and he ends up walking out with a nice 45 inch pintail and his kid will have his typical little flippie board
4642238 the body movements are virtually identical to snowboarding and the awareness and being able to look around you and make those movements when you have to is important
4642239 it helps overall coordination and helps keep you in shape
4642240 its so comfortable to go places if its within a mile or two or maybe even three
4642241 its so much easier to just get on the board and start rolling down the sidewalk its a lot easier than firing up the beast driving and having to look for parking
4642242 ele as abordava na rua com o intuito de roubar simulando estar armado as conduzia para um lugar escuro embaixo do elevado pr ximo pra a roosevelt onde cometia a viol ncia sexual

4642244 talks had been dead for a couple of weeks they made a ballpark range of a set offer on a set number and i was set to go to school i was very excited for school with all of my stuff all ready to go yesterday they called and things picked up from there out of nowhere they said that they had the money it was one of the hardest decisions i have had to make and they gave me an offer i could not turn down
4642245 once i am done playing baseball they will pay for my college it was a big deal we wanted to make sure that was part of the package
4642246 i made it known from the beginning that i was set for going to school miller said i am sure that did help some with the negotiations because i really was not budging i was up front with coach fox and forbes about what it would take to sign me pittsburgh made some offers before that and i turned them down because i was going to school in the end they came up with the money and i had to take it
4642247 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
4642248 just as sure as every texan goes to church on sunday every texan needs a great deal on a ford f 150
4642249 and when im done with this commercial ima go kill me the bandino family across the street for sucking up all the juice
4642250 i am very optimistic that ftc has obtained critical support of key community leaders as a result of our meetings this week
4642251 we left every meeting feeling that we could count on these individuals and groups to help us in any way they could to continue to get our case out to the public
4642252 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4642253 esencial que eeuu y otros pa ses libres garanticen que una democracia asediada permanezca soberana segura y unida
4642254 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4642255 para comenzar a reparar las relaciones con eeuu europa y otras naciones y para comenzar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo rusia debe actuar y poner fin a esta crisis
4642256 there so much more to appreciate about this game its dynamic mission structuring remarkable sound design wealth of side content amazing animation the list goes on and on long story short i never thought i would see this much content in a game grand theft auto iv doesnt just raise the bar for the storied franchise it completely changes the landscape of gaming once you play it you wont look at video games the same way again
4642257 finally the wait for a true gta multiplayer experience was well worth it and the online game modes mostly variations on deathmatches car races car races and self contained co op missions add a lot of value to an already jam packed game multiplayer is not as integral part of the game as it was to say halo 3 or call of duty 4 but the ability to play over the entire city map is brilliant online matches are accessed right from the game via the call phone and well have a more in depth take on the games multiplayer offerings once the game is released and the servers are fully populated
4642258 gta iv is the 10 10 you were expecting almost everything you do in liberty city would be good enough to drive its own game and the best parts would be good enough to outrun the competition but the reason it works so well is that rockstar has made a game that requires no patience to play this as much as its usual coherency and the best script in the series is what makes gta iv the best openworld game yet and why it will take something miraculous to rob it of game of the year status
4642259 to be totally honest it would be very easy to write another 2000 odd words on this game as we havent even delved into the hours of television you can watch the amazingly detailed virtual internet the strip clubs that you can visit the ultra realistic vehicle physics and so on
4642260 the 360 has richer colors but the ps3 has better anti aliasing making it look a little cleaner
4642261 every player is going to have their own love hate relationship with
4642262 generally video game franchises move forward with each successive release in this case mario kart for the wii has taken a few steps forward and one huge step back this is the first case of nintendo not finding a happy medium between accessibility and servicing hardcore players yet if you get a group of people together on a saturday night to play youll be the only one complaining while the competitive spirit may be quelled theres no denying that the foundation here is solid and the addition of bikes tricks and online play are all positives that no one can deny
4642263 i think i will be playing more mario kart than gt
4642264 if youre wanting speed maybe a kart racer isnt for you
4642265 it would appear i would need to pick up a couple of wavebirds to enjoy this game
4642266 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4642267 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4642268 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4642269 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4642270 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4642271 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4642272 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4642273 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4642274 you get john mccain in the white house and i do believe we will be at war with iran
4642275 its frightening to think of a man with his temperament with all the things a president has at his fingertips the irs cia fbi

4642297 it will be nice to be out there and play a little bit and see if we can make improvements from last week
4642298 from the fighting mechanics to roster of players brawl is a well rounded game that i just couldnt put down the only downside to brawl is that it doesnt do anything to reinvent the series it takes elements of past ssb games and refines them which is great but players expecting an entirely new experience wont find it here still it is a well round game that doesnt disappoint and its a must buy for every wii owner
4642299 you will play the game to death when you get it but unlike so many single player hits metroid and mario included you will still be playing and consequently loving brawl in the months and years to come it is one of the great multiplayer titles of the generation and simply not to be missed
4642300 thats the beauty of brawl its a game that keeps on giving the game supports online matchups via the wi fi connection of course but even when youre not focused on the primary game modes you can spend hours just playing with extra features or hunting down a ton of unlockables
4642301 were pretty sure the many who plan on playing all sunday night and are calling in sick for monday dont care
4642302 these technologies had the unfortunate characteristic of being best suited for production at or near the point of energy consumption
4642303 larrym of course you are right and as much as i respect daniel its fairly obtuse to suggest otherwise mccain really is a senile probably madman certa
4642304 this is going to be the kind of place i think families will want to stop in and grab great food listen to wonderful music and enjoy the beautiful park that the city of boston and massport has worked so hard to develop i hope this will not only be an addition to the waterfront but a welcome mat to other businesses to join us and truly develop this area into one of bostons best new areas
4642305 hes got a fractured spine well not a fractured spine i said that wrong he has a hairline fracture so hes out for the year
4642306 he never really got going he went out and tried it one or two or three days and then couldnt practice anymore he had a series of tests done that came back yesterday
4642307 i dont know that they are going to recheck him in three months or something its gotta heal once it heals i would think i would hope i dunno
4642308 umm well let me start off by saying i love tomatoes and grow several types of heirloom tomatoes in my back yard blah blah blah blah blah
4642309 sweet thats the tomatoes or mangoes or anything else that is sweet salty is the salt tart is the lime juice or any other tart or sour component hot can be jalapenos savory cumin herbal cilantro or parsley or some other herb see what im getting at here
4642310 first off will you share what the o c in your name stands for

4642314 what is your all time favorite food and or dish
4642315 macaroni and cheese kraft original but i love a simple grilled steak with evoo and lemon juice
4642316 a more advanced version lobster mac and cheese not kraft
4642317 ill try anything once ive tried putrefied shark in iceland once was enough
4642318 is there anything you have never eaten that you would like to try
4642319 is there anything you wish you could cook better or any new techniques you would like to learn
4642320 not really if i want to learn something i do i am always trying to learn more
4642321 aside from your own what is your current favorite restaurant in boston
4642322 taberna de haro or is it haro de taberna it rocks but no body talks about it
4642323 lastly what is one thing that no one knows about you

4642335 the moons shadow also a signal blind area could cause a power shortage in freezing temperatures
4642336 i thought to myself well i really dont have a choice about whether i should do this play or not
4642337 most actors are nervous theyre timid they find their way sideways into the role they find every reason not to actually do the scene theyd rather talk about it for a hundred years
4642338 he was never mentioned in any classroom i had been in and i learned a great deal
4642339 my only real knowledge of him was that he was the first black man appointed to the united states supreme court
4642340 i thought that this would be an opportunity for me to educate people
4642341 i hope to be able to play it with a kind of energy that he would have had at that time
4642342 i dont have a process that i learned in an acting class whereby i break a script down or whereby i do a certain kind of research
4642343 the voice he spoke to his wife with would have been very different from the voice he would have used when he was arguing brown
4642344 kind of 50 50 between people ive worked with and people who have only seen my work
4642345 there are shows that are realistic types of lighting like sunrises and sunsets and candlelight thats not me i just dont have the patience to re create all that i like abstracted space and i like event type of shows heavier on the event than the realistic storytelling
4642346 thats typical of a commercial production because people will open the purse strings slowly
4642347 the last few years ive been hired before the set designer
4642348 trying to respond to the show emotionally and with that emotional response think of how you can contribute to it personally
4642349 lighting should be warm and inviting and we should kind of want to be in the room with the performers that really has as lot to do with the color having a warmer color a softness to it
4642350 people are all lighting designers when they turn off the fluorescent lights in the kitchen and put the candles on the table theyre designing the lighting in the room to make it feel a certain way
4642351 i often work from background to foreground laying in layers of light
4642352 at times the staging was very tight just on a bench and at times it covered a 25 foot wide space so to make a look that could cover both of those was hard
4642353 which i found very difficult to do when i first stated this you dont really know what the staging is you put in room to wiggle around
4642354 sometimes very little changes and sometimes a lot changes and a lot is like 30 percent
4642355 transition from scene to scene do they black out quickly or do they cross fade from one part of the stage to another like in a musical segue or is the curtain coming down and youre taking all the light off the stage
4642356 there are times when the lighting is part of the spectacle and should be very muscular i call it should be doing a lot of the work but there are times that l should sit back and let other elements push the storytelling along a show can be all of one or all of the other or be combinations of those things
4642357 in the book parts of the show the lighting sits back and when you go into the songs the lighting gets a little more muscular
4642358 someones murdered red light after you do that a bunch of times when youre 25 you dont do that any more
4642359 in january i was working on three different shows and i was in three different theatres some days
4642360 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4642361 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4642362 mr campfield could you give me a ride to the garage to pick up my car
4642363 no my mom lives here too my dad died several years ago

4642365 i dont know what the attraction is but i think you are handsome in a dignified way and wanted to pursue it should we
4642366 this will surely do not that long but plenty thick
4642367 i thought youd be good with your mouth ive always heard that white guys are good pussyeaters thats true most brothers dont care about pleasing us they are selfish you werent selfish with your tongue
4642368 i hope you dont think this is too strange but he wont eat me and i want to know how it feels
4642369 you sure do your boyfriend doesnt know what hes missing
4642370 as has been previously pointed out theres a lot of audi tt in the roofline

4642372 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4642373 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4642374 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4642375 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4642376 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4642377 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4642378 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4642379 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4642380 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4642381 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4642382 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4642383 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4642384 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4642385 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4642386 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4642387 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4642390 im surprised youve stayed at your job as long as you have
4642391 this was the worst attack in many years and is a major escalation of hostilities
4642392 this appears to be the beginning of a new approach
4642393 to surround kabul and eliminate any foreign or government presence in the area
4642394 the taliban know that they can gain a lot from high profile attacks against the aid organizations and other noncombatants
4642395 a simple ambush like this gets the whole world talking more than any drawn out military battle with coalition forces
4642396 aid agencies have an important role in strengthening the afghan state and improving its public image but without such agencies the government becomes very weak unable to provide basic services for its people a situation that the taliban will exploit readily
4642397 i think things are going to only get worse especially with the 2009 afghan presidential elections coming up
4642398 in order for us to operate the local communities must guarantee our safety
4642399 a statistic that has clearly worsened over the course of 2008
4642400 recent news reports provide further evidence to back up the findings
4642401 is proof of the talibans resurgence in and around the capital as well as in their southern and eastern heartlands

4642404 mining and construction sectors are hoovering up workers raising the risk that this strong labour demand boosts earnings across a raft of other industries
4642405 but there are no signs of that happening at least not yet the key reason has been soaring migration levels ensuring that labour supply and demand are being kept in reasonable balance
4642406 this incident is a clear indicator of the need to amend current pa law and give qualified veterinarians sole authority to humanely euthanize animals in medical or behavioral circumstances as they see fit
4642407 i was digging around in the attic and i found all my grandmas old clothes from when she was a flapper in the twenties i thought my boyfriend would like it if i dressed up for him in costume i like to try new things so i dont get bored i thought maybe we could role play or something like i could be a cabaret dancer who wants a part in a show and my boyfriend is the director who says i can be the star as long as i fuck him hell have to make me the star of the show once i suck the first load out of his dick with my mouth and then squeeze the second one out with my cunny
4642408 i tend to get tired of doing the same old things during sex especially now that its summer break im home all day and theres not much else to do but fuck the hours away my boyfriend likes it though he says hes never been with a girl as freaky as me im all about trying new positions and toys and acting out our most secret fantasies
4642409 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4642410 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4642411 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4642412 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4642413 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4642414 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4642415 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4642416 who are open to doing something on the production side
4642417 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4642418 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4642419 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4642420 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4642421 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4642422 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4642423 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4642424 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4642425 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4642426 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4642427 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4642428 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4642429 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4642430 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4642431 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4642432 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4642433 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4642434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4642435 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4642436 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4642437 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4642438 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4642439 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4642440 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4642441 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4642442 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4642447 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4642448 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4642449 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4642450 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4642451 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4642452 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4642453 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4642456 its a field of the best 1500 swimmers youd ever want to see
4642457 never before has there been a final where everyones had to go under 15 minutes
4642458 so its not just going to be whos the fastest swimmer its who can be the fastest swimmer twice and thats going to be the real killer
4642459 about the time that you thought it was going to be right on the car it was gone
4642460 its fairly well known already we just need to make it easy and pleasant for people out there
4642461 if i had not seen it with my own two eyes i would not believe it
4642462 its more of a phenomenon i never felt the creepy feeling on sarah jane road that i felt there
4642463 it looks as if the truck is moving forward and the road is stretching out real long in front of the truck
4642464 it looks as if the truck is moving backwards and the road is stretching out real long
4642465 we wanted it to sound like the way they would have recorded it in 1928
4642466 you could spend one day just recording one vocal track and putting down layers and layers of guitar overdubs you could spend a whole day setting up drum sounds getting the drums exactly how you want them
4642467 theyre used to going in and laying the tracks down and spending a lot of time on the vocals spending a lot of time on really making a record the way that you would make a rock record
4642468 it would be cost prohibitive for us to make a record like that with passing strange
4642469 half of the energy is the audience reaction and how stew plays off of the audience so the audience is almost like another character in the show
4642470 its usually scheduled very very specifically down to the minute
4642471 they dont seem to know anything about business but they sell books which i love
4642472 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4642473 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4642474 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4642475 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4642476 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4642477 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4642478 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4642479 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4642480 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4642481 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4642482 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4642483 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4642484 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4642485 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4642486 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4642487 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4642488 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4642489 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4642490 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4642491 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4642492 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4642493 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4642494 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4642495 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4642496 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4642497 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4642498 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4642499 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4642500 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4642501 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4642502 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4642503 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4642504 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4642505 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4642506 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4642507 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4642508 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4642509 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4642510 from filigree to hammered pieces this designer knows how to add delicacy to
4642511 very likely we are at the maximum of world oil production

4642518 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4642519 weve lodged documents seeking declarations that he is in fact entitled to be adequately compensated and weve asked that the matter be referred to an associate judge for an audit to be done
4642520 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions its amazing where this series has been shown theres merchandising involved dvds so yes i think it could be millions
4642521 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4642522 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4642523 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4642524 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4642525 when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming
4642526 i could tell you but then id have to kill you

4642530 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4642531 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4642532 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4642533 on the day of judgment we shall set up scales of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed we will bring it to account and sufficient are we to settle the accounts

4642536 yes we are betting that by age 21 miley cyrus will be a full fledged slut
4642537 i am not a slut yet it will take me a long time to catch up with lindsay and paris so give me a break im trying arent i
4642538 i tried a silent but deadly but i guess i didnt have enough pucker control and it roared out
4642539 i detected at the end of the trumpet that miley unknowingly added a portion of a wet fart to her final round of trumpeting im sure she had some discomfort for the remainder of the show
4642540 i plan on eating some broccoli a pound of beans and some cornbread an hour or two before the show theyll get mileys attention
4642541 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions

4642567 i find it impo ssible to give expression to the feelings that overpowered me when i heard of the surprise you had prepared for me my first impulse was not to accept any gift or otherwise to devote it to some or other public end but after having read and reread your letter i have decided to accept your gift in the same simple and loving spirit in which it was sent to me

4642570 were very demanding on our voices we have a tendency to work hard we have a tendency to play hard
4642571 a strained whisper like this actually causes more friction on the vocal folds

4642582 los beneficios en salud no pueden ser ilimitados deben tener un punto de partida
4642583 el modelo de atenci n actual basado en el aseguramiento de riesgos no es viable si no se profundiza en la atenci n integral y oportuna tenemos que conseguir que todos los ciudadanos tengan acceso a los servicios de salud con oportunidad calidad y en igualdad de condiciones
4642584 tendr n calidad de no contribuyente de impuestos nacionales as como del impuesto de industria y comercio en relaci n con las actividades propias de su objeto social

4642606 antes de irme nueva york ten a una vida tranquila sin mayores eventos que un paso lineal pero en el momento en el que estaba en el escenario en la audici n siendo segismundo y luego anatol sent que vivir ten a sentido
4642607 y nada mejor que ganarse la vida haciendo lo que a uno m s le gusta el proceso de cambio no es f cil porque uno siempre tiene que luchar contra sus fantasmas sus obsesiones su familia
4642608 sin embargo creo que toma un instante decidirse y de nuevo muchos d as y muchas noches adaptarse a la idea de una nueva vida con todas sus implicaciones
4642609 theyve put them in jail theyve done their jobs theyve brought it to the courts and yet this person is still out on the street

4642611 hopefully hell be looking at quite a bit of time
4642612 the use of blame is out the window it serves no purpose whatsoever we work together on a daily basis to try and bring these people to justice
4642613 would have to include oddly parallel accounts of both a the great expanding confidence and influence of modern science and technology and b the coincident ever growing pessimism that all of that and much of anything else matters all that much
4642614 conseguir trabajadores para los proyectos es dif cil muchos de ellos desertan o pasan de obra en obra tras la mejor oferta de sueldo

4642622 inicialmente no se pide nada m s porque la mayor a de veces cuando alguien necesita ayuda tiene temor de expresar sus sentimientos y de que sean evaluados por alguien pero durante la conversaci n la gente se puede dar cuenta de que esta es una herramienta seria para brindar ayuda
4642623 intentamos que el paciente exprese lo que siente y tratamos de tranquilizarlo y de darle seguridad
4642624 cuando asistimos a la consulta cara a cara tenemos el recurso de la observaci n para evaluar al paciente nos ense aron que ese era el m todo pero con la tecnolog a es distinto con la ventaja de que este no se siente observado ni juzgado y se expresa con m s libertad
4642625 todo depende del problema pues van desde un episodio de depresi n hasta trastornos de personalidad como el de ansiedad dependencias adicciones narcisismo o duelo patol gico entre otros
4642626 por ese medio se pierde informaci n y no se puede analizar lo que el paciente hace en su conducta no verbal ni si est mintiendo o no
4642627 son el resultado de ese impulso inicial de recrear los espacios en los cuales he estado perdido
4642628 estos acuden a remates de inmuebles desalojados y los venden a menor precio
4642629 es vital que la defensor a acompa e los operativos para evitar cualquier tipo de vulneraci n a la dignidad de las familias
4642630 hago mi llamado muy respetuoso a una instituci n a la que quiero y admiro que es la polic a nacional para que sus comandantes en todas las ciudades se ratifiquen como guardianes del bien p blico y en respetuosos agentes de los derechos humanos esa es una voz que se tiene que dar frente a todas las instancias de polic a que intervienen en estos procesos

4642633 por eso convocamos al sistema financiero para que presente sus productos al mercado es decir a las empresas del ramo
4642634 eso deja ver que hay recursos disponibles y para que fluyan adecuadamente en colombia es necesario pulir peque os detalles que tienen que ver con la estructuraci n de los proyectos
4642635 estamos tratando de concertar con el gobierno algunos ajustes la v a a buenaventura es un corredor que ya est bien avanzado en dobles calzadas pero no se puede quedar con ese cuello de botella en la l nea

4642640 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4642641 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4642642 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming

4642645 la andropausia masculina o s ndrome de adam es un proceso natural evolutivo de la vida del hombre que consiste en la disminuci n de la testosterona la principal hormona de la actividad sexual afectando tambi n su entorno emocional su causa frecuente puede ser primaria por alteraci n en los test culos o secundaria por alteraci n en el eje hipot lamo hip fisis
4642646 no se trata de darle testosterona a un hombre con el nivel bajo de l bido porque en ese caso no funciona
4642647 existen dos tratamientos muy efectivos el primero es a trav s de la aplicaci n de un gel con hormona de testosterona que se pone sobre la piel y se libera lentamente durante 24 horas y la segunda alternativa es la inyecci n intramuscular a base de testosterona que se debe aplicar cada tres meses
4642648 lo que sucede es que la inyecci n es una alternativa m s c moda porque sus efectos se prolongan por m s tiempo y no es lo mismo aplicarse una inyecci n cada tres meses que tomar una pastilla a diario
4642649 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death

4642665 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
4642666 believe this believe that don t ask questions don t think for yourself

4642668 and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven

4642682 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4642683 the fully dedicated sub system is comprised of a low voltage arm processor and flash memory that runs independent of the main hard drive
4642684 no podemos hacer m s m sica a menos que vivamos un poco
4642685 public comments serve a broader purpose than just trying to alter the administrations opinion
4642686 cuando warner bros decidi mover a harry potter y el misterio del pr ncipe para el verano del 2009 vimos la excelente oportunidad de colocar nuestra pelicula en su lugar la cual ha estado ganando una gran expectativa y est teniendo su gran momento durante los ultimos meses
4642687 no estamos tratando de ocupar el lugar de la incre ble franquicia de potter en el 2008 sino que s lo estamos tratando de darle a los fan ticos de los incre bles libros de stephenie meyer el filme lo m s pronto posible

4642690 the left and their handmaidens the mani stream media were so quick to deflect this hit it seems we have hit a raw nerve i intend to keep digging stay tuned
4642691 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
4642692 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
4642693 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through
4642694 madonna is at the end of a 30 year cycle in her life a true maturing is happening now its a time when the body starts to show age
4642695 going forward she may grow into playing the role of grand dame of the music industry over the next two years well see another face another reinvention of herself that we have not yet witnessed in the past
4642696 she does best in the city of los angeles but in london she shines in a regal way new york is a more stressful city in that saturn is stronger there causing her to feel pressured to work harder
4642697 she should be careful of her health during this two year period as neptune transiting her house of health can possibly bring a health crisis
4642698 its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits
4642699 an eclipse on her sun does indicate a big year ahead for her possibly major shifts in her relationship with her husband and the role he plays in her life she may be relating to the world and seeking a deeper metaphysical life experience more than she is relating to her partner
4642700 eclipses come in cycles the last time madonna experienced this particular eclipse cycle was when she met and became involved with her current husband guy ritchie the cycle before that one was when she and her first husband sean penn got divorced so her marriage may experience some challenges now
4642701 as saturn moves over her moon later this autumn 08 there are usually some changes in the home this could be a move an additional home adopting another child or perhaps one of her children such as her daughter lourdes may decide to study in another city

4642706 i lose more balls than anyone on the course because i wont go in the rough to get them there are snakes everywhere and they give me the willies
4642707 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine
4642708 but then the second doctor told me i had it i was in denial i dont understand exactly what it is the symptoms seem to apply to everyone around me in the industry loss of memory starting something and not finishing it
4642709 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place
4642710 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4642711 we decided we didnt want publicity we wanted to get married just between ourselves and our children and the judge who is an old friend of the family
4642712 i realised that i hear about these secret celebrity marriages the day after they happen and i dont think anybody is really trying to have a truly secret marriage but most of the fans and most of the media dont even know that im married
4642713 it can be a total secret theres no reason why the helicopters have to show up we were originally gonna do it on a public beach some place until we found out you have to register to do that and get a permit so immediately theyd call up the media and the paparazzi would be showing up
4642714 thats why we ended up doing it in michaels private backyard he lives at the beach and we were barefoot in the water it was a gorgeous day
4642715 tidak akan masuk jannah surga barang siapa di dalam hatinya terdapat setitik kesombongan
4642716 sesungguhnya orang itu menyukai pakaian yang bagus sandal yang bagus
4642717 sesungguhnya allah itu indah menyukai keindahan sombong itu adalah menolak kebenaran dan merendahkan orang lain
4642718 tidak akan masuk al jannah surga barang siapa di dalam hatinya terdapat setitik kesombongan
4642719 negeri akhirat al jannah itu kami sediakan untuk orang orang yang tidak ingin menyombongkan diri dan berbuat kerusakan di muka bumi dan kesudahan yang baik itu adalah bagi orang orang yang bertakwa
4642720 sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wataala itu mencintai orang orang yang bertaubat dan orang orang yang mensucikan diri
4642721 dan janganlah kamu berjalan di muka bumi ini dengan takabbur sombong karena sesungguhnya kamu sekali kali tidak akan dapat menembus bumi dan sekali kali kamu tidak akan sampai setinggi gunung
4642722 kebenaran itu adalah sesuatu yang datang dari allah maka janganlah kamu termasuk orang orang yang ragu
4642723 niscaya kamu tidak akan bisa tidak ada yang mencegahmu kecuali takabbur
4642724 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyalahi perintah rasul takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa adzab yang pedih
4642725 dan janganlah kamu memalingkan mukamu dari manusia karena sombong dan janganlah kamu berjalan di muka bumi dengan angkuh sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang takabbur lagi membanggakan diri
4642726 tiga golongan yang allah tidak berbicara kepada mereka pada hari kiamat tidak pula mensucikan dosa dosa mereka tidak memandang mereka dan bahkan mereka akan mendapat siksa yang pedih yaitu orang tua yang berzina penguasa yang pendusta dan orang miskin yang takabbur
4642727 keperkasaan adalah sarungku dan kesombongan adalah selendangku dan barang siapa yang menanggalkan sifat ku niscaya aku akan menyiksanya

4642732 dar un paso en el parlamento para que los recursos destinados a los partidos pol ticos sean transferidos para apoyar las urgentes necesidades de este sector
4642733 la asamblea considera que estas personas se merecen un programa integral que resuelva sus necesidades b sicas laborales de vivienda salud educaci n por tanto un bono aislado de tres mil bolivianos constituye 500 millones de bolivianos por a o que no podr a cubrir el presupuesto general de la naci n

4642741 it was a great performance but it was so heartbreaking for shawn i could see how disappointed she was
4642742 ive said this before many times its really dangerous to be the it girl the year before the olympics on the one hand you have the enormous publicity and the endorsement money the other side of the sword are the expectations and pressure
4642743 the difference was a small slip on my grip on the high bar
4642744 but in most cases if you go against the athletic types the athletic types win mary lou retton carly patterson those types beat out longer lankier athletes who cant stick the landings like mighty mites history shows the shawn johnson type athlete usually wins because the scoring system rewards the athlete
4642745 so what we did there was like 30 or 40 of us we actually lifted that bus off of her and pulled her from under the bus
4642746 the people in the field got this woman out from under the bus and got her here quickly the hospital responded quickly
4642747 the trauma surgeons were here the administrators were here the nurses and everyone that needed to be involved here were here quickly
4642748 if the person hasnt been able to unify their own party it makes it hard to make the case to unify the country

4642763 but whether the constitution really be one thing or another this much is certain that it has either authorized such a government as we have had or has been powerless to prevent it in either case it is unfit to exist
4642764 according to the results of a rasmussen survey released today 47 of our fellow countrymen 47 believe the government should require all radio and television stations to offer equal amounts of conservative and liberal political commentary this is up from the 41 results of july 2007

4642770 a federal appeals court has overruled a lower court ruling that if sustained would have severely hampered the enforceability of free software licenses the lower court had found that redistributing software in violation of the terms of a free software license could constitute a breach of contract but was not copyright infringement the difference matters because copyright law affords much stronger remedies against infringement than does contract law if allowed to stand the decision could have neutered popular copyleft licenses such as the gpl and creative commons licenses the district court decision was overturned on wednesday by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
4642771 when our community is challenged by decisions made and being made by our leaders
4642772 it is a challenge for everyone to respond in a way that reflects our commitment to peace it would be judicious for our government leaders to listen to what the youth have to say
4642773 among these activities are training of madaris gurus who teach values formation to the youth there have been youth camps that provide muslim and christian youth as well as youth from different religious traditions to come together and forge bonds of friendship youth with talents for news writing have been trained to hone these skills so that they might use the press to promote the ideals of dialogue peace and harmony which are at the core of silsilahs vision and mission

4642785 the ultimate insult to people who require assistance from government is to give them that assistance one year and then because of a budget situation yank the rug out from under them another year
4642786 we would have to go back into the budget and cut all the rest in order to meet that cap

4642797 hed vomit sometimes but you know it often happens with children
4642798 even doctors said that it was natural and by the time he got 1 year old he was afraid to eat because he knew what it ended with he was so thin
4642799 the tumor was absolutely benign one year has passed and there are no relapses but the tumor was situated in the bulbar zone which is responsible for swallowing and after the operation danya ceased to swallow we hoped that the reflex would be restored but well alas it didnt come true
4642800 it seems he comprehends more than he supposedly can after the operation he grew up
4642801 he knows many letters and its a developing method it really works you see everything is ok with his intellect
4642802 as to pediatricians theyd only say theyre afraid to even read the abstract of the record to the end
4642803 their tone has been maintained and swallowing can be restored with the right treatment and rehabilitation unfortunately its impossible to carry it out in st petersburg or in this country on the whole there are no specialists here there are specialists in germany

4642808 with the higher cost of gas and cost of living and everything more people are staying home and more people their budget is stretched and theres more of a need for the services that these churches provide
4642809 its the best thing i ever did for my hair
4642810 fills in the natural defects of the hair shaft which makes the hair look smoother and silkier but it does not actually straighten the hair
4642811 the straightening occurs from the heating process combined with the formaldehyde causing it to appear straighter
4642812 the customer the stylist whoever is in the vicinity are at risk during the application
4642813 formaldehyde at this concentration can have short term health effects coughing nausea and skin irritation
4642814 i guess that im vain so id rather have pretty hair than worry about cancer
4642815 i had nice body and my hair was so shiny and soft its amazing

4642824 although the game suffers from a few minor bugs including a small number of missions that dont show as completed when finished some computer controlled teammates that have trouble following orders and occasional glitches when switching between movement and hacking mode the pc version of mass effect is superior to the xbox 360 release the mouse and keyboard controls are so natural that they improve the games performance at practically every level

4642829 battlefield bad company may look like other fpses on the market in terms of theme and graphics but there are enough key gameplay differences to set it apart from the crowd one could easily say that bad company expands the genre itself with its combination of great story destructible environment and surprisingly deep single mode multiplayer

4642843 if youve ever loved any one of the metal gear games or any moments from the series there will come a moment when mgs 4 will send your spirits soaring if youve loved them all well then therell be many many more its a masterpiece
4642844 exactly you cant punish a game for doing something it has done forever a trademark if you will no one punishes gta for doing what its good at no punishes nintendo games for doing what theyre good at and no one punishes artsy games like bioshock and ico for being well artsy
4642845 for instance youre amazed at the beauty of the graphics and art direction the complexity of the story and the elaborately gorgeous cutscenes but once you get through with it you dont ever wanna play it again
4642846 mgs cutscenes are arguably something of a gameplay mechanic and if said mechanic is outdated its fair game for criticism
4642847 i suspect however that if you gave mgs4 to someone who isnt familiar with the series that it would have a more down to earth score a la the edge review
4642848 its also fair to cut mgs4 down based on having to have played the previous games to really appreciate it which i believe the edge review and others noted
4642849 so if someone didnt play mgs3 are they going to understand whats happening in 4
4642850 mgs4 is not the game it could have been nor is it the game it would have been had the series grown with the benefit of hindsight nor is it the game it should have been if you believed that early trailer
4642851 in years to come as people stand before the grave marked tactical espionage action they ll feel little choice but to salute
4642852 there is little doubt among consumers about the likelihood of a recession
4642853 there is no question that oil going down will help the consumer
4642854 but i think youve got to balance it against all of the other issues that the consumer faces
4642855 macro economic conditions remained weak and the selling environment particularly as we moved into the back to school selling period was tough
4642856 its the first time ive heard parents tell their children this is all we can afford this year
4642857 maybe numbers are being cut low enough that expectations can be met or even beat
4642858 many people were able to count on these rebates and allocate some of them for back to school
4642859 were expecting that some of them socked a bit of their rebate check away for the holiday season

4642875 we have certain signs in certain areas where the housing markets are coming back where the sales of houses are increasing and so on
4642876 what im saying is we have hit i think the bottom
4642877 and so im optimistic that it could turn around and that we slowly see again homes being sold and therefore creating more jobs
4642878 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
4642879 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
4642880 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
4642881 its going to be built on top of the foundations laid out by vista and server 2008 but it will not increase hardware requirements

4642890 26 of respondents in 2007 felt that social media is
4642891 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4642892 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4642893 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4642894 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4642895 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4642896 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4642897 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4642898 in terms of attacking options we really are down to the bare bones but we have plenty of variety in midfield and hopefully that will enough for us to get through the first hurdle

4642902 so how can you win your next case how can you win your next argument in the courtroom or at home how real and how credible can you be
4642903 rather than discovering our story we are busy retelling their story

4642905 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4642906 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4642907 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4642909 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4642910 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4642911 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4642912 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4642913 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4642914 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4642917 ik kwam in de tweede helft in de ploeg bij een 1 0 voorsprong en maakte de 2 0 en bereidde onze derde goal voor
4642918 waarom zou ik me laten opereren als ik niet belemmerd wordt in mijn bewegingen
4642919 carola moet nu geopereerd worden het is onverantwoord om met deze kwetsuur verder te judo n
4642920 het is jammer voor dennis dat het zo moest lopen het is nooit leuk als een sporter zoiets overkomt
4642921 ik ga nu ook niet zeggen dat grim het beter gedaan zou hebben maar ik weet wel dat de beste zwaargewicht van dit moment thuis zat
4642922 charles van commen e de chef de mission heeft mij keurig gefeliciteerd met de prestatie van deborah hij stak mij een hart onder de riem omdat ik volgens hem ook een aandeel in het zilver had van de judobond heb ik echter nog steeds niets gehoord ik mis de waardering van die kant
4642923 rose is n van de beste mondiale spelers van de afgelopen twee jaar een geweldige aanwinst dus voor het klm open
4642924 we zijn juist erg blij dat hij nederland kiest om zijn kansen voor de ryder cup te vergroten
4642925 die houd ik nog even achter de hand met het oog op de ryder cup weet je nooit wie er op het laatste moment nog bij me aanklopt
4642926 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4642927 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4642928 sam gets to hide behind the camera i cant but i think hes planning on factoring that in
4642929 as like a major factor itd be a major liability you know ash runs out of breath or his back goes out and stuff like that
4642930 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
4642931 jerry was truly one of the great record men of all time
4642932 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4642933 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4642934 he knew what he was doing thats the first thing we sat for long hours listening to music before we decided what we would do and selecting various things
4642935 he knew how to keep the mood light and keep it fun
4642936 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4642937 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4642938 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4642939 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4642940 there had definitely been a musical revolution there revolutionary change in music and soul came into prominence
4642941 his voice sounded very strong and his laughter his spirit was great
4642942 im flattered the rivalship bought us thus early yet we sole had the v6 version available initially thus they are going to have to come back and buy another car
4642943 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4642944 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4642945 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4642946 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4642947 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4642948 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4642949 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4642950 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4642951 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4642952 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4642953 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4642954 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4642955 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4642956 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4642957 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4642958 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4642959 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4642960 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4642961 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4642962 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4642963 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4642964 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4642965 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4642966 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4642967 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4642968 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4642969 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4642970 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4642971 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4642972 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4642973 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4642974 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4642975 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4642976 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4642977 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4642978 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4642979 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4642989 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4642990 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4642991 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4642992 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4642993 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4642994 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4642995 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4642996 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4642997 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4642998 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4642999 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4643000 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4643001 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4643002 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4643003 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4643004 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4643005 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4643006 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4643031 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

4643081 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4643082 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

4643092 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4643093 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4643094 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

4643096 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4643102 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4643103 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4643105 such as in the poltergeist movies and from psychics like char margolis
4643106 which the bible warns of is a counterfeit of the true light what is
4643107 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
4643108 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
4643109 for such are false apostles deceitful workers into the apostles of christ
4643110 here we see the opposite response of changing ourselves submitting ourselves
4643111 romans 10 13 have you submitted to the righteousness of god which is christ jesus
4643112 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son doesnt the pope believe that jesus is the christ

4643114 false prophets appear to be of god on the outside like benny hinn and pat robertson but inwardly they are ravening wolves
4643115 pat robertson comments on pope john paul iis passing virginia beach va april 02 2005 i am deeply grieved as a great man passes from this world to his much deserved eternal reward john paul ii has been the most beloved religious leader of our age far surpassing in popular admiration the leader of any faith he has been a man of great warmth profound understanding deep spirituality and indefatigable vigor it was my great honor to meet with him at the residence of my good friend cardinal oconnor in new york and to sit in the consistory during the mass he conducted in central park i told him at the time how much the american people loved him and he merely smiled that love was shared not only in america but by millions all over the globe he has been a steady bridge in the transition of eastern europe from communism to freedom his personal magnetism brought together all christians in new bonds of understanding i pray for the cardinals of the catholic church that they might have god given wisdom in selecting the successor to this great man their task will not be easy but with god all things are possible
4643116 though some bible critics today claim that these scriptures dont concern lucifer verse 13 clearly proves that they do
4643117 other than the lord god there are only 3 beings ever mentioned as having been in the garden of eden adam eve and the serpent satan
4643118 lucifer was created upright but sin corrupted him as with all gods creation
4643119 god never created the devil demons or fallen man sin is the culprit
4643120 just as a beautiful young whorish woman who is as a whitened coffin filled with rotting dead mens bones so does satan appear as an angel of light deceiving the masses of earth
4643121 why is it that so many people today dont comprehend these warnings from the scriptures
4643122 more than any other group of unbelievers people are going to burn in hell because they followed men instead of gods word
4643123 god is love so let us lay aside our doctrinal differences and focus on loving and helping one another as jesus taught let us show the world that love is the answer
4643124 refers to anything which is against biblical teaching christians are to separate from the ungodly and from those who falsely claim to follow the teachings of the bible but do

4643163 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4643164 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4643165 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4643166 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4643202 you know you spend too much time on teh internets when
4643203 the company confirmed yesterday that the job cuts come in response to the earnings
4643204 gannett papers across the country have been quietly shedding jobs for more than a year as publishers struggled to make budget numbers but this is the first time the company has made an announcement on company wide job cuts
4643205 here in nashville that means that about 50 positions will be cut according to bob faricy the guy who returned our call to tennessean publisher ellen leifeld
4643206 faricy says that 40 of the jobs set for axing are already vacant and just wont be filled
4643207 the cost cutting has already gotten rather uncomfortable for folks at 1100 broadway theres a rumor see comments floating around that the air conditioning went kaput during last weeks heat spell because the guy who usually fixes it had taken a company buyout when the mercury started climbing tennessean bosses brought out fans electing not to fix the ac until the fall when repair prices are cheaper
4643208 wall street responds gannett shares rose 1 56 or 8 percent to 20 82 on the new york stock exchange many other newspaper shares rose as well on thursday
4643209 gannett is rewarded here by focusing on shareholder value and cutting payroll at a time when readership continues to sink because theres less and less relevant content for readers
4643210 as long as shareholder value is in the drivers seat for gannett theyll keep losing
4643211 the edge there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over the others the living are those who pushed their luck as far as they felt they could handle it and then pulled back or slowed down or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between now and later but the edge is still out there
4643212 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4643213 its always seemed to me that any organization county state or nation of people who dont care about their past their heritage cant expect much of the future
4643214 it was an absolutely unbelievable lighting strike i was a fist novelist it was about a war nobody cared about about germans nobody liked everything was against that book

4643221 our credibility has been stretched in so many ways so i dont think the public has a great deal of faith in us
4643222 just like we trust the reporter to represent what they see accurately were going to have to develop that same relationship with photographers
4643223 the public is losing faith in us without credibility we have nothing we cannot survive
4643224 after reading so much on line i surely found a connection with the non borderlines
4643225 the governments deliberate plan is to cause a dysfunctional chaotic parliament
4643226 must be preceded by a passive affirmative nonchallenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future
4643227 a liberal is someone who puts his foot down firmly on thin air
4643228 america was built by its radicals the hope and future of america lies with its radicals
4643229 this is the job for todays radical to fan the embers of hopelessness into a flame to fight
4643230 from militant indians to chicanos to puerto ricans to blacks from all parts of the black power spectrum from panthers to radical philosophers from a variety of campus activists s d s and others to a priest who was joining a revolutionary party in south america

4643237 a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
4643238 anyone who is working against the haves is always facing odds and in many cases heavy odds if he or she does not have that complete self confidence or call it ego that he can win then the battle is lost before it is even begun
4643239 ego must be so all pervading that the personality of the organizer is contagious that it converts the people from despair to defiance creating a mass ego
4643240 it is the schizophrenia of a free society that we outwardly espouse faith in the people but inwardly have strong doubts whether the people can be trusted
4643241 turn to an extreme chauvinism and become defenders of the american faith
4643242 activists and radicals on and off our college campuses people who are committed to change must make a complete turnabout
4643243 our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and way of life of the middle class they have stigmatized it as materialistic decadent bourgeois degenerate imperialistic war mongering brutalized and corrupt
4643244 the power and the people are in the big middle class majority

4643258 we appreciate the trust and confidence placed in us by such a respected professional organization and we look forward to bringing increased value and flexibility to gsaba members gsaba members play an important role in building a better community while making property more affordable we believe that transfer fee rights represent an important tool for developers and we take great pride in the long term funding solutions we help create for non profits
4643259 we have found freehold licensing to be a knowledgeable and professional organization that helps builders and developers restructure the economics of their projects in an important and valuable way in fact i truly believe that freeholds process of creating transfer fees represents an increasingly popular way of more fairly apportioning ever increasing development costs and in consequence helping to keep property affordable no longer can a builder or developer be content with business as usual in todays increasingly competitive environment it is important for builders and developers to look at every tool available that can help them stay competitive and deliver a better product at a more affordable price i believe freeholds system absolutely accomplishes this goal

4643269 there is also insufficient evidence in relation to the chain of command to establish if there was any person responsible for the chain of events that led to the death of mr lloyd
4643270 i understand that this will be very upsetting news for the family and friends of mr lloyd but i can reassure them that every care was taken in pursuing lines of inquiry and reviewing the evidence
4643271 it is clear from the forensic evidence that mr lloyd received injuries from both iraqi and american bullets and the forensic evidence suggests that the injury which caused his death was fired from a u s weapon
4643272 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong

4643285 tony blair granted him something of the power that walter bagehot ascribed to a constitutional monarch the right to be consulted the right to advise and the right to warn
4643286 since 1997 republicans have received only a slight majority 56 percent of the 4 76 million in campaign donations from the murdoch family and the news corporations political action committees and employees since democrats won control of congress in the 2006 elections the company and its employees have given more than twice as much to democrats as to republicans
4643287 some aspects of news corps programming positions and alliances serve conservative political ends and others do not but all are consistent with the use of political influence for corporate advantage
4643288 this information should blow away this silly assumption that more coverage is always better coverage

4643291 one of my unattained career goals was to do a childrens book and when kris brought bruce the little blue spruce to me i instantly knew this would be it
4643292 not only did i love the gentle message of accepting the differences in ourselves and others but the challenge of drawing a story where the principal character was a tree was too much to pass up
4643293 mary roach is the funniest science writer in the country if that sounds like faint praise or even an oxymoron theres proof to the contrary on almost any page of this book stiff tells us where the bodies are what theyre up to and the astonishing tales they still have to tell best of all it manages somehow to find humor in cadavers without robbing them of their dignity long live the dead
4643294 now that guy i need him to headline at my comedy club
4643295 that guy would be perfect for this multi million dollar role as the lead character in my new horror movie
4643296 barack came to me and said if alice decides she wants to run i want to run for her state senate seat
4643297 i think he was very strategic in his choice of friends and mentors
4643298 i spent ten years of my adult life working to be alderman i finally got elected this is a job i love and im perfectly happy with it im not sure thats the way that he approached his public life that he was going to try for a job and stay there for one period of time in retrospect i think he saw the positions he held as stepping stones to other things and therefore approached his public life differently than other people might have
4643299 its a church that would provide you with lots of social connections and prominent parishioners
4643300 its a good place for a politician to be a member
4643301 who you take money from is a reflection of your knowledge at the time and your principles
4643302 i dont think you should forget who your friends are
4643303 my view is you have to bring your constituency along with you granted you have to make some tough decisions granted sometimes you have to make decisions that people wont understand or like but its your obligation to explain yourself and try to do your supporters the courtesy of treating them with respect
4643304 all the work we did to help him get where he finally ended up he didnt seem too appreciative
4643305 can you get where he is and maintain your personal integrity
4643306 you just dont come to chicago and plant your flag
4643307 when i first came to chicago adlai stevenson and paul douglas were running for governor and senator
4643308 i had heard about the closed party closed machine but they sounded like such great candidates so i stopped in to volunteer in the eighth ward regular democratic headquarters
4643309 i then chronicled for the next four years her systematic abrogation of every commitment she had made to reform she became sort of a parody of a machine mayor
4643310 he saw the jagged edges of chicago politics and urban politics pretty close up
4643311 when i started organizing i understood the idea of social change in a very abstract way
4643312 it was to some extent informed by my years in indonesia seeing extreme poverty and disparities of wealth and understanding sort of in a dim way that life wasnt fair and government had something to do with it
4643313 but i didnt come out of a political family didnt have a history of activism in my family so i understood these things in the abstract when i went to chicago it was the first time that i had the opportunity to test out my ideas and for the most part i would say i wasnt wildly successful the victories that we achieved were extraordinarily modest you know getting a job training site set up or getting an after school program for young people put in place
4643314 i remember our first few meetings he would say do you know so and so and id say yes how well do you know him id really like to meet him i would set up some lunches
4643315 if you want to look at the means of ascent if you will look at project vote
4643316 was making connections at the grassroots level and was working with elected officials thats when he first got a scan of the broader black political infrastructure
4643317 is where a lot of the divisional rivalries popped up
4643318 black activists community folks felt that he didnt respect their role
4643319 he was typical of what most aspiring politicians are self centered that i can do anything and im willing to do it overnight
4643320 he met people not just in the african american community but in the progressive white community
4643321 the folks who funded project vote were some of the key progressive leaders
4643322 i honestly dont remember what it was about him but i was absolutely blown away
4643323 i said to several people that this guy who is now thirty years old is someday going to be president he will be our first black president
4643324 when you go work for judd miners law firm thats another kind of political statement
4643325 i think it might have been helpful with a certain group of people that barack may have wanted to have at his back at the outset so you get the support of the liberals and the progressives and the reformers and then that gives you a base to then expand to pick up other folks and then folks would be willing to give money to the bright shiny new candidate
4643326 theyve shown a remarkable willingness to take on the democratic organization and the democratic establishment in this city and win which is why i like them and a lot of people hate them
4643327 yeah yeah okay come over and meet my aunt gracie and dont tell anybody that
4643328 to some extent im a symbolic stand in for a lot of the changes that have been made
4643329 galvanized chicagos political community as no seasoned politico had before
4643330 under baracks leadership we had the most successful cost effective and orderly voter registration drive ive ever been involved with
4643331 i began to see my identity and my individual struggles were one with the struggles that folks face in chicago
4643332 they fall somewhere lower than lawyers i want to inspire a renewal of morality in politics i will work as hard as i can as long as i can on your behalf
4643333 barack obama carries on the tradition of independence in this district his candidacy is a passing of the torch
4643334 you have to understand its 1995 its the year after the republicans have taken over control of congress and in illinois all three branches of government were also controlled by the republicans so it was a really dark point i was looking to be engaged in something that would mean something that would actually get something done and that was beyond symbols around the same time that i started up with barack volunteering on his campaign i had gone to some of the old community groups and nationalist organizations i respected what they had done but i didnt feel like that was really where i wanted to be
4643335 when you go to a political meeting and you see a couple of guys or girls at the back of the room and they arent glad handing or anything those are the operators
4643336 i dont think he said he wanted to run for president but he indicated that he was into public service for the long haul
4643337 i remember very clearly i said to sam if this guy is for real he could be the first african american president of the united states
4643338 to step aside like other african americans have done in other races for the sake of unity and to release palmer from her commitment
4643339 i had given him my word i would support him
4643340 alice didnt forgive me and shes never going to forgive me
4643341 these old nationalist guys start beating a drum probably not the right metaphor about how barack should let this elder back in and how senioritys important
4643342 another local paper covering chicagos black community a comment in the
4643343 if she doesnt run that seat will go to a daley supporter we have asked her to reconsider not running because we dont think obama can win he hasnt been in town long enough nobody knows who he is we need someone with experience
4643344 he ran unopposed which is a good way to win
4643345 anyone who enters chicago politics and cant take the rough and tumble shouldnt be there losing the seat was just that not the end of the world
4643346 it established a reputation that youre not going to punk me youre not going to roll me over youre not going to jam me i think it established him as a threat you have his independence with project vote you have his refusal to knuckle under during the alice palmer thing and so now you have a series of data points that have some established leaders in the black community feeling disrespected and so the stage is now set for the comeuppance during the congressional race that was their payback
4643347 for the first time since it was enacted in 1935 we are about to repeal a core provision of the social security act
4643348 seems to me to be a classic example of somebody who had no reason to run youre seventy three years old youre already the third most powerful man in the country so why and bill clinton well his campaigns fascinating to a student of politics its disturbing to someone who cares about certain issues but politically it seems to be working
4643349 last year president clinton signed a bill that for the first time in 60 years eliminates the federal guarantee of support for poor families and their children
4643350 i am not a defender of the status quo with respect to welfare
4643351 having said that i probably would not have supported the federal legislation because i think it had some problems but im a strong believer in making lemonade out of lemons
4643352 i supported governor edgars plan to raise the income tax
4643353 were all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
4643354 politics are politics crime is crime but in chicago they occasionally overlap the line between virtue and vice meanders madly effective government on one side connections on the other
4643355 big labor and big capital blue and white collars and minorities
4643356 it became increasingly difficult to get into homes and apartments to talk about candidates
4643357 high rises were tough if not impossible to crack and other parts of the city had become too dangerous to walk around in for hours at a time and people didnt want to answer their doors thus the increasing dependence on tv radio direct mail phone banking robocalls et cetera all things that cost a hell of a lot more money than patronage workers who were themselves in decline anyway because of anti patronage court rulings
4643358 they do well and you get a 5 million to 10 million war chest
4643359 our relationship deepened when i started my first political campaign for the state senate
4643360 the developers were thinking in market terms and operating under the rules of the marketplace but at the same time we had government supporting and subsidizing those efforts
4643361 he hung around a lot of the downstaters they became good friends
4643362 it looked like two men that were having a serious disagreement and they had walked up to one another really close
4643363 hes the one that got mad because he said i embarrassed him on the senate floor thats when he came over to my desk
4643364 im not part of some long standing political organization i have no fancy sponsors im not even from chicago my name is obama despite that fact somebody sent me the men on the corner in woodlawn drowning their sorrows in alcohol the women working two jobs theyre all telling me we cant wait
4643365 ive got to make assessments about where we go from here
4643366 we need a new style of politics to deal with the issues that are important to the people whats not clear to me is whether i should do that as an elected official or by influencing government in ways that actually improve peoples lives
4643367 he thought he would get some help from daley because rush had run against daley for mayor
4643368 he thought that daley might use the opportunity to get even
4643369 when you lose a race you can be strong in another avenue and he was always strong in his congressional district it was a learning experience when i lost to harold washington the next day i endorsed him
4643370 you learn from defeat if you dont learn from defeat then you go away as a sour politician you think that people turned on you barack obama understood that the lesson from that campaign is you cant just run for any office saying you thought someone lost an election and you thought they were weak he realized that and he rededicated himself
4643371 even though the university of chicago is one of the largest employers on the south side of chicago it is seen by some particularly black nationalists as a bastion of white political power as a huge entity that doesnt take into account the interests of the community that doesnt have a full democratic partnership with the community and does what it wants to the community in maintaining clear boundaries about where black people are
4643372 you know the north side and the south side of like two different worlds
4643373 the accusations were that obama was sent here and owned by the jews
4643374 that he was here to steal the black vote and steal black land and that he was represented by the as they were called the white man and that obama wasnt black enough and didnt know the black experience the black community it was quite deafening in terms of how they went after alderman preckwinkle and myself people would say oh kindle man we trust you you being fooled obamas got you fooled and some people called me a traitor
4643375 the first time i heard him talk to a black church he was very professorial more so even than he was in the white community there was no joking no self deprecation no style it didnt go over well at all
4643376 i remember one of the candidates in the race used to talk about how crazed our volunteers were because they were passionate energized
4643377 youd come by the office on eighty seventh street and thered be a bunch of guys with no teeth waiting to get their next old grand dad and then these shiraz drinking nation reading t n r quoting young black folk it was a random ass mix it was beautiful though when i see the crowds now theyre very reminiscent of what was happening then
4643378 he learned that for barack obama it was not the type of district that he was well suited for
4643379 the type of campaign that he had to run to win that district is not barack obama it was a predominantly african american district it was a district where you had to campaign solely on those issues and barack did not campaign that way and so as a result he lost which was good
4643380 he saw that when we were doing fund raisers in the rush campaign his appeal to quite frankly young white professionals was dramatic
4643381 the exposure he would get to some of the folks that were on boards of the museums and c e o s of some of the companies that he would represent would certainly help him in the long run
4643382 there is a conflict of interest built into the process
4643383 incumbents drawing their own maps will inevitably try to advantage themselves
4643384 the world as it is and not as we would like it to be
4643385 i was very proud to be able to introduce him during the senate race to a lot of people who have turned out to be important and valuable to him not just here but in new york and l a
4643386 i try and think about people who i think should know him
4643387 everybody came in and all they cared about was their districts it wasnt any one particular legislator from any one particular community i learned a lot about state government their job was not to respond to september 11th they were more worried about making sure that they had a district that they could run in for re lection
4643388 he was one of the main people we wanted but he was speaking at the university of wisconsin that day
4643389 professors are being turned in on college campuses bushs ratings are eighty seven per cent
4643390 among my friends there hasnt been an antiwar demonstration in twenty years theres huge repression bush has got all this legislation theyre talking about lists theyre denying people entry into the country bushs numbers were tremendously high but we had no choice unless we wanted to live in a country that was fascist
4643391 he was a hyde park state senator he had to oppose the war
4643392 let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an antiwar rally i stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances
4643393 the civil war was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil i dont oppose all wars my grandfather signed up for a war the day after pearl harbor was bombed fought in pattons army he saw the dead and dying across the fields of europe he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered auschwitz and treblinka he fought in the name of a larger freedom part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil and he did not fight in vain i dont oppose all wars
4643394 he didnt start telling people he was interested in running for senate until he figured out what the road map was
4643395 he had a good sense of the odds and he knew there were certain things that had to happen
4643396 then he just laid out an economic analysis it becomes about money because he knew that if people knew his story they would view him as a better candidate than anybody else he thought might be in the field and so he said therefore if you raise five million dollars i have a fifty per cent chance of winning if you raise seven million dollars i have a seventy per cent chance of winning if you raise ten million dollars i guarantee victory
4643397 participated in a small group that met weekly when rod was running for governor
4643398 we basically laid out the general election barack and i and these two
4643399 there was an advisory council that was inclusive of rahm and barack but not limited to them
4643400 he had been my client and i had a very good relationship with him but i didnt sign on to the governors race
4643401 obviously he won but i had concerns about it i was concerned about whether he was ready for that not so much for the race but for governing i was concerned about some of the folks i was concerned about how the race was being approached
4643402 the political bosses knew they had to have what they used to call in business a loss leader the showcasing
4643403 the car that you sold for under its value for advertising purposes while you had at the top of your ticket a shining star under that it was like turning over a rock
4643404 i guess he figured i was part of the establishment
4643405 he didnt know too much about politics and he was very idealistic
4643406 provided himself with tens of thousands of dollars in interest free loans from his campaign fund
4643407 has always made it a practice to pay back the loans and continues to do so
4643408 when he ran that race against bobby rush he had no one supporting him who had political influence over others and whom people respected so he was out there as a lone wolf in that race
4643409 we never discussed it but he had to analyze that race and recognize he had no other powerful elected officials supporting him
4643410 and so he felt i could be very very key if he was going to make the run for the u s senate
4643411 in politics you must know who is connected to whom
4643412 the mayor of chicago and the father of dan hynes
4643413 because he had been in the minority barack didnt have a legislative record to run on and there was a buildup of all these great ideas that the republicans kept in the rules committee when they were in the majority
4643414 jones basically gave obama the space to do what obama wanted to do emil made it clear to people that it would be good for them
4643415 you have the power to make a united states senator
4643416 i am not thrilled with barack simply because we elected him as an independent and he switched over to daley
4643417 when he won the primary out here and he went downtown it appears as though daley took over the campaign for him we were excluded
4643418 i think theres kind of this wizard of oz mystique
4643419 she got as the saying goes run over by a bus
4643420 we were talking about whether he was ready to do this or not
4643421 as i see it the two things that youre going to need to address are your executive leadership skills because your r sum doesnt have that in it and the second would be your credentials in national security
4643422 my dad told me that youve got to strike while the iron is hot
4643423 we were walking down the street late in the afternoon
4643424 and this crowd was building behind us like it was tiger woods at the masters
4643425 yeah if you think its bad today wait until tomorrow
4643426 itu hanya hubungan baik saja tanpa embel embel kalau melanggar hukum tetap juga kena
4643427 there was a light that goes on and off and that was one red light
4643428 if he goes out there where its getting deeper it makes me nervous
4643429 as soon as he gets in the water it makes me nervous
4643430 we dont have the resources to send like we would in the middle of the summer
4643431 if your on an outlying beach its harder for us to mount a response to you
4643432 were over 300 rescues in the summer so the likelihood of getting in trouble is great
4643433 not only do you add a layer of protection to preserving their historic integrity but you also open the doors to grant money
4643434 what i was concerned about was giving the dunes area which is looked upon for the last couple of years as natural history some human history as well theres nothing else like it in the state in terms of what happened there in the past
4643435 the conclusion overwhelmingly was that we have a national treasure here they recommended that we petition the various local governments to consider designating the sites and landscapes that need public recognition
4643436 once the local government does that then it goes before a state review board but usually by the time it gets to that point its a done deal
4643437 if it were a historic district then the township would have certain statutory rights in determining what happens there were trying to get a consultant to help these communities sort everything out
4643438 when you have a designated historic district there are certain federal and state guidelines that have to be adhered to so if there were anything built on the mcclendon property they would have to conform to those guidelines it certainly doesnt preclude development but it would restrict what could be built
4643439 steve neumers never talked to me about it although one of our missions is the preservation of the natural landscape
4643440 i havent looked at it or studied it at this point
4643441 if you look in the oxbow lagoon you can see remnants of where they used to launch logs its very nice
4643442 ive heard there are some interesting things there about 90 feet under the sand
4643443 what do you think about banning pier jumping at holland state park
4643444 everybody has a time to stand up and that was our time
4643445 because something could be said that wasnt being said and that was cool
4643446 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4643447 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4643448 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4643449 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4643450 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4643451 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4643452 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4643458 god please send my other half make me feel alive
4643459 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4643460 weve lodged documents seeking declarations that he is in fact entitled to be adequately compensated and weve asked that the matter be referred to an associate judge for an audit to be done
4643461 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions its amazing where this series has been shown theres merchandising involved dvds so yes i think it could be millions
4643462 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4643463 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4643464 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4643465 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4643466 when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming

4643475 it is fine to find ways to nurture yourself away from your child but when not available enjoy the ride if you knew how close the end of this period is maybe it would be easier to relax and enjoy each moment discover that time for yourself is time with your child being with your child is the way your nurture yourself it is a treat available for a fleeting moment it is the gift you chose to give to yourself by bringing this child ren into your life being with the joys of mothering now is fulfilling fearing that you are missing something or needing a clean house is painful when the children become independent you will find that your interests have changed anyway or that you can pick them up further than where you left them these former skills may or may not be relevant to you any more life moves only forward attaching to the past hurts and separates us from the happy moment of now and now and now without the wish to do something else you love the moment fully and peacefully enjoy it like the rest of life it is a passing ride that gives no second chance

4643646 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column
4643647 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
4643648 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs

4643662 even if it were true which i know its not the 128 people are in no way close to the millions of people that the polish people herded towards the germans so they could be extinguished i believe its just a consistent polish antisemitism and the poles are sloughing off their own crimes of being an enemy of the jews during world war ii

4643829 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
4643830 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
4643831 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4643832 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare

4643835 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
4643836 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
4643837 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4643838 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing

4643842 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
4643843 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
4643844 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
4643845 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
4643846 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
4643847 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
4643848 the omagh fatality list reads like a microcosm of troubles deaths and left no section of irish life untouched the town they attacked is roughly 60 40 catholic protestant and the dead consisted of protestants catholics a mormon and two spanish visitors they killed young old and middle aged fathers mothers sons daughters and grannies they killed republicans and unionists including a prominent local member of the ulster unionist party they killed people from the backbone of the gaelic athletic association they killed unborn twins bright students cheery shop assistants and many young people they killed three children from the irish republic who were up north on a day trip everyone they killed was a civilian the toll of death was thus both extraordinarily high and extraordinarily comprehensive
4643849 im only after getting a call from a man with a country accent saying theres a bomb in omagh main street near the courthouse a 500lb bomb its going to go off in 30 minutes
4643850 i have received a bomb call for omagh town centre approximately 200 yards from the courthouse and the code word malta pope was given
4643851 theres a bomb courthouse omagh main street 500 pounds explosion 30 minutes
4643852 am i through to omagh this is a bomb warning its going to go off in 30 minutes
4643853 part of the ongoing war against the brits we offer apologies to the civilians
4643854 nobody thought there was going to be a bomb in omagh everybody thought it was a hoax
4643855 three women in a shop ill go for a walk somewhere else
4643856 i was just back from my lunch about ten minutes and had walked straight past the car and everything and two minutes before i was hanging out the window cause a girl that i worked with was walking past the bottom she was going out home and you know we were kind of chatting to her out the window i mean if it had went off then id have been killed id say because or a lot worse
4643857 i was in the kitchen and heard a big bang everything fell on me the cupboards blew off the wall the next thing i got blasted out into the street there was smashed glass everywhere bodies children people were inside out
4643858 i met my friend and we decided to go on down to the bus depot and as we were walking down there just past mcelroys shoe shop we were right in the middle of the road then the bomb went off i was thrown to the ground so i was and obviously i couldnt run or nothing and i saw my leg and all well i just thought ill never be able to walk again you know and then you just have to wait for somebody to come so i sat there and there was a lot of screaming around but i didnt i must have been in shock cause i didnt scream or nothing i just sat and waited
4643859 first of all there was like this massive bang which ill and then you just heard you know glass and roofs falling and you know just and then there was silence for a while and then it was like just screaming and shouting and complete mayhem it was quite scary
4643860 there was smoke coming from the brow of the hill and we stopped in our tracks for what seemed like an eternity and then we just ran towards it
4643861 i ran into the front of kells what was left of it and i went in through where the window would have been and i found the wife lying face down in the rubble now the clothes was blew off her and the first thing i reached for was her arm and i tried for her pulse there was no life i knew she was dead and then i couldnt get there was no sign of shauna or tracey and i knew they were in the shop with her and i started lifting lumps of timber and everything was carnage but there was still no sign of shauna and i thought she was dead i thought she was under the rubble thought she was buried under her mother i found tracey my second daughter on her knees beside her mammy trying her pulse like a woman who went to omagh twice a year to do shopping about the only two days she went was to get the uniforms and christmas
4643862 there were limbs lying about that had been blown off people everyone was running round trying to help people there was a girl in a wheelchair screaming for help who was in a bad way there were people with cuts on their heads bleeding one young boy had half of his leg completely blown off he didnt cry or anything he was just in a complete state of shock
4643863 it was horrible so much blood and flesh and glass sticking out of people
4643864 the first thing i noticed was what i suppose was a shop dummy lying in the middle of the street so i knew then there was people injured cause i could see everybody coming running with blood and one thing or another after i passed the first shop dummy that i saw lying in the street out of one of the clothes shops the next thing i saw in the street again was what i thought was another shop dummy but unfortunately that wasnt that was either a man or a woman ive no idea what it was but it was just a body and there were neither legs or arms or anything to be seen on it it was a sight that ill not forget anyway thats for sure and that was only one there was a lot of other sights lying on that street that really yet is still hard to describe how anybody could do that to innocent people i have no idea
4643865 there were bodies strewn all over the street it was like a battlefield of burning flesh and dead bodies with a burst water main spraying everywhere i helped lift six bodies out and did all i could for some of the injured people men women and children were lying on the road dazed and bleeding people were groaning children were crying and there was an overwhelming smell of burning flesh
4643866 there was an awful lot of water because there was burst water mains there were people lying dead and the water was just gushing over the top of them the other striking thing was there was so much blood there was blood literally everywhere an awful lot of blood on the footpath and on the road a lot of the policemen were splattered from head to toe in blood and i really mean that they were putting people who were either dead badly maimed or injured into sheets or anything they could find and just sort of dragging them down to the bottom end of the town they were waiting for any available ambulance or car to put the people into
4643867 to see that body lying in the street with smoke sort of rising from it and the smell on the street
4643868 there were limbs hanging off bodies being carried on doors everything was chaotic then just as the bus was ready to leave the door opened and someone handed a severed arm in i think that was just too much for the driver i think he cried all the way to the hospital
4643869 it was like a scene from hell i wasnt able to drive fast because people were screaming in pain as we went over the ramps at the hospital i could hear the roars of pain
4643870 nothing could have prepared me for what i saw people were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there was blood all over the place people were crying for help and looking for something to kill the pain other people were crying out looking for relatives you could not really be trained for what you had seen unless you were trained in vietnam or somewhere like that
4643871 when i came to the front of the hospital it was absolutely quiet
4643872 we ran from here to the hospital and we went in and it was just room after room after room of children some were in wheelchairs bandaged others were lying on stretchers others were just simply huddled in the corner no parents god only knows what happened to them we worked our way through the crowd and at the bottom were our two children with their friend and my mother daughter was remarkably calm and lacerations the lacerations were confined really to her hairline from what we gathered she was obviously very distressed she bled quite profusely
4643873 he was crouched down against the wall with his head in his hands he told me that his wife was dead and his children were missing i covered him up with a sheet and put my arms around him but there was nothing else i could do there was also a young boy of about 11 or 12 strapped into a stretcher his hair was burnt and standing on end and he was deathly white he kept staring at me with huge frightened eyes that image will haunt me for ever
4643874 i stayed in ward five with a local lady doing what i could until she was air lifted to altnagelvin hospital in derry for further treatment
4643875 what chance have any of us got when we are told the bomb is at a courthouse when the actual target is the ordinary townspeople in a busy shopping area hundreds of yards away there can be no ifs or buts about this there are no so called legitimate targets there can be no excuse whatever for putting the lives of hundreds of people at risk such people serve no cause but that of murder and mayhem with the help of the decent people of northern ireland we will do everything in our power to ensure those responsible for this outrage are brought to justice
4643876 to be bold lads who ripped the heart out of omagh
4643877 at the end of the first week i actually was allowed access to one part of the building by the police it was under very special circumstances because the forensic had not finished their work it was quite late at night and it was into the nicholl amp shiels corner basically it was to assess the restaurant area above there were some very obvious structural cracks and that again is a memory that will always be with me as we walked through the building the rain was coming through the roof we scanned the torch it was a very very eerie feeling maybe 20 to 30 tables with lunches cups of coffee exactly the way they had been when the bomb went off and that particular building was packed at that stage and then you felt a stickiness on your feet and as i turned the torch down i realised i was walking on blood the whole way along the building so you can only imagine what it must have been like at the time for the people in there
4643878 all we want is that my youngsters and everybody elses youngsters it doesnt matter whether theyre catholic protestant hindu or whatever religion they are that they can go to school come home and their fathers and mothers are there and theyre not afraid that every time they walk down the street if someone drops a bin lid that its a bomb
4643879 i am totally horrifed by this action i condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever
4643880 it is a ghastly act a cruel act we will ruthlessly suppress those reponsible for the attack this is the most evil deed in years from our point of view we will continue to work in dealing with this particular group with the ruc and the gardai
4643881 this is an appalling act of savagery there is total determination to bring the perpetrators to justice but an equal determinatiion that they will not be allowed to destroy the process
4643882 the people who perpetrated the omagh bombing are addicted to violence and have no place in a civilised society
4643883 on behalf of every american i condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly i extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy i renew my pledge to stand with the people of northern ireland against the perpetrators of violence they will find no friends here
4643884 there must be decisive action to stop the terrorists who are committed to bringing death and destruction
4643885 the sort of people who would plant this device arent interested in anything other than murder i can only come to the conclusion that bloody murder was their intent
4643886 to bring such sadness and suffering to the people of omagh at this stage is a crime against humanity
4643887 it is clear that the people who carried out this terrible deed today are not only appalling murderers they are undiluted fascists
4643888 it was an indefensible action those responsible are aligning themselves with the forces opposed to a democratic settlement of the conflict here
4643889 i was shocked to hear of the appalling crime in omagh which resulted in so many deaths and injuries please pass on my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved injured and those others who have suffered in their distress
4643890 it is the nio who spawned the process of buying off the terrorists and encouraging the gun
4643891 this atrocity would not have happened if the ira had handed over its weapons and explosives sinn fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody atrocity
4643892 this is the most horrific event in the history of northern ireland
4643893 i remember only too well feeling deeply angered when my great uncle lord mountbatten and other relations were blown to pieces nineteen years ago i remember so well feeling that so i can understand a little some of the feelings perhaps of those who lost their loved ones on this occasion
4643894 it is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable murder can never be excused or justified the people of northern ireland will treat the statement and its authors with the contempt they deserve
4643895 it is a pathetic attempt at an excuse for mass murder it is contemptable and it is an insult to the people of omagh
4643896 we are facing an enormous task requiring meticulous examination of literally tons of rubble this additional help represents a very significant increase in our ability to extract as quickly as humanly possible every last piece of evidence in what is a very complex jigsaw
4643897 these were the words of chief superintendent eric anderson when announcing the largest murder investigation ever in northern ireland in which specialists were called in from londons metropolitan police to assist the ruc
4643898 a number of similar bombs had been intercepted near the border in the preceding months sure enough the real ira admitted responsibility a few days after the bomb
4643899 we have a full team continually working on this investigation we have been working in close co operation with a number of other police forces we are pursuing a number of inquiries and it is likely that more arrests will follow but we still need help from the public
4643900 the fund will be used for the benefit of those who died or were injured as a result of the omagh bomb their relatives and dependants and those persons who have been adversely affected by the tragedy
4643901 what can i say i could finish out at the border with a hole in my head

4643927 very little of it is actually harmful to really anything in the environment
4643928 i dont have a concern because we have a nice system to deal with it

4643931 was recognised by sadc itself as not free and fair and not reflective of the democratic will
4643932 mugabe should not be recognised as a head of state
4643933 sadc has repeatedly said it will not recognise unconstitutional changes in government and we intend holding them to this commitment
4643934 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4643935 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4643936 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4643937 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4643938 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4643939 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4643940 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4643941 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4643942 we will rebuild we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4643943 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4643944 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4643945 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4643946 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4643947 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4643948 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people
4643949 now its coming back and with the latest increase in gasoline prices we are seeing enormous interest

4643964 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4643965 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4643966 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4643967 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4643968 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4643969 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4643970 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4643971 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4643973 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4643974 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4643975 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4643976 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere
4643977 there has been a concern of my living quarters i would like to publicly address those concerns
4643978 i wanted to make sure that the board didnt have any questions for me that i could answer so this is public and put the rumors to rest
4643979 if any rules have been broken the prescribed penalties shall be put in place immediately or as soon as possible
4643980 i am asking that a full investigation take place asap

4643982 if you can tell me how many hours a week or month i have to sleep under that roof i will abide by that
4643983 this is political backstabbing and you know where its coming from
4643984 until he actually moves and changes his residency i dont have any reason to question it
4643985 once your voter registration changes that is a red flag to me as far as i know he hasnt changed anything
4643986 i did tell him that if he moved out of the district he would have to resign and we would hold a special election
4643987 your intent has to be to move out of the district
4643988 now if it took them four years to build it back
4643989 if somebody else was using that same address it could become an issue
4643990 i definitely dont want this guy out of office if he hasnt violated any rules
4643991 the indictments allegations are disturbing because customers thought they were getting legitimate and safe prescription drugs over the internet from canada at cheaper prices when in reality they received adulterated fakes that were crudely made in an unsanitary house in belize
4643992 he said that really wouldnt do anything because were collecting at 50 percent right now if we were collecting at 100 percent it would be more detrimental
4643993 we are concerned our transportation impact fee is so high that it is encouraging all kinds of different behaviors
4643994 if they annex we still end up with the same transportation issues were just in a position where we cant collect impact fees
4643995 were collecting from everybody but them to do an 11 million project on their property
4643996 im not sure that i think that any of them should be on here
4643997 pretty much did away with any possibility of that road ever coming through there they didnt want it to go through their campus
4643998 all the traffic coming from the interstate when leaving the werz area will have to come back out werz turn right and have to go find somewhere to make a turn
4643999 without that connection youre going to have a real mess
4644000 you told neighbors that four of the commissioners were supporting denial you shouldnt say things like that
4644001 i think so you said you couldnt talk to me about it
4644002 youve already got an empty save rite an empty chevron empty buildings up and down hwy 34
4644003 i will never sell that house weve had it up for sale forever now
4644004 all its going to do is just devalue the property
4644005 its enough to develop when you have all these empty buildings out here
4644006 whens it going to stop never until it goes all the way to meriwether county
4644007 how would you feel if it was beside your house
4644008 tatiana has good reasons to believe that having this business development built right next door to her would unfavorably alter the character of the neighborhood and her property
4644009 and dramatically lower the property value and precipitate a decline in the property values in manchester
4644010 it is an intrusion into the privacy and the solitude a person should be able to expect when they buy a home in a residential subdivision
4644011 all of her work and earned money is tied up in that house
4644012 will force tatiana to sell her house at a great loss no one will want to buy her house with a large commercial development right next door
4644013 it should not be allowed at the expense of tatiana and the other residents of the manchester subdivision
4644014 we have worked diligently with the county planning staff to come up with an agreeable solution that meets what we want to achieve and what the county is looking for
4644015 we feel like this is a vested rights case pretty plain and simple
4644016 it looks like some of the impact fees may be going to stuff that is not necessarily going to be done or needs to be done or is really specifically earmarked for what is necessary for additional development
4644017 obviously we dont want to get into attacking that ordinance and the whole thing because that would just be a waste of everybodys time effort and money
4644018 i think that is an issue youve got to consider
4644019 heard what god was doing in saskatchewan in that little church
4644020 the number one question especially christian college students were asking was how can i know the will of god and how can i do the will of god
4644021 would you be willing to put that into a course
4644022 we had no idea what god was going to do with it
4644023 has sold more than five million copies and is translated into more than 70 languages
4644024 experiencing the cross your greatest opportunity for victory over sin
4644025 i think god puts a spiritual dna into every person where theyre restless until they know the will of god
4644026 gods people become enamored with the world and the ways of the world
4644027 thats why americas going to hell thats why were going down because gods people are continuing to live without experiencing god
4644028 some aspect of the nature of god they were missing
4644029 one of the tragedies of our day is too many pastors have lost the shepherds heart we need to lead and bring back those who are missing
4644030 i cant see a pastor taking seriously the call of god and then staying somewhere a year and a half the shepherd doesnt abandon the sheep
4644031 if ive been somewhere i have a stewardship of that
4644032 the nation doesnt need more of what weve been doing
4644033 we never connect how were living with what we say we believe
4644034 as goes the people of god so goes the redemption of the rest of the world as goes gods people so goes the nation and so goes the rest of the world
4644035 it is the poor and disadvantaged who suffer disproportionately from judicial corruption due to their marginalized status and inability to pay bribes
4644036 it is therefore crucial that the transparency of the judiciary be continuously scrutinized and when found to be lacking enforced with particular momentum in order to prevent the weakest sections of the society to bear the costs of corruption in the judicial system
4644037 the recognition that an independent judiciary is the prerequisite for rule of law is to be found in nearly all major human rights conventions

4644040 beyond the commons investigating the value of personalizing web search
4644041 web queries are very short and it is unlikely that a two or three word query can unambiguously describe a users informational goal
4644042 did they leave the faucets on all day did they turn the water on and forget about it

4644046 theres a huge lake of water on the back of the road and its a very dangerous situation
4644047 were afraid the going to flood going to move and come out and crush right down over gambo we have all the houses evacuated under the road

4644085 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4644086 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4644147 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4644245 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4644246 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4644247 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4644248 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4644249 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4644250 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4644251 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4644252 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4644253 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4644254 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4644255 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4644256 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4644257 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4644258 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4644259 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4644260 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4644261 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4644262 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4644263 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4644264 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region

4644281 i understand theres going to be a level of excitement which is great

4644288 we have received numerous complaints and a lot of organizations are threatening to sue us
4644289 said jessica blake sinless touch vice president of corporate communications
4644290 we knew that our charity program will raise a lot of eyebrows but what the people dont see is that were not different from the other industries we will never waver in our commitment just because people view it differently
4644291 it is astounding that there are still people who believe men have one less rib than women
4644292 there must be at least one male in your life whose chest youre allowed to touch please count his ribs count your ribs compare
4644293 but as soon as one attempts to count them or view them the diety uses their supreme magic and replaces the missing rib

4644298 muitos atravessam as avenidas em locais sem faixas adequadas em vez de usarem a passarela apenas 100 metros adiante
4644299 i really love you but i am not in love with your alter ego
4644300 sorry im not who you think i am i know i look like someone you know i get that a lot
4644301 its none of your business go grab us some beers
4644302 you can tell me you are the bread winner after all
4644303 you think you need one because from here it doesnt look like you do
4644304 theyre already a full b i want a full c just an enhancement
4644305 see boys her and i have already discussed it shes a little whore shes said time and time again shed do anything shes not even wearing any panties and of course shes soaking wet
4644306 i dont know about you guys but i think we could find a much more fun way to spend this 4500
4644307 after all with a little negotiating it might turn out to be an investment
4644308 im definitely with you on that you sure you dont mind rob
4644309 you said youd do anything and im not buying them for you so if you want them work for them i know about your little fantasies
4644310 the other day i came home early and thought i heard moaning i thought this horny little bitch finally cheated on me i peaked through the window like any red blooded man would do and there was my precious little wife humping a pillow
4644311 just grinding her clit into the silk pillowcase like a bitch in heat
4644312 well i dont know about you guys but if we have a true freak on our hands and were spending 4500 i want a show
4644313 yeah i dont know you guys do you know what you can get a couple of whores to do for that kind of money i doubt she is half as freaky as i want her to be
4644314 she will do whatever you ask of her im sure
4644315 like i said for 4500 i want a show you little whore
4644316 i told you no by the way let me know if i get out of line rob
4644317 no man whats mine is yours she obviously needs it youre probably more experienced at the whole training thing anyway
4644318 did you hear that guys begging me to fuck her oh rob you should have gotten me involved a long time ago shes out of control
4644319 i have all night to fuck you bitch first i want to play what should we play guys
4644320 i want to see her straddle the arm of the couch and fuck herself
4644321 i want to see if shes really the whore we think she is
4644322 by the way i think shes definitely even more of a whore than we ever could have imagined that slut likes to suck dick and i can tell shes not new at it if you know what i mean
4644323 i hope you understand that 4500 goes a far way as far as sex goes you probably cant comprehend the things a hooker would do for that price and thats basically what you are right now
4644324 well what a good girl you are here climb up on the table
4644325 i like the sir thing but what if i want to play
4644326 i want you to stick your finger in my asshole
4644327 rub that cum into yourself show us what a dirty little whore you are and how much you like getting cum baths
4644328 you know once you get the tits were going to do this more often right
4644329 and was subject to abuse because of his sexual orientation
4644330 that unlike lott he didnt explore the possibility that gun storage laws actually cause crime
4644331 but his regressions would have shown an increase if they had
4644332 lott claims that his own paper that found that safe storage laws increase crime is the only academic research on the subject even though he is well aware of other academic research that comes to a different conclusion
4644333 but his regressions would have shown an increase if they had
4644334 lott claims that his own paper that found that safe storage laws increase crime is the only academic research on the subject even though he is well aware of other academic research that comes to a different conclusion
4644335 this discussion is about trigger locks and safe storage neither of them would have changed the outcome of this story
4644336 a history of violent crime or of paranoid mental disorders should mitigate against gun ownership for that person
4644337 a guy who runs amok with a knife in a school can probably be brought down before he kills more than one or two victims
4644338 the same could be done very easily for guns what is the difference
4644339 nice society you have there be a shame if it got broken
4644340 i only belittled the death of 80 children in terms of 5000 other children i think that is fair i think the millions of dollars spent to push gun control could do far more good spent elsewhere and the gun control supporters are belittling the 5000 in favor of the 80 simply because they have an irrational hatred of firearms
4644341 im sure that ben feels that laws targeting the minority of pedophiles who use the internet to find their victims are a waste of money and
4644342 or could it be that someone spent a lot more money preventing the laws no surely not
4644343 sorry werent we talking about the safe storage laws which have been passed
4644344 also since when does a libertarian complain about how people voluntarily spend their own money
4644345 or could it be that someone spent a lot more money preventing the laws no surely not
4644346 so ben youre against waiting periods you think its a good idea to sell a gun to someone who storms in after an argument with a wife or a co worker and asks for a 38 and one speedloader full of bullets
4644347 against registration and licensing are you against registration and licensing of cars and drivers too if not why not
4644348 should violent psychotics be allowed to own guns people convicted of rape or homicide
4644349 did he have a right to buy guns and ammunition would a law preventing him from doing so have been morally wrong
4644350 against registration and licensing are you against registration and licensing of cars and drivers too if not why not
4644351 should violent psychotics be allowed to own guns people convicted of rape or homicide
4644352 did he have a right to buy guns and ammunition would a law preventing him from doing so have been morally wrong
4644353 so im still waiting to hear rough odds that an average person in an average town will require a gun to defend myself from harm and in fact successfully use the gun to defend themselves
4644354 it is slightly hard to keep you somewhere near the topic ben
4644355 the gun control movement is funded by big outfits like the joyce foundation the gun rights movement is primarily funded by individuals where do you think the nra gets all its money
4644356 oh you mean a criminal will stop doing whatever evil they are involved in if you point a locked gun at them may as well just point your finger at them in that case pow pow
4644357 so logically there should be an increase in the crime rate in the states which passed safe storage laws got any evidence for that
4644358 what else would an armor piercing bullet be used for
4644359 ompus check out the dgu in the archives here then number of people saved by dgu is very small
4644360 the number saved in the us is approximately 160 year much much less than number of gun homicides
4644361 according to wright and rossis study the main reason criminals acquire guns is
4644362 65 000 is the number of violent crimes prevented by guns
4644363 if you think your murder problem isnt a gun problem but a culture problem doesnt that mean you agree with michael moore
4644364 what do you think michael moores explanation is what is yours how do they contrast
4644365 and about europe well take finland for example if you look only at caucasians in the us the homicide rate in the us is about the same as finland and about 50 higher than canada italy and the rest
4644366 yeah and if you exclude the poorest 10 of the population in those countries what does that do to your comparison
4644367 providing firearms training and encouraging interest in the shooting sports
4644368 providing firearms training and encouraging interest in the shooting sports
4644369 and gun safety and skill and hunting safety were its focus for most of its history
4644370 ben has kinda sorta almost stumbled upon one of the key reasons why its so hard to get handgun control in the us most of the victims of gun violence are black
4644371 in fact you could turn around that old shibboleth of the american right
4644372 there are lots of countries out there with much lower gun death rates than the us and they all have more gun control
4644373 do you remember the virginia tech massacre do you think the shooter should have been allowed to buy guns and ammo given his history of mental illness and violent conduct yes or no
4644374 hmm my state just passed stricter gun control laws now my murderous rage has gone away and i will give up what i wanted to do
4644375 most people probably dont know for example that the nra helped pass the laws in the 1930s that made sawed off shotguns illegal
4644376 yes but many have higher rates of murder and higher rates of suicide their stabbing deaths are over the top compared to americas
4644377 reducing the us murder rate to the level of finland never mind the level of australia or the uk would save around 8 700 lives per year
4644378 and finally not matter the cost we will not cede our liberty to the government
4644379 no price is too great for someone else to pay for freedom
4644380 there are lots of countries out there with much lower gun death rates than the us and they all have more gun control
4644381 nice society you have there be a shame if it got broken
4644382 all rights not enumerated here rest with the states or the people
4644383 i think that should be restricted pause there are wackos out there yknow
4644384 so youre saying that such a government would nuke itself in trying to subdue its populace that is absurd
4644385 attention to emancipated black people it is therefore to be hoped will become a branch of our national policy but as far as we contribute to promote this emancipation so far that attention is evidently a serious duty incumbent on us and which we mean to discharge to the best of our judgment and abilities to instruct to advise to qualify those who have been restored to freedom for the exercise and enjoyment of civil liberty to promote in them habits of industry to furnish them with employments suited to their age sex talents and other circumstances and to procure their children an education calculated for their future situation in life these are the great outlines of the annexed plan which we have adopted and which we conceive will essentially promote the public good and the happiness of these our hitherto too much neglected fellow creatures
4644386 also of course it could be that the murder rate is independent of the gun ownership rate because there are so many guns in the us
4644387 no they sucked they were frequently populated by immigrants who did not fit in culturally were poor and had little other place to go but they had incentive to leave it typically took three generations or so but they eventually integrated into society and moved on up hard as it was
4644388 the new immigrants were uniformly discriminated against and rightly so
4644389 taxes in canada are 3x higher than in the us
4644390 i do not prejudice is one thing but discrimination is another all together
4644391 did you know that according to thomas sowell that americans who start out in the bottom 10 of income earners have a better chance of ending up in the top 10 of income earners than they do of staying in the bottom 10 thats fairly interesting
4644392 an example where people of highly similar cultures but vastly different gun ownership rates showed effectively no difference in homicide rates
4644393 labor services are something employers can buy if you raise the price of those services how will it affect how much they buy a theyll buy more b theyll buy the same amount c theyll buy less the numerical answer is left as an exercise for the student
4644394 labor services are something employers can buy if you raise the price of those services how will it affect how much they buy
4644395 teenage unemployment is very positively correlated to the minimum wage and the minimum wage granger causes it
4644396 thats from free to choose 1980 i think ill take miltons word over yours ian

4644400 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4644401 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them

4644405 the man sitting next to member of knesset yohanan bader
4644406 there is no doubt in my mind that very soon the government of israel is going to have to address the demographic issue with the utmost seriousness and resolve this issue above all others will dictate the solution that we must adopt
4644407 to maximize the number of jews to minimize the number of palestinians not to withdraw to the 1967 border and not to divide jerusalem
4644408 this is the best government we ever had in terms of the prospects for peace with the palestinians
4644409 we are closer than ever to concrete understandings that will likely serve as a basis for agreements in our dialogues with both the palestinians and the syrians
4644410 as long as i remain at my post i will not stop trying to continue to bring the negotiations between us and our neighbors to a successful conclusion that embodies hope
4644411 la debilidad del terreno y la falta de un estudio geol gico en profundidad fueron los principales motivos que llevaron a la empresa encargada a retrasar las actuaciones ya que no se contaba con el riesgo de desprendimientos de conos volc nicos
4644412 sin esta definici n de las competencias de cada instituci n el t nel no se va a poder abrir en los plazos establecidos que era entre septiembre y octubre
4644413 el t nel necesita una serie de detalles para estar operativo como el suministro de energ a el ctrica para que est perfectamente dotado para la seguridad vial tarea que corresponde a la consejer a de industria del gobierno de canarias
4644414 el despliegue de nuevas fuerzas de defensa antimisil en europa tiene como objetivo a la federaci n de rusia y han elegido para ello el momento adecuado
4644415 cada competencia debe ir a la administraci n que sea capaz de ejercerla con mejores garant as por su proximidad al ciudadano
4644416 cuanto m s recursos reciba canarias m s podr distribuir entre los canarios a trav s de los ayuntamientos y de los cabildos en funci n de sus competencias
4644417 los ayuntamientos se quejan con raz n porque les faltan recursos para atender las competencias a su vez los cabildos se quejan del gobierno de canarias porque tambi n les faltan recursos para atender algunas de las competencias transferidas y finalmente el gobierno de canarias se queja de que no tiene los recursos necesarios
4644418 no puede ser visto desde el punto de vista partidario
4644419 en estos momentos una gran parte de la financiaci n de la comunidad aut noma para atender los servicios esenciales depende de los fondos que se transfieren desde el estado
4644420 el gobierno de espa a ha estado enga ando a los espa oles
4644421 est clar simo que un territorio alejado del continente necesita m s medidas
4644422 si hay una sola comunidad aut noma en el estado espa ol que tenga la necesidad imperiosa de mejorar la gesti n de sus infraestructuras aeroportuarias es canarias
4644423 son instrumentos vitales para nuestro desarrollo social y econ mico de canarias
4644424 a canarias hay que entenderla como una gran plataforma aeroportuaria
4644425 habr que valorar si tambi n los ayuntamientos donde est n implantadas estas infraestructuras
4644426 no nos sirven las promesas de la ministra de fomento

4644459 cu les son los factores que alimentan el sue o del amor eterno con la misma persona
4644460 la supervivencia est ligada a la reproducci n de la especie
4644461 la exclusividad del sentimiento amoroso es un ardid de la evoluci n para aumentar las posibilidades de supervivencia de los humanos

4644464 estamos condicionados para pensar que es la nica forma de vivir nuestros amores
4644465 s lo se da en una sociedad que proscribe los amores plurales
4644466 el adulterio es el reverso de la moneda de la exclusividad amorosa
4644467 no se trata de abolir el matrimonio mon gamo pues ciertas personas se encuentran bien en l
4644468 aquellos que lo deseen sean autorizados a vivir p blicamente sus amores plurales
4644469 est establecida como sistema social en el que no todos tienen los mismos derechos pues se favorece a un g nero mayoritariamente al hombre
4644470 ampliar la vida sexual al incorporar otras personas sin que exista ning n tipo de relaci n sentimental con ellas
4644471 tener conciencia de que no se es todo para otra persona

4644474 we are aware of criticism and that there has been talk of the hip to waist ratio but this is the agreed system and we will continue to use it
4644475 to get to the weight slap in the middle of what the index says is right for a man of my height i would have to lose around five stone thats madness id look ill and as if i had a massive head
4644476 i eat one big meal a day it is a really big meal maybe a whole chicken rice and peas i think the amount i eat and my diet is good there is a problem with weight in this country but the index is confusing it doesnt take into account things like muscle
4644477 that classification isnt any good because it doesnt take into account my body frame muscle or what sex i am all of which make a difference
4644478 id have to lose around three stone for the government to think im the right weight thats just stupid id look ill and i probably would be ill
4644479 i know the government has to have a way to measure weight but this is not it they need to look at things again
4644480 the bmi doesnt take into account things like muscle which is important it would class most rugby players and footballers as obese and look how fit they are
4644481 according to the index my healthy weight is around 12 to 13 stone but i actually think that is underweight for my height
4644482 there is a problem with obesity in this country people dont eat well or look after themselves but using the bmi is not the right way of assessing the problem its not very helpful
4644483 im big boned but the index doesnt take that into account and it should i do drive a cab which means im sitting on my bum all day but i wouldnt say i was unhealthy
4644484 i have lost weight in recent months i did it by eating healthily my wife does all that stuff salads and that she looks after me very well
4644485 the bmi is not a helpful way of calculating whos overweight and not the problem is if people dont trust it theyre not going to trust what else the government says about being healthy
4644486 id have to lose about two stone to get to what the government thinks is the ideal weight for me its ridiculous i would look ill look like a skeleton i would not look healthy
4644487 i know there are some things about my eating habits that i could change but on the whole i dont consider myself unhealthy
4644488 id like to see what some of those government ministers are classed as using this index i would like to see how they react to being called fat
4644489 id have to lose two stone i would look ill look like a skeleton
4644490 en nuestros propios gustos musicales no nos gusta etiquetarnos o ubicarnos nicamente en un g nero o estilo nos movemos entre el rock metal y el folk pero tenemos un mont n de registros
4644491 la verdad hemos tenido mucha suerte al fin hemos conseguido que todos los miembros de la banda componemos todos nuestros temas y todos participamos en ese proceso tenemos una visi n musical bastante positiva

4644512 well x y and z arent important enough so they can go
4644513 hm while everything here is important to me in a way items a b and c are really the most important
4644514 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4644515 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4644516 that will drive the property value down theres a lot of financial implications for the city
4644517 there are a lot of people crying out for work i think we should do whatever we can to help them
4644518 and that wouldnt be right for the people that work there if they want to unionize obviously theres something not going well with management but as far as professional ethics go these people have rights and they should be voiced
4644519 ethiopian convoys opened fire into different areas where thousands of displaced people were living they killed everyone on the road
4644520 every great project needs to transform itself in order to excel and today we are starting that process
4644521 i figure if im ever gonna do this this is the day to do this
4644522 if it is something that is going to give women better protection then we should see if that is something we can get hold of
4644523 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4644524 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4644525 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4644526 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4644527 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4644528 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4644529 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4644530 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4644531 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4644532 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4644533 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4644534 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4644535 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4644536 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4644537 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4644538 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4644539 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4644540 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4644541 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4644542 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4644543 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4644544 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4644545 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4644546 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4644547 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4644548 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4644549 this is a planning took where all things are going
4644550 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4644551 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4644552 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4644553 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4644554 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4644555 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4644556 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4644557 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4644558 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4644559 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4644560 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4644561 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4644562 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4644563 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4644564 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4644565 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4644566 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4644567 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4644568 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4644569 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4644570 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4644571 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4644572 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4644573 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4644574 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4644575 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4644576 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4644577 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4644578 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4644579 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4644580 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4644581 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4644582 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4644583 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4644584 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4644585 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4644586 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4644587 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4644588 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4644589 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4644590 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4644591 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4644592 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4644593 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4644594 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4644595 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4644596 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4644597 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4644598 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4644599 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4644600 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4644601 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4644602 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4644603 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4644604 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4644605 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4644606 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4644607 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4644608 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4644609 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4644610 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4644611 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4644612 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4644613 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4644614 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4644615 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4644616 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4644617 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4644618 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4644619 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4644620 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4644621 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4644622 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4644623 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4644624 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4644625 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4644626 weve all also worked carefully in crafting the principles implementation guidelines and accountability and learning framework to be sure this isnt a code pointing at or strictly about china
4644627 while it is true that here we are concerned with financial dependency and not emotional dependence the whole relationship between the appellant and the deceased must be examined
4644628 dependent in the ordinary sense of the word means the condition of depending on something or on someone for what is needed
4644629 surely a mothers services to a young child satisfy the test the child could not survive without the provision of those services he or she needs them to suggest that in a money sense they are valueless is simply wrong
4644630 the same considerations apply to a step child or his or her step mother when the child lives with the step mother and is looked after by her i appreciate that a different view has been taken by others as for example by powell j in dunn v public trustee powell j 1 june 1989 unreported but i would respectfully disagree with that view in my opinion the plaintiff was partly dependent upon the deceased certainly for many years of her childhood and probably until her marriage although no doubt her dependence diminished in the latter years of this period
4644631 graduation prom everybody wants to see the senior year so its gonna
4644632 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4644633 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4644634 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4644635 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4644636 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4644637 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4644638 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4644639 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4644640 i hate to be fair to the obama campaign but it is remarkable that we have two presidential candidates who are proposing mandatory plans to reduce americas carbon emissions
4644641 the lesson from the european experience is that you dont want to give away permits you should move immediately to a marketdetermined price for carbon
4644642 you should aim for as much predictability and reliability as possible in terms of the number of permits and you should ensure the carbon caps are as comprehensive as possible mccain meets none of these criteria
4644643 setting up a cap and trade system is a strong priority for senator mccain that he is committed to pursuing early into his first term
4644644 he has been committed for many years to achieving this goal
4644645 we are completely opposed to setting up a us system of cap and trade until you have a treaty that includes china and india
4644646 even then we dont believe in imposing mandatory targets we would continue to lobby against it whoever is putting it forward
4644647 people point at me but cavic is looking good and itll be a tight race
4644648 i just ran the first 50 metres and then i looked round to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4644649 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4644650 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4644651 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4644652 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4644653 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4644654 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4644655 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4644656 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4644657 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4644658 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4644659 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4644660 xbox 360 hardware sales were again lighter than we expected indicating that microsoft may be experiencing stagnant demand the company cut the price of its xbox 360 pro 20gb by 50 to 299 in july but demand remained fairly flat we do not expect a significant bump in august with the release of the new pro 60gb at 349 we expect microsoft to reconsider its pricing strategy especially if sales of the xbox 360 continue to lag sales of the ps3
4644661 underlying software sales strength along with increased hardware supply position the industry for continued strong sales through 2008
4644662 they should call it the limestone monster instead of the green monster

4644664 the play concerns a team of men don teach bob and fletcher who does not appear in the play but is referred to who are conspiring to steal a coin collection from a wealthy man don who owns a junk shop sold a nickel to a man for much less than what it was worth out of revenge he and his friend in training bob plan to steal the mans coin collection after suspecting that he went away for the weekend
4644665 only about 30 to 50 years worth of oil left at present rates of consumption
4644666 whether were talking about crude oil natural gas or coal the trend is the same every year were paying more and expending more effort for less and less energy
4644667 if you reach out your arms and form a t and your wingspan is longer than your height you can be at risk
4644668 in my case those measurements have always been very close
4644669 i didnt know at the time why the doctor decided to look into this my mom and bob didnt want me to freak out so they told me that it was simply a good idea for young athletes to have an ekg electrocardiogram test in order to look at the heart
4644670 it was his ears then he had very long arms then he would catch up somewhere else
4644671 i have been tested once a year ever since at baltimore hospital johns hopkins under the direction of dr peter roe and the tissues are strong the aortic route is clear and my heart is in good shape as long as my baltimore ravens are winning

4644721 it is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there
4644722 the state of the world calls out for poetry to save it
4644723 your poems must be more than want ads for broken hearts
4644724 dont cater to the middle mind of america nor to consumer society
4644725 dig folksingers who are the true singing poets of yesterday and today
4644726 make permanent waves and not just on the heads of stylish women
4644727 life lived with poetry in mind is itself an art
4644728 it is a pulsing fragment of the inner life an un tethered music
4644729 it was an experience i will remember for a lifetime
4644730 everybody talks about it and it does live up to the expectations
4644731 just entering that new stadium the best stadium ive ever been to in my life 90 000 people watching you walk around and the spectacle is something i will remember for the rest of my life
4644732 i still get a sick feeling in my stomach thinking about how close we were to advancing one minute away from victory in a 2 2 tie against the netherlands and then a red card early in the nigeria game
4644733 its frustrating because i know we had such a good team and could have done some good things in the tournament
4644734 against real the goal is to try to get to first and then you go from there
4644735 if we win we go to the top which would be an achievement because it has been a slow grind for us
4644736 obviously it was a great experience but our focus is now on mls i dont know what my role will be against rsl but whatever it is i am 100 percent committed and looking to help the team get back to the top of the west
4644737 we played in some great stadiums against some great teams

4644748 it is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and we certainly see that in play here but at another level it is somewhat annoying when you see the over the top rhetoric they utilize and at some level you get mad
4644749 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4644750 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4644751 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4644752 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
4644753 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
4644754 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
4644755 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
4644756 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
4644757 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better

4644791 an iraqi infantry division was expected to control a security zone along the front about 8 km deep most of the divisions combat force was concentrated in an operational zone about 10 km deep the divisional logistic and administrative area was concentrated in a more secure zone 2 km deep to the rear of the operational zone
4644792 a clearly visible terrain feature with reasonable trafficability it offered a good attack route both to the iraqis and to the coalition forces the iraqis not only located infantry units on the sides of the wadi as flanking forces but also placed two armored and one mechanized republican guard divisions and two armored army divisions just north of the point where the wadi opened up into flat desert they were expected to be able to stop any attack up the wadi al batin and would also serve as a theater reserve if the attack came elsewhere however the iraqis did not anticipate a major attack in this area or further west the terrain just west of the wadi they considered unsuitable for tanks since there were lots of boulders and sabkhas of quicksand moreover there were no roads in this area and the iraqis firmly believed that units trying to operate away from roads in the desert would simply get lost

4644802 as long as it is not over the part we are in that is absolutely no problem so we will let the helicopters fly that is a very important point and i want to make it sure that its recorded that military helicopters can fly over iraq

4644864 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
4644865 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
4644866 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
4644867 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed

4644966 ooh gooddy send me gt to the twilight zone again
4644967 my wife and i have prayed that if our children did something they were not supposed to do they would get caught
4644968 well the lord answers prayers and our son was caught
4644969 all right i admit it i also accessed the democratic national committee site my mind filled with liberalism and i gave all my lunch money to a homeless man
4644970 but he was always such a quiet and polite boy
4644971 wait you trotted out your own son in this very column talking about how he accessed porn on america online
4644972 if this father believes this is a way to correct his sons behavior he has a very distorted view of caring and loving parenting
4644973 this public humiliation is very likely to either induce tremendous rage
4644974 and or dramatically impact his self esteem and self concept in a negative direction something he will undoubtedly remember for life
4644975 or youd have to kill me to get me in front of that camera
4644976 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4644977 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4644978 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4644979 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4644980 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4644981 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4644982 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4644983 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4644984 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4644985 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4644986 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4644987 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4644988 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4645035 sebahagian ulama mengatakan bahawa aurat lelaki itu hanyalah dua kemaluannya sahaja qubul dan dubur manakala sebahagian ulama pula mengatakan aurat lelaki itu dari pusat ke lutut di sisi kami ibnu al arabi hanyalah dua kemaluannya sahaja yang dikira aurat yang hakiki iaitu anggota anggota manusia yang dicaci dibenci dan dianggap buruk melihatnya dua kemaluan itu adalah tempat kepada apa yang kami sebutkan itu adalah menepati hukum haram anggota anggota selain daripada dua kemaluan itu dari pusat ke atas dan dari lutut ke bawah adalah menepati hukum syubhat yang sepatutnya berjaga jaga kerana berternak di sempadan kawasan larangan itu hampir hampir termasuk ke dalamnya
4645036 sebahagian ulama mengatakan keseluruhan tubuh perempuan aurat kecuali muka dan dua tapak tangan ada pula ulama yang mengatakan demikian dengan tambahan tapak kakinya tidak termasuk aurat
4645037 para ulama keseluruhannya telah ittifak sepakat mengatakan bahawa menutup aurat itu suatu kewajipan yang mutlak tetapi mereka berselisih faham tentang penutupan itu adakah ia merupakan suatu syarat yang terkandung di dalam beberapa syarat bagi sah sembahyang ataupun tidak
4645038 aurat terbahagi kepada dua bahagian aurat mughallazah aurat berat dan aurat mukhaffah aurat ringan aurat mughallazah itu adalah qubul dan dubur dan aurat mukhaffah iaitu anggota anggota selain daripada apa yang telah disebut ia daripada aurat

4645051 combining free tools from google technorati yahoo and other providers offers useful information but it is the analysis and interpretation of this data that is the valuable element and this takes time we are at the tipping point where for most large brands using free tools is no longer an option

4645091 this is the webmaster you know the person who controls the information that is put on your indiana government website
4645092 i had talked to someone from your office who said you have come up with a solution to hiding correcting the information that is contained on the department of workforce development warn notice page
4645093 you know those pesky figures are out there for everyone to see
4645094 what if people start adding those black and white numbers up and realize the workers are in worse shape than what your commercials say
4645095 well webmaster i gathered my trusty advisers around me and i think we came up with a pretty darn good idea
4645096 first let me make this clear much as i would like to get rid of the information all together i cant just tell someone to take that damaging information off the website
4645097 but heres what we can do to make it really difficult for people to keep track of the notices
4645098 all they want to do is rain on my parade
4645099 you sound different like you have a twang in your voice or something
4645100 i know we cant take the information off the page but technically we only have to list the active warn notices
4645101 so heh heh well just remove all those dozens and dozens of expired notices
4645102 no point in keeping those on and reminding everybody just how many jobs have been lost
4645103 the only notices that have to stay are active ones
4645104 see if we calendar those notices that are expiring and get them off there the moment theyre done we can hide remove them as soon as they expire
4645105 i have to admit i dont know why we didnt think of this before
4645106 i mean just think of all those notices from last year showing the thousands and thousands of jobs we lost just staring everyone in the face

4645112 quando a warner bros decidiu adiar harry potter e o enigma do pr ncipe para o ver o de 2009 vimos uma excelente oportunidade para colocar o nosso filme no seu lugar h qual est conquistando uma grande expectativa e est tendo o seu grande momento durante os ltimos meses

4645115 we saw a lot of evidence for what some political scientists call the racial threat hypothesis that is an attempt to try to explain why is it that obama does so well in virginia and does really well in mississippi and new york but does much less well in a place like tennessee or less well in texas
4645116 there are fewer african americans as a percentage of population in virginia than in tennessee or texas so people in virginia are much less threatened by the racial issue its not as salient for them and therefore not as vital a cue for them in evaluating candidates its in places more like texas that have enough african americans such that the majority group feels somehow threatened and its in those areas where race is a much more salient cue for peoples evaluations in everyday life so people in those places were much more likely to view obama negatively and then vote for hillary clinton
4645117 where youre going to see it in november is in the southern states the question is is virginia a southern state its sort of a rim state a border state so is virginia more like other border states where you might see this take place i tend to say no but obamas only up by a point in the polls in virginia right now and it wouldnt take much of a race gap in a plus one or plus two situation to turn virginia
4645118 virginia is a different place today than it was 20 years ago

4645154 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have for a lot longer than just turning off the rest to use up the 57 million and go back to the original source
4645155 those 57 million barrels are not used only in virginia of course as i think you mention here they are sold on the worldwide market i cant imagine that they have even a half penny effect on oil prices on the global market and that would be assuming that they were all available at once which they would not be i offered that comparison about how many days it would take the u s to blow through that amount of oil to offer perspective on how relatively small that cache is

4645163 cadillac is a natural fit for gms next step in developing the e flex platform
4645164 cadillac at its very essence is about premium luxury design and technology so its fitting that cadillac would be propelled by the most elegant solution this signals cadillacs intent to lead the industry with alternative fuel technology
4645165 this is a vision of what comes next a fuel cell electric vehicle that delivers the driving characteristics cadillac customers want and allowing them to do it without using a single drop of petroleum while emitting only water vapor
4645166 this is proof that alternate fuels and advanced technologies create even greater opportunities to satisfy the luxury buyer
4645167 all the people and cargo carrying capability customers expect in crossovers and suvs is available in the provoq along with the premium attributes expected in a cadillac
4645168 from the strong shield grille and vertical headlamps to the crisp body lines the provoq is instantly recognizable as a contemporary cadillac
4645169 like the new cts it is bold and expressive but there is enhanced shape between the edges its a new proportion for crossovers with a fast almost coupe like rear
4645170 everything about the vehicle reinforces the notion that great style and environmentally conscious transportation can go hand in hand
4645171 we didnt sacrifice proportion stance or cadillacs iconic design cues we used them to support the efficiency of the vehicle
4645172 the adaptability of the e flex architecture enabled the designers to create a great looking vehicle regardless of its alternative fuel powertrain
4645173 the ports are functional but rather than hide them they are design elements of the provoq
4645174 sweeping body lines that culminate at the top and bottom edges of the ports suggest forward thrust even when the vehicle is stationary
4645175 the interior is roomy well equipped and offers the space people want in a crossover
4645176 there are no compromises inside the provoq to accommodate the fuel cell powertrain and fuel tanks a factor that proves the technology and real world feasibility are growing closer together
4645177 it picks up the cues refinement and attention to detail of the new cts and takes them to the next level
4645178 a contrasting color scheme extensive use of ambient lighting technology and elements such as cut and sewn hand wrapped leather with french seams are elements seen in current cadillac models but they are amplified in the provoq

4645308 they dont have to be trucked from far away nor are they coming from a factory where theyre kept in small cages or dosed with all kinds of antibiotics

4645325 we are hoping for a positive issue because if not there are a lot of things that can come out into the open and have very bad consequences for the bulldogs and nrl
4645326 the bulldogs have been honest open and transparent in these discussions with sonny bill williams and his management
4645327 its not ideal but the big issue for us was obtaining the injunction and the fact that he complied with it by not playing then entering into negotiations with the bulldogs

4645380 we hope in allah most high to whom be praise who leads the hearts of muslims to calm what torments them and ruins their prosperity
4645381 where is the sense of honor of muslims the pride of believers the zeal of the faithful
4645382 we shall never cease to be amazed at how the disbelievers for their part have shown trusts and it is the muslims who have been lacking in zeal
4645383 the muslims on the other hand are weak and demoralized they have become negligent and lazy the victims of unproductive stupefaction and completely lacking in enthusiasm
4645384 this is the moment to cast off laziness to summon from far and near all those men who have blood in their veins but we are confident

4645394 o ab qud mah tell us about the most amazing thing you have witnessed while in jih d
4645395 o ab qud mah i was listening to what you mentioned about jih d and your incitement for muslims to join it i have been blessed with more hair than many other women i have cut it and made a horses rein out of and i have covered it with dust so that no one can recognise it i wish that you take it with you so that when you arrive to the land of the disbelievers and the horsemen engage in battle the arrows are fired the swords are drawn and the spears are pulled out either use it if you find the need for it or hand it to whoever needs it for i wish that my hair will witness the battle and will get the dust in the way of all h i am a widowed woman who had a husband and a number of relatives who were all killed in all hs path i would have joined jih d had it been required of me
4645396 o ab qud mah know that my husband left me a son who is amongst the finest of youths he has learnt the quran the art of swordsmanship as well as archery he prays at night and fasts during the day and he is 15 years of age he is currently away at a property which he has inherited from his father hopefully he will get back before your departure for i wish to send him with you as a gift to all h the exaltand most high and i ask you by all h that you do not deprive me from gaining the rewards i seek
4645397 o ab qud mah wait for me for a while may all h have mercy on you
4645398 praised be all h who did not deny me from your company and did not turn me back disappointed
4645399 my beloved let me see your face for if it is imperative on someone of your age to fight i would command you to join us otherwise i would turn you back
4645400 no in fact i am coming with you seeking revenge for my father who was martyred perhaps all h will grant me martyrdom as he granted my father
4645401 then go and ask her permission if she permits you to go then come back otherwise stay back with her
4645402 i am the son of the woman who gave you the trust how fast did you forget my mothers request i am insha all h the martyr son of the martyr i ask you by all h not to stop me from going forth with you in all hs way for i memorise all hs book and have knowledge of the prophets sunnah and i am experienced in horsemanship and shooting and i have not left behind someone who is a better fighter than myself so despise me not for my young age my mother has taken an oath that i should not come back and said o son if you meet the disbelievers turn not your back to them and offer your soul to all h and seek to be close to all h and the company of your father and your righteous uncles in the heaven and if all h grants you martyrdom then intercede on my behalf for i was told that the martyr can plead on behalf of seventy of his relatives and seventy of his neighbors she then hugged me lifted her head to the heavens and said my lord master and god this is my son the flower of my heart and the dearest to my soul i present him to you so draw him nearer to his father
4645403 i saw a vision which i liked and made me laugh
4645404 i saw myself in an elegant green garden while wandering in it i faced a silver castle which had balconies made of pearls and jewels its doors were made of gold and its curtains were lowered i then saw some maids whose faces were like the moons in beauty lifting the curtains upon seeing me they said welcome i then heard some of them saying to the others this is the husband of the mardhiyyah blessed they then said to me come forth may all h have mercy on you when i approached i saw a room on the top of the castle it was made of red gold and had a green bed made of jewels and its legs were made of white silver there was a girl on the bed whose face was like the sun and had it not been for all hs help i would have lost my sight and i would have lost my mind because of the brilliance of the room and the beauty of the girl upon seeing me the girl greeted me saying welcome o all hs servant and his beloved you are mine and i am yours i wanted to hug her but she said slow down do not rush you are not one of those who do wrong however we shall meet tomorrow at the time of zuhur prayers so rejoice
4645405 my beloved you saw but good and good it shall be insha all h

4645409 o uncle by the lord of the kabah my dream has come true i am the son of the reins owner
4645410 the likes of you cannot be forgotten you wipe my face with your gown my gown is worthier o uncle leave it for i wish to meet all h in this state o uncle the hoor girl of paradise that i described to you shes at my head waiting for my soul to depart from my body and she is saying to me hurry i am longing for you o uncle for the sake of all h if he was to bring you back safely take my blood stained clothes to my poor grieved and sad mother present them to her and tell her all h has accepted your gift
4645411 i bear witness that there is no god but all h no partner has he he has kept his promise and i bear witness that muhammad is all hs servant and messenger this is what all h and his messenger has promised us and all h and his messenger were true to their promise
4645412 did you come as a condoler or as a rejoicer
4645413 if my son has come back safe then you are indeed a condoler whereas if he has been killed in all hs path then you are a rejoicer
4645414 praise be to all h who spared him for me on the day of judgement
4645415 i also have a little sister and she almost died due to the news of my fathers death so keep my matter hidden to her and take this cloth as a sign as my mother would not believe if you do not show this to her

4645495 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4645562 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4645563 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4645566 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4645567 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4645568 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4645569 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4645570 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4645571 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4645572 how much is the life of a farm worker worth is it less than the life of any other human being
4645573 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of
4645574 mr fisk at the very beginning of the war in september of 1980 i was invited to go to the pentagon
4645575 there i was handed the very latest us satellite photographs of the iranian front lines you could see everything on the pictures there were the iranian gun emplacements in abadan and behind khorramshahr the lines of trenches on the eastern side of the karun river the tank revetments thousands of them all the way up the iranian side of the border towards kurdistan no army could want more than this and i traveled with these maps from washington by air to frankfurt and from frankfurt on iraqi airways straight to baghdad the iraqis were very very grateful
4645576 given to saddam by the us washington denied this but the iranians were right
4645577 i saw the results however on a long military hospital train back to tehran from the battle front i found hundreds of iranian soldiers coughing blood and mucus from their lungs the very carriages stank so much of gas that i had to open the windows and their arms and faces were covered with boils

4645613 intensified international pressures on iran have negatively affected economic activity
4645614 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4645615 the fact is that the iranian banks have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4645616 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks
4645617 has shown a great effort in preparing educational materials and his research in the domain of comparative law that has opened a new chapter not only in our university but to our knowledge in this country
4645618 has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
4645619 the interior ministry does not have the right to threaten the media for questioning the authenticity of the claim

4645629 i dont want to talk about what happened but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
4645630 i heard a big explosion and a vehicle in an ethiopian convoy exploded
4645631 ethiopian soldiers in the convoy started to shoot indiscriminately i ran away but when i came back half an hour later i saw 38 people had died and 16 injured
4645632 we wanted to reach mogadishus big hospital but we are unable to pass the streets because the road is closed
4645633 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4645634 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4645635 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right

4645639 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4645640 ive seen him up in the zone a lot more with everything and because of that his secondary stuff is not playing
4645641 well have to re evaluate him and see how we can get him going again
4645642 ya know jhonny i liked you so much better when you were just a ballplayer if you wanna be an interior decorator now thats none of my business but some of us still need this team now you listen to me this is my last shot at a winner and for some of the younger guys it could be their only shot i dont know what happened to you but if you ever ever tank another play like you did today im gonna cut your off and stuff em down your throat

4645652 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4645653 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4645654 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4645655 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4645656 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4645657 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4645658 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4645659 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here

4645673 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4645674 commodity prices have pulled down from their peaks and also their central banks are now cutting interest rates
4645675 with the rba reinforcing market expectations that they are likely to start lowering the official cash rate as soon as september we remain bearish
4645676 we continue to target a fall to 85 cents on this move
4645677 despite the presence of thousands of russian soldiers in the area

4645679 feels like some kind of ride but its turning out just to be life going absolutely perfectly
4645680 my stance and preference from draft day has been to sign with the yankees i am simply awaiting to find out from them if they wish to sign me
4645681 the only reason returning to school has even been discussed is simply if the yankees do not make me an offer
4645682 you can make these up to one week in advance
4645683 f ck you wrinkly old white haired man for trying to use me for your political purposes
4645684 im a big fan i love your work im absolutely certain
4645685 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4645686 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4645687 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4645688 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4645689 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4645690 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4645691 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4645692 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4645693 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in
4645694 a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by george w bush in this time of terror and war
4645695 too much of that stuffll kill you its oil that means its fat are you stupid
4645696 an olive oil rich diet is more effective than a low fat diet in controlling and treating obesity moreover it leads to longer lasting weight loss and it is easier to keep to because it tastes good
4645697 i think they are fabulous they are marvelous the best ive seen theyre great
4645698 they practiced everyday they played the games everyday and their true champions
4645699 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4645700 playing soft music in the cast room is a simple and inexpensive option for decreasing anxiety in young children during cast room procedures
4645701 these findings suggest strongly that exercise reduces the systemic inflammation that can lead to heart disease

4645705 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
4645706 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
4645707 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
4645708 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
4645709 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
4645710 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
4645711 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
4645712 we were confined to the community standard of just the city of staunton which only has like 22 000 people
4645713 and just outside of staunton there are video stores that have back rooms there are adult bookstores its only 30 miles from charlottesville its about 18 miles from harrisonburg and its just outside of waynesboro all of which have adult material available the judge wouldnt let us bring in anything that was from outside of the city we did a proffer of stuff that you could hit on the internet and what you could buy at these other stores its our understanding that there were two stores in town before this store opened that did have back rooms and then once the indictment came down against this store they pulled their adult dvds and of course we could never get the owner to call us back
4645714 based on the cases ive read he isnt an expert
4645715 we tried to introduce them but he turned down all of our comparables
4645716 he would not let us put in stores that were readily selling the tapes within 900 feet of the city line
4645717 its great to say to each his own but not when it destroys the morals and decency of a community
4645718 what happened in the summations is this prosecutor started with the children and the call to arms about take care of our community dont turn it into las vegas all this stuff all of which has traditionally been error and of course we moved for a mistrial
4645719 well see what the law is here in virginia the judge has given us 60 days to file our briefs but everywhere else a call to morality decency save our community save the children and all that other stuff has always been reversible error and so weve got all that in this case because he robertson said it all
4645720 they also attempted to shift the burden to us which is another error
4645721 because in their summation they said we challenge the defendants to prove that the material has serious scientific value well you cant shift the burden to us but they did with that statement and obviously we objected to it
4645722 theres one thing that was new that id never heard before you dont ejaculate you excrete semen
4645723 ive never heard that terminology before i thought when you came you ejaculated now whenever i ejaculate im going to think that im taking a piss or something the commonwealth attorney he would never say the word ejaculate he would say you excreted semen so i thought that was interesting and of course we got the typical unhealthy removal from the anus to the mouth and that kind of stuff
4645724 shes the one that believes watching this stuff sends out toxic impulses in your brain i wanted to wear aluminum shields around my head to stop the toxins from coming in i joked about it before we went over yesterday when we knew the movies were going to be played that maybe we should wear our tinfoil hats
4645725 the female has no pubic hair no breasts and an angular body type
4645726 typically this is someone whose body has not yet fully developed sexually in most industrialized countries this occurs at the age of 12
4645727 the commonwealth has tried to make this an underage case they have no proof and no good faith basis to allege that any one of these performers is underage and i move for a mistrial
4645728 that girl is clearly made to look like a child
4645729 this film does appeal to pedophiles pedophiles will buy this film and get off on it
4645730 youre saying shes like a child because she has small breasts i saw this movie every one of these women was shaved
4645731 i dont want to keep the jury here this long and get a mistrial i dont want to do it
4645732 because she started talking about that one of the actresses looked because she was small breasted and she was shaved that she started to say that she gave the appearance of like a 12 year old and all that and of course we objected and the judge was just livid and admonished the prosecutor there had been adamant pretrial determinations by the court that there would be absolutely no reference to children at all that that was not a part of this case at all they started to get some fringes with that he scolded them a couple of times and he was upset and if it had not been for the fact that we were already at the end of the third day of trial the jury was empanelled wed gone through most of the testimony he just was hell bent in a way not to grant a mistrial and he really admonished them
4645733 the other thing that was really interesting was that the governments position was that she should have been permitted to talk about prurient interest even though shes not from that community because prurient interest would be the same everywhere
4645734 thats not the position that weve been facing for the last 35 years where they say well you know unless theyre familiar with the contemporary community standards how do they know what appeals to the prurient interest here and weve been arguing for years whether you live in dallas or you live in jackson mississippi prurient is basically the same and now they the government were arguing that and they had a difficult time getting to that argument and she started to go off on that and the judge went wild and we moved for a mistrial we took a break and then she came back and her testimony was very short
4645735 we made an idiot out of their expert dr layden who wasnt credible at all
4645736 and in fact the jurors said they ignored her but they knocked out all of our comparable stuff we proffered it into the record but of course the jury never got to see it
4645737 weve asked the judge to not impose the judgment of conviction to suspend it until weve had an opportunity to brief the error
4645738 thats the next step and the second step is the appeal of course thatll give us time to see what the state of the virginia law is with regard to a call to arms and inflammatories and morality and decency and all those things that i can remember and we still dont know what the prosecution will try to do with the other movies were still in court on that one
4645739 but remember we have one solid hardcore movie that they found not obscene so of course that obviously establishes something that hasnt been established before
4645740 and were going to be altering the stock at this point accordingly getting rid of movies with the multiple partners till we get this sorted out were not done yet
4645741 we werent happy about splitting the baby here it was just a hair splitter i dont get it
4645742 what foreign tv series do you want to view thoroughly this summer holiday
4645743 there you go see you have committed a crime and if your husband had performed oral sex on you cunnilingus both of you have contravened the malaysian penal code and if convicted of this crime you are both liable to be imprisoned up to 20 years in addition to being whipped as well
4645744 are you nuts what in the world are you harping about
4645745 our malaysian penal code makes it a crime to perform oral or anal sex regardless of gender or consent as long as the penis is inside the anus or mouth it is considered a crime
4645746 holy molly these are such common and natural acts that the whole world is doing them if this is a crime then everyone is guilty everyone is a criminal
4645747 ah but under malaysian criminal laws these are considered unnatural acts carnal intercourse against the order of nature
4645748 whoever who created this law is a moron perhaps someone who indulges in straight sex only via missionary position perhaps someone who hails from a very conservative background i pity him because he would never know the joy and ecstasy of having a blow job done on him and he would never know how to satisfy his partner by giving her oral sex or maybe he doesnt care at all
4645749 anyway who is going to enforce this archaic law which is as yesterday as victorian chastity belts will there be a moral squad similar to the very active and occasionally bungling khalwat squad
4645750 members of the moral or sodomy squad must be trained to recognize a real and pseudo or imagined penis with a proliferation of dildoes around one could easily get mistaken about the object that enters the anus or mouth they should carry with them tools of their trade like tape measures cameras x ray binoculars and storage containers specially for semen specimens they also must be prepared to work graveyard hours as most sodomy activities are presumed to take place at night
4645751 and if time and budget allow they should also be trained to take dna samples this way their evidence will hopefully be able to stand in court i mean all their efforts would be wasted if it cannot stand in court right why prosecute under the sodomy provisions at all if their evidences are not strong enough when challenged in court
4645752 since the law is about justice i am sure the authorities do not want to be seen to victimize only some sodomites
4645753 and while they are at it they should recruit more executioners for malaysian prisons due to the spike in the number of prisoners requiring to be whipped build more prisons as well because more than half of the malaysian population are expected to be incarcerated for offences under
4645754 install hidden cameras in prostitution dens or hotel rooms as well
4645755 malaysian image took a severe beating when a former deputy prime minister was charged for sodomy and when a serving dpm was implicated in a murder involving a mongolian beauty it seems that in both cases sodomy allegedly took place therefore drastic measures are needed to show to the world that malaysians are not a nation full of sodomites
4645756 today it is clear that if the sexual revolution has occurred anywhere it is in the practice and acceptance of oral sex among people under age twenty five it is virtually a universal part of the sexual relationship
4645757 el viejo logan la cual promete mucho en estados unidos se ha agotado esta edici n y saben por qu es tan bueno y vende tanto porque lo escribe

4645759 may discuss this or that or even the other as well
4645760 telephoned the mccain campaign to politely complain it was being used
4645761 so our precaution at this point is to shut down the highway
4645762 the waters been dammed up on one side of the highway so basically this is a precautionary thing with regards to a fear of a landslide
4645763 theres a huge lake of water on the back of the road and its a very dangerous situation
4645764 were afraid the going to flood going to move and come out and crush right down over gambo we have all the houses evacuated under the road
4645765 the overflow from the hilly areas beyond the highway theres still a steady stream of water thats running into the area
4645766 i figure if im ever gonna do this this is the day to do this
4645767 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4645768 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4645769 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4645770 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4645771 i am a layman thankful to his church anchored by his faith and his humble background
4645772 well thats not my problem thats a stupid waste of time if you ask me
4645773 it takes the pain away but could not make you stay
4645774 lets take the complete and utter piss out of christianity

4645913 the suspension of stoning is a welcome if long overdue step and a tribute to the courageous efforts of iranian human rights defenders
4645914 however an earlier moratorium on stoning executions was breached so we shall be watching closely to see that this does not happen again

4645970 gentlemen this is what a football player looks like looks like looks like looks like
4645971 it never happened but ill bet that scene shows up when they make the movie
4645972 the very next season the crimson tide football team had three black players and such was the stature of bear bryant that once he recruited black athletes other coaches were quick to follow suit just like that segregation in southern college football was over
4645973 call us backward all you want but look at our
4645974 we auburns first black athletes were there to change things we felt it was our responsibility to really integrate the university to make it better for those kids to make it better for the charles barkleys the bo jacksons
4645975 i was tellin a guy about it and hes just noddin along and then he goes wait
4645976 walk on my reluctant journey to integration at auburn university

4645981 so just shave i mean bill cosby doesnt have a mustache oj simpson doesnt have one why do you want one
4645982 coach jordan he was in charge man there was no compromise in him
4645983 he tried to handle as if it were only three football players but when all the black athletes left at least momentarily it became a major crisis
4645984 they took a lot of bad press and it slowed down their efforts in recruiting black athletes
4645985 if wed sign one black guy alabama would sign half a dozen
4645986 i told it the way i wanted to tell it
4645987 it was the last of what i call the crew cut all white mentality in football i think the culture started to change after that
4645988 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4645989 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4645990 i really misspoke when i said i had lost my passion for the game
4645991 i think my competitive edge was dulled now its back
4645992 then i said make it a dollar and a nickel so his wife sharon can get her cut
4645993 seeing these college kids love the game as much as major leaguers got me going i had a blast

4646000 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4646045 zhang ning main lebih bagus dibandingkan waktu di semifinal indonesia terbuka juni lalu mungkin karena motivasinya lebih tinggi untuk mempertahankan medali emas dan bermain di kandang sendiri
4646046 kali ini saya kurang sabar setiap kali dapat bola enak langsung pengin mematikan dia bisa mengantisipasi ini dan saat posisi saya enggak enak langsung dismes padahal kalau saya lebih sabar dia banyak kesalahan sendiri
4646047 saya lebih optimistis menghadapi lu lan mental bertandingnya belum sekuat zhang ning dan xie xingfang semoga saya bisa mendapat perunggu
4646048 i will make you awesome in one absurdly action packed week
4646049 look at me im speaking at such and such on this date and i just published this or that
4646050 if anything i need somebody doing heavy duty financial stuff on the desktop
4646051 my theory is to be done with the book just in time to read a memory of light
4646052 keeps validation out of the domain and into a service object
4646053 it was a little confusing at first to figure it out
4646054 were trying to make it as easy as possible the number of people well have on the ground is targeted at helping guide people through the process

4646058 let me translate it hehe he told me to monitor her vital signs hourly hourly hourly holymacaroni i hate hourly monitoring its tiring especially if your patient is like kilometers away from the nurses station
4646059 but when he wrote his april 23rd column there were no warnings no cautions no hard questions asked the only thing they seemed unsure of was whether or not this thing was going to be as as big as toronto heres another question about lakeland that needs to be answered according to grady
4646060 apa yang dilakukan maria sudah maksimal ini prestasi tertinggi dia apalagi dia merupakan satu satunya pemain puteri di luar china yang masuk semifinal olimpiade
4646061 di babak sebelumnya maria mengalahkan pemain denmark tine rasmussen pemain denmark inilah yang sebenarnya sangat ditakuti kubu china
4646062 saya rasa ia telah mencapai tahap di mana ia sudah bisa mengukur bagaimana menghadapi lawan lawan yang berbeda
4646063 nanti ia akan mencapai tahap bisa membawa lawannya mengikuti gaya permainannya
4646064 yang saya lihat maria ini mentalnya bagus tidak takut kalah dia harus membuat dukungan penonton justru akan menjadi tekanan buat pemain china itu
4646065 zhang ning pasti ingin mempertahankan medali emas yang diraihnya di athena di usia 33 ia pasti ingin juara untuk mengejar hadiah dan bonus yang akan menjamin hidupnya saat pensiun sebagai pemain
4646066 apalagi saya baca ia ingin meraih medali emas bersama sama pacarnya lin dan ia ingin mengulangi apa yang saya lakukan bersama alan di olimpiade barcelona
4646067 its like all of your friends woke up one morning and cant stop talking about how funny it is that odie keeps going after garfields lasagna
4646068 i think what jeremys getting at and i apologize for putting words in your mouth jeremy is that if there is a business problem to be solved we should be avoiding solving technical problems especially when theyve already been solved well
4646069 i really like being able to put the query logic directly into business layer code instead of being hidden away deep in the bowels of one off repositories or services without sacrificing testability in the domain and service layers
4646070 im asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring about real change in washington im asking you to believe in yours
4646071 george is devastated by the allegations filed by the court
4646072 he is devastated and saddened that pam has aired the alleged dirty laundry
4646073 i dont know what im going to hear next about george
4646074 i am definitely supporting pam i definitely hope that he does not get custody of the kids
4646075 george is devastated by the allegations filed by the court
4646076 he is devastated and saddened that pam has aired the alleged dirty laundry
4646077 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4646078 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4646079 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4646080 oh i got the cooties now were against each other now
4646081 watch out what you post online because it could come back to haunt you
4646082 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4646083 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4646084 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4646085 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4646086 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4646087 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4646088 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4646089 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4646090 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4646091 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4646092 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4646093 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4646094 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4646095 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4646096 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4646097 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen

4646100 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4646101 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4646102 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4646103 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4646104 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite

4646108 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4646109 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4646110 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4646111 2000 decade 10 tracks in total have been announced so far
4646112 its these damn 866 people that call us a million times a day they arent saying anything i know someone on the phone no automated electronic message has started and would have bye now

4646119 saya tak mahu jadi ahli politik mat jenin tulis mat jenin meminta wartawan menulis panjat pokok kelapa belum dapat buah dah bercita cita nak jadi raja
4646120 dalam hal ini jika sesebuah parti itu mendapat sokongan majoriti rakyat dan seterusnya mendapat perkenan yang di pertuan agong berhubung jawatan perdana menteri pemimpin daripada parti itulah yang menjadi perdana menteri
4646121 from all appearances its always looked like the ef team was completely blowing off our original concerns about the usability of ef
4646122 oh on the other hand i guess we could just all do everything with nhibernate changing all of our properties to be overrideable and working with objects that arent really our objects at all but are generated proxy objects man i can see the hypocrisy in calling for poco when we have to deal with that kind of crap can anyone else
4646123 what is this set based algebra you speak of and how can i learn more
4646124 hey guys we still arent going to have poco in v1

4646135 we as muslims must ask does the theory of evolution and likewise the theory of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution conform to islamic teachings or conflict with them
4646136 o mankind we have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another verily the most honorable of you with allah is the one who is the most god fearing
4646137 human beings are the children of adam and adam was created from earth allah says o mankind we have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another verily the most honorable of you with allah is the one who is the most god fearing
4646138 the similitude of jesus before allah is as that of adam he created him from dust then said to him be and he was
4646139 o mankind be careful of your duty to your lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women
4646140 allah is the creator of all things and over all things he has authority
4646141 to grasp the reality of life as it has been revealed by molecular biology we must magnify a cell a thousand million times until it is twenty kilometers in diameter and resembles a giant airship large enough to cover a great city like london or new york
4646142 the most elementary type of cell constitutes a mechanism unimaginably more complex than any machine yet thought up let alone constructed by man
4646143 the spontaneous formation of a polypeptide of the size of the smallest known proteins seems beyond all probability
4646144 the likelihood of the spontaneous formation of life from inanimate matter is one to a number with 40 000 noughts after it it is big enough to bury darwin and the whole theory of evolution there was no primeval soup neither on this planet nor on any other and if the beginnings of life were not random they must therefore have been the product of purposeful intelligence
4646145 an honest man armed with all the knowledge available to us now could only state that in some sense the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle

4646155 the tennessee republican party has attempted to smear barack obama in a crude cynical outburst of dirty politics
4646156 to use anti semitism for political gamesmanship is an insult to jews of all political persuasions and frankly such a blatant stunt isnt going to fool anyone
4646157 john mccain not only needs to condemn this act immediately he needs to call off the hounds and instruct republicans to stop spreading smears on his behalf
4646158 otherwise we can only assume that this self proclaimed straight talker consents to such smear tactics
4646159 at least by our lights mr obamas commitment to israel as he has articulated it so far in his campaign is quite moving and a tribute to the broad bipartisan support that the jewish state has in america
4646160 identical to arguments made in the arab world that justify their pursuit of nuclear weapons because israel has nuclear weapons
4646161 as barack has put it iraq is under occupation by america which makes one wonder how he feels about israeli settlements

4646167 waraqa had been converted to christianity in the pre lslamic period and used to write arabic and write of the

4646171 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
4646172 this text concerning the heavenly witness is not contained in any greek manuscript which was written earlier than the fifteenth century it is not cited by any of the ecclesiastical writers not by any of early latin fathers even when the subjects upon which they treated would naturally have lead them to appeal to its authority it is therefore evidently spurious
4646173 the famous interpolation after three witnesses is not printed even in rsvn and rightly it cites the heavenly testimony of the father the logos and the holy spirit but is never used in the early trinitarian controversies no respectable greek ms contains it appearing first in a late 4th cent latin text it entered the vulgate and finally the nt of erasmus
4646174 for all of the above reasons we find that when thirty two biblical scholars backed by fifty cooperating christian denominations got together to compile the revised standard version of the bible based upon the most ancient biblical manuscripts available to them today they made some very extensive changes among these changes was the unceremonious discardal of the verse of 1 john 5 7 as the fabricated insertion that it is

4646176 jhn 5 17 but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work
4646177 without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god
4646178 why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your book quran which has been revealed to allahs apostle is newer and the latest you read it pure undistorted and unchanged and allah has told you that the people of the scripture jews and christians changed their scripture and distorted it and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said it is from allah to sell it for a little gain does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything no by allah we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you
4646179 people of the scripture jews and christians changed their scripture and distorted it and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said it is from allah
4646180 jews and christians changed their scripture and distorted it and wrote the scripture with their own hands
4646181 and there are among them illiterates who know not the book but see therein their own desires and they do nothing but conjecture
4646182 he it is who hath sent among the unlettered ones a messenger of their own to recite unto them his revelations and to make them grow and to teach them the scripture and wisdom though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest
4646183 neither did you read any book before it this quran nor did you write any book with your right hand meaning you lived among your people for a long time before you brought this quran during this time you never read any book or wrote anything your people as well as others all know that you are an unlettered man who does not read or write this is how he was also described in the previous scriptures as allah says those who follow the messenger the prophet the unlettered about whom they find written with them in the tawrah and the injil he commands them with good and forbids them from evil 7 157 this is how the messenger of allah will remain until the day of resurrection unable to write even one line or one letter he used to have scribes who would write down the revelation for him or would write letters from him to be sent to different places allahs saying in that case indeed the followers of falsehood might have doubted means if you had been literate some ignorant people would have doubted you they would have said that you learned this from books inherited from the prophets which came before indeed they did say that even though they knew that he was unlettered and could not read or write
4646184 those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they find mentioned in their own scriptures in the law and the gospel for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil he allows them as lawful what is good and pure and prohibits them from what is bad and impure he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them so it is those who believe in him honour him help him and follow the light which is sent down with him it is they who will prosper
4646185 so it is those who believe in him honour him help him and follow the light which is sent down with him it is they who will prosper
4646186 do not believe the people of the scripture or disbelieve them but say
4646187 we believe in allah and whatever is revealed to us and whatever is revealed to you
4646188 the scriptures do not seem to have been extant in an arabic version before the time of muhammad 570 632 who knew the gospel story only in oral form and mainly from syriac sources
4646189 narrated abdullah ibn umar a group of jews came and invited the apostle of allah peace be upon him to quff so he visited them in their school they said abulqasim one of our men has committed fornication with a woman so pronounce judgment upon them they placed a cushion for the apostle of allah peace be upon him who sat on it and said bring the torah it was then brought he then withdrew the cushion from beneath him and placed the torah on it saying i believed in thee and in him who revealed thee he then said bring me one who is learned among you then a young man was brought the transmitter then mentioned the rest of the tradition of stoning similar to the one transmitted by malik from nafi no 4431
4646190 we believe in allah and what is revealed to us
4646191 allah made a covenant of old with the children of israel and we raised among them twelve chieftains and allah said lo i am with you if ye establish worship and pay the poor due and believe in my messengers and support them and lend unto allah a kindly loan surely i shall remit your sins and surely i shall bring you into gardens underneath which rivers flow whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road and because of their breaking their covenant we have cursed them and made hard their hearts they change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them but bear with them and pardon them lo allah loveth the kindly and with those who say lo we are christians we made a covenant but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished therefore we have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection when allah will inform them of their handiwork o people of the scripture now hath our messenger come unto you expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the scripture and forgiving much now hath come unto you light from allah and plain scripture
4646192 the tawrah and the injil remain as allah revealed them and no letter in them was removed however the people misguide others by addition and false interpretation relying on books that they wrote themselves tafsir of quran by ibn kathir exegesis on surah 2 79
4646193 the tawrah and the injil remain as allah revealed them and no letter in them was removed
4646194 if thou wert in doubt as to what we have revealed unto thee then ask those who have been reading the book from before thee the truth hath indeed come to thee from thy lord so be in no wise of those in doubt
4646195 i believe in whatever book allah has sent down and i am commanded to judge justly between you
4646196 he said even so allah god createth what he willeth when he hath decreed a matter he but sayth o it be and it is and allah god will teach him the book and wisdom the torah law and the gospel

4646214 verily the most honoured of you in the sight of allah is he who is the most righteous of you

4646233 withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides restraining their hands

4646237 withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides restraining their hands
4646238 be careful to discriminate and say not unto one who offereth you peace
4646239 thus are you commanded by god to continue carrying out jihad against the unbelieving infidels until they submit to islam
4646240 the context of this verse was when the muslims were to fight their enemies for their very existence after thirteen years of endurance and patience the prophet and his companions had to leave their home town of makkah and to emigrate to madinah when the people of madinah had welcomed him there and he was accepted as a leader there the makkans became unhappy they wanted to eliminate muhammad and his religion and so they sent their army to root out islam and the crucial battle took place in badr

4646243 fighting therein is a grave offence but graver is it in the sight of allah to prevent access to the path of allah to deny him to prevent access to the sacred mosque and drive out its members

4646258 and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house
4646259 behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword
4646260 ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place

4646264 and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain
4646265 either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the
4646266 and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter
4646267 thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the sword
4646268 and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under the axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem
4646269 every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished
4646270 and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain
4646271 and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of hesbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every city but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves
4646272 i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things
4646273 samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her god their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up
4646274 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans foes shall be they of his own household
4646275 but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me
4646276 then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

4646294 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4646295 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4646296 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4646297 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
4646298 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4646299 no i dont i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
4646300 i came here with a crew on sunday to see some of the standup comedy performers
4646301 okay bitch bend over grab your ankles and tell me if this hurts
4646302 i grew up as a pretty good miler and running was integrally part of my character
4646303 when i was not recruited to the university of washington track team but rather the rowing team it took a lot of prayer to let go of the old and try the new little did i know that god made me perfectly to row
4646304 the technical changes i acquired helped me to get more out of each row
4646305 also my strength has increased as a result of these more efficient rowing practices i have no regrets and feel ready for my best in beijing
4646306 one of the coaches i met said i could take rowing as far as i wanted before i had ever even taken a stroke and she was so sincere
4646307 she really believed so i thought why not give it a try for a year two olympic games four world titles and four ncaa championship trophies later im still at it
4646308 my youth pastor helped me to see that even though i was a really good kid i wasnt perfect and i needed jesus so that i could be in a right relationship with god
4646309 i gave my life to jesus and my life has never been the same
4646310 if you cant be with the one you love love the one youre with
4646311 god iron man why are you being such a penis about this registration act
4646312 id really like one of pamplemousses terrible macarons but if only there were some way i could pay more money for them
4646313 i wonder if this place has them holy crap there they are i have to buy some and twitter this
4646314 hey i pay most of the bills around the house and feed my kids cupcakes do i get any respect
4646315 mexican bun its like a less sweet version of the pineapple and i love it their plain dinner buns are soo fluffy and delicious i love going to sunset bakery for buns and then having them with a latte at another cafe the prices are extremely reasonable its like 0 50 for a pineapple bun as opposed to shengkees 2 ones that are only half as food as sunset bakerys i cant exactly hang out at the bakery because its frequented by the owners friends and though theyre all really nice they love laughing and talking kind of loud so its hard to have your own conversations when theyre there with their grandchildren all in all i highly recommend this place my family has been going here for as long as i can remember ever going to san francisco to visit my relatives practically since i was 3 or something we always order boxes of their baked sio pao bbq pork of course i will always get their pineapple bun for dessert sometimes on rare occasions we would get their cakes i love their white fruit cakes yum also we may get their eclairs yum i would give this place 5 stars but i was traumatized a long time ago when i saw cockroaches in their display case ewww gross huh so every time i go there i have a habit of continuously scanning their case for little creepy crawlies the most luscious chinese strawberry fruit sponge cakes you will find in the city if not the entire region seriously if it wasnt for the horrid parking id be there every day stuffing my face with the compendium of cakes large and small egg tarts fruit tarts and pork buns on offer good for my pocketbook but kind of bad for the waistline their fruit custard tart is amazing i hear everything else is good too but i get tunnel vision when i visit and so cheap so cheap sorry well priced baked goods make me very excited i nursed an entire breakup with their cream puffs eclairs fruit tarts tiny cakes you name it i ate it i did get a little fat but i didnt spend a lot of money this place is amazing my wife and i got our wedding cake at sunset bakery the cake looked fabulous and was delicious our guests were thoroughly impressed by the appearance and taste of the cake we chose a mocha cake with fresh strawberry filling the cake was moist light and airy the strawberries were sweet and mouth wateringly delicious and smothered in whipped cream the frosting was fresh and sweet but not overly sweet we have come to know the owner and his family and have found them to be such pleasant and generous people i highly recommend this bakery great pork bun and other chinese bau great for grab and go while waiting for the bus also connie and leena can be pretty chatty and they are so lively and energetic great place for bau we used sunset bakery to make our wedding cake yes a little unexpected but they did a great job at an amazing price we ordered the white cake with fresh strawberry filling they decorated the cake for us with ribbon that matched our wedding items and delivered it to our reception location the cake was delicious and i will go back here to have anything in their bakery case they probably have the best cakes in town this is an asian bakery so the cakes and baked goods are not as sweet as traditional european bakeries they have cakes that are very hard to find like the water chestnut cake they have excellent chicken pies and their mocha cake is absolutely to die for i come here for birthday cakes and they also make a killer chocolate cake that is perfect blend of chocolate and sweetness not too sweet though it is extremely hard to find parking here so i would suggest grabbing a buddy and sending them in to pick up whatever you need if you are ordering a cake be sure to call in ahead so that they can make your cake i love this place my friend kat told me about if when i was shopping for wedding cakes i got a beautiful 4 tier wedding cake for 300 it was simple but so very yummy i also love the taste of their strawberry sponge cake and now that i have my daughter i will be buying all of her birthday cakes from here a whole sheet cake is only cost me 83 bucks its so worth it the only bad part is the parking i got my 4 tier wedding cake here for 300 it was beautiful and easily looked and tasted like it cost 3 times as much we got te strawberry sponge cake and it had a lightly sweet taste and nice fluffy icing i ended up bringing in some ribbon that they added to each tier at no extra cost they also deliverd the cake for free on time on a saturday afternoon really good cake light and more savory than sweet based on yelp went there last week to get a cake for a friends birthday went back this week because i want to impress visitors by having delicious cake staff is friendly as far as i know they only take cash i have only been to sunset bakery once it is definitely worth visiting i am glad sacramento does not have this type of bakery otherwise i will be ready to sumo in japan they have the best paper wrapped sponge cake its always best when it is fresh and if you need it in the morning for something you have to place an order the day before their sponge cake is what makes their cake so great its not sweet at all and the texture is nice i buy all my birthday cakes here in my opinion the fresh cream not that sickly yucky super sweet butter icing crap that every bakery slathers cakes with and strawberry cake is the best and you can call them up on the same day and put in an order and theyll have it ready i love it because the cake is not heavy and definitely not too sweet swear to god just get a 10
4646316 so im supposed to be getting ready for the day and i promised my friend i would only write my review of the castro theatre but
4646317 so soft that you want to use it as a pillow
4646318 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
4646319 god is real because a banana lines up with your hand
4646320 what you might not hear is that the illinois senator who made history thursday by winning the democratic caucus in iowa has made jewish leaders an early stop at every stage in his political career
4646321 when i am president the united states will stand shoulder to shoulder with israel in search of this peace and in defense against those who seek its destruction
4646322 a clear and strong commitment to the security of israel our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy that will always be my starting point
4646323 and when we see all of the growing threats in the region from iran to iraq to the resurgence of al qaeda to the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah that loyalty and that friendship will guide me as we begin to lay the stones that will build the road that takes us from the current instability to lasting peace and security
4646324 what has always struck me about senator obama and this is one of the reasons i have endorsed his candidacy for the united states presidency is that a love for israel and a desire to keep the jewish people secure is evident not just in his work but also in his heart
4646325 as president obama will be the friend to israel that we all want to see in the white house stalwart in his defense of israels security and committed to helping israel achieve peace with its neighbors
4646326 were no shills for mr obama but these republicans who questioned the senators support for israel havent checked their facts at least by our lights mr obamas commitment to israel as he has articulated it so far in his campaign is quite moving and a tribute to the broad bipartisan support that the jewish state has in america
4646327 allegations that sen barack obama was educated in a radical muslim school known as a madrassa are not accurate according to cnn reporting
4646328 we welcome barack obamas condemnation of the anti semitic rhetoric of minister louis farrakhan and his making clear that he did not agree with his churchs decision to honor farrakhan issues of racism and anti semitism must be beyond the bounds of politics when someone close to a political figure shows sympathy and support for an individual who makes his name espousing bigotry that political figure needs to distance himself from that decision senator obama has done just that
4646329 of particular concern over the past several weeks many in our community have received hateful emails that use falsehood and innuendo to mischaracterize senator barack obamas religious beliefs and who he is as a person
4646330 these tactics attempt to drive a wedge between our community and a presidential candidate based on despicable and false attacks and innuendo based on religion we reject these efforts to manipulate members of our community into supporting or opposing candidates
4646331 as regards israel she has become an important supporter of the jewish state both in public and perhaps more importantly behind the scenes she is held in the highest regard by those who regularly plead israels cause in the halls of government for those who initially were wary of her positions on middle east issues and we include ourselves in that category ms clinton has proved to be a pleasant and welcome surprise
4646332 with israel because it is a beacon of democracy in a neighborhood that is shadowed by radicalism extremism despotism and terrorism
4646333 from her first trip to israel on new years day in 1982 through her years as a u s senator hillary clinton has a long history of strong and steadfast leadership for the us israel relationship her connection to the state of israel which began when as the first lady of arkansas she brought an innovative israeli preschool education program to her state has grown
4646334 hillary recognizes that israel is a most important strategic ally against the scourge of terrorism and radicalism
4646335 the syrians apparently were putting together and perhaps over some period of years a nuclear facility and the israelis took it out
4646336 in partnership with the american red cross senator clinton has been a strong and engaged leader in support of magen david adoms acceptance into the international red cross and red crescent movement
4646337 senator edwards did not say nor does he believe that the greatest short term threat to world peace is the possibility that israel would bomb irans nuclear facilities senator edwards said as he has in the past that iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest short term threats to world peace
4646338 for years the u s hasnt done enough to deal with what i have seen as a threat from iran
4646339 to ensure that iran never gets nuclear weapons we need to keep all options on the table let me reiterate all options must remain on the table
4646340 whether its iraq or terrorism the saudis have fallen way short of what they need to be doing
4646341 the israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves they should defend themselves they have an obligation to defend themselves
4646342 and i might add it is very important for america to crack down on the saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9 11 and its important for america to confront the situation in iran because iran is an enormous threat to israel and to the israeli people
4646343 as regards israel she has become an important supporter of the jewish state both in public and perhaps more importantly behind the scenes she is held in the highest regard by those who regularly plead israels cause in the halls of government for those who initially were wary of her positions on middle east issues and we include ourselves in that category ms clinton has proved to be a pleasant and welcome surprise
4646344 you are a strong advocate for religious freedom and in so many ways an inspiration
4646345 with israel because it is a beacon of democracy in a neighborhood that is shadowed by radicalism extremism despotism and terrorism
4646346 is not only a friend and ally for us it is a beacon of what democracy can and should be
4646347 the u s must do everything it can through diplomatic economic and military aid to maintain israels qualitative edge and keep israel strong and safe in a dangerous region america must always stand by our friend the only democracy in the region and take measures to strengthen its vibrant economy
4646348 f or years the u s hasnt done enough to deal with what i have seen as a threat from iran
4646349 to ensure that iran never gets nuclear weapons we need to keep all options on the table let me reiterate all options must remain on the table
4646350 whether its iraq or terrorism the saudis have fallen way short of what they need to be doing
4646351 the israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves they should defend themselves they have an obligation to defend themselves
4646352 and i might add it is very important for america to crack down on the saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9 11 and its important for america to confront the situation in iran because iran is an enormous threat to israel and to the israeli people
4646353 senator edwards did not say nor does he believe that the greatest short term threat to world peace is the possibility that israel would bomb irans nuclear facilities senator edwards said as he has in the past that iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest short term threats to world peace
4646354 once enacted will provide needed information about which companies are supporting irans energy industry clarify that state and local governments have the authority to divest of such companies and provide legal protection for those governments that wish to do so
4646355 make no mistake if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries they are badly mistaken
4646356 our job is to renew the united states efforts to help israel achieve peace with its neighbors while remaining vigilant against those who do not share this vision that effort begins with a clear and strong commitment to the security of israel our strongest ally in the region and its only established democr acy that will always be my starting point
4646357 and when we see all of the growing threats in the region from iran to iraq to the resurgence of al qaeda to the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah that loyalty and that friendship will guide me as we begin to lay the stones that will build the road that takes us from the current instability to lasting peace and security

4646359 what has always struck me about senator obama and this is one of the reasons i have endorsed his candidacy for the united states presidency is that a love for israel and a desire to keep the jewish people secure is evident not just in his work but also in his heart
4646360 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
4646361 things that are taken by violence must be taken back by violence
4646362 they kill women and children everyday so why should i feel bad
4646363 from camels to rolls the rise of the hashemites and their quest for cool cars

4646403 we continue to target a fall to 85 cents on this move
4646404 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4646405 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
4646406 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
4646407 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4646408 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4646409 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
4646410 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again
4646411 i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit
4646412 i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4646413 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
4646414 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4646415 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4646416 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything
4646417 the first time he gets me in a boat and gets me out about 50 feet and says all right were fishing for paycheques today im swimming back if i drown you guys will know what happened
4646418 we just decided to have a little fun with it

4646430 i dont think the pit stop strategy ruined the race any more than how bad our car was handling or running at that particular part of the race
4646431 i was going backward as it was so it aint like we screwed ourselves on pit strategy the car wasnt that good we just kind of stayed out there longer than anybody else
4646432 it was fun to lead hell i didnt want to pit either you know what i mean i was leading the race that was fun
4646433 it was very very fast at the start of the race but that wasnt the car i had there the last half of that race i didnt have that good of car i dont think many people that are very critical of tony jr knew that
4646434 we just need to continue to build this is a deal that is still a work in progress
4646435 well keep thrashing on things and doing things at the shop that we need to do
4646436 this is one of our newest cars here its a lot lighter thats a step in the right direction rather than just trying to get to the race track every week just starting to build stuff and refine it and make it better if we can continue to do that during the remainder of the year and pick back up a little bit and start getting more consistent and finish out on a high note we can roll into daytona locked in the top 35 in owners points and go from there

4646438 everything worked fairly well together the car was extremely tight and peter sospenzo crew chief and the guys made some changes and made it better thats something i hadnt seen in weeks its been pretty cool
4646439 michaels been great hes like everybody else he wants some help i dont have a magic wand or anything i cant come in here and fix the world but i can give them feedback and maybe theyll listen to me and thats what michael waltrip wanted me to do so here we are
4646440 i dont want to give up my seat you know i wanted to continue forward but at the same time this is going to give us an opportunity to possibly help all three of our cars and definitely myself when i get back in richmond hopefully ill have learned something and the team has too
4646441 hes just trying to help out and give us as much information as he can
4646442 its different to have a veteran guy in there saying hey its doing this than it is a rookie guy and its got nothing to do with my ability or my feedback hes got credibility because hes been doing it for so long and done so many races
4646443 it instantly helps the team understand whats going on as much as i hate being out im also excited about seeing what our cars are capable of doing and if theres a position where we can better ourselves im all for it
4646444 michael waltrip racing is committed to putting me back in the car and committed to building for 09
4646445 in my eyes its just a matter of learning as much as i can

4646454 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4646455 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4646456 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4646457 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4646458 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4646459 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4646463 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4646464 we came to the conclusion that i needed a kind of spiritual reality check and powell had given me some bible verses to check on at the start of the week and i hadnt done it
4646465 i finally sat down thursday night and wrote them all out so i was reciting a few verses i already knew
4646466 then he gave me the idea to recite some of the ones hed given me thats all i did on the back nine try to recite a couple of verses from galatians i guess it worked
4646467 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour
4646468 i guess that coming from a kind of sister country australia theres a good vibe

4646475 what do you think about banning pier jumping at holland state park
4646476 whoever the next president is he will have significant difficulties to deal with in the us russia relationship
4646477 senator obamas view is that we need to review all aspects of our bilateral and multilateral arrangements with russia in order to assess where they ought to go from here
4646478 if russia is going to take the position that not only is it not interested in integrating in that fashion but it is not going to allow its supposedly sovereign and independent neighbors to do so that calls into doubt the entire premise of us european and western international relations with russia
4646479 i dont think there is much difference between the candidates on this question and its going to be a huge challenge for the next administration
4646480 a mccain administration would be directly and overtly adversarial to russia but i think that you can overstate the differences between the two candidates on this subject
4646481 the russian government desperately wants the west to treat it as an important and respected great power
4646482 we can and should withhold that treatment no diplomatic business as usual
4646483 what do you think about banning pier jumping at holland state park
4646484 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4646485 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4646486 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4646487 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4646488 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4646489 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

4646492 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
4646493 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
4646494 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4646495 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4646496 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4646497 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4646498 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4646499 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4646500 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4646501 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
4646502 it was a cruel terrorist attack to surprise a population as they celebrate
4646503 what i said was they have a very talented football team and they are the most talented team in the state of texas we cant match them up with talent but we can sure as hell try to out hit them and win the game on turnovers and that sort of thing
4646504 i dont remember questioning their toughness i was actually assessing their talent
4646505 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
4646506 first they ignore you then they ridicule you then they fight you then you win
4646507 he has a hairline fracture and is out for the year they are going to recheck him in three months and its got to heal once it heals i think he is okay i would hope

4646509 they were in different situations and whatever it was they made some plays tonight coupled with the fact this is the 30th pracice or so they have seen the offense they are ahead of the game the offense has to be more precise
4646510 i went out there and couldnt get a really good clean lap in at first but luckily the lap that ended up being our last was my fastest

4646515 in the recent years of increased acreage of corn and biofuels the amount of fertilizer used and the amount of nitrogen per volume of mississippi river water has increased dramatically
4646516 what we have is this pulse of nutrients that are coming down our rivers every year
4646517 somehow we have to find a way to stop that
4646518 the loss of fertilizer is an economic drain on the industry it is not something the farming community wants to happen and controlling it is the key to controlling the spread of dead zones
4646519 the cc gold coast builds upon the luxury sports coupe that debuted at the 2008 north american international auto show
4646520 weve added luxury and performance extras like tri coat paint high end interior appointments and ground affects that enhance the sportiness of our newest sedan
4646521 the fact that with his barbaric acts in south ossetia he saakashvili has undermined the viability of the georgian state shows the ossetian and abkhaz peoples that they will not be safe together with georgia
4646522 the crimes committed by the tbilisi regime in south ossetia merit investigation at an international tribunal

4646529 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4646530 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4646531 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4646532 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4646533 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4646534 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4646535 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4646536 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4646537 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4646538 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4646565 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program and will further increase the already considerable cost overruns delays and risks
4646566 congress needs to pull the plug before even more taxpayer money is wasted
4646567 to go forward with mox now areva would have to redesign the mox fuel and duke would have to repeat the entire experiment delaying the testing program by at least eight years doe should instead dispose of the plutonium directly by mixing it with radioactive waste and encasing it in glass which would be safer and cheaper than continuing the mox program

4646570 it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4646571 of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4646572 our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing now that the authorities are no longer looking for madeleine we implore everyone who has provided information to the inquiry to contact us
4646573 infamous empathy it is ridiculous to demand that we feel the pain of people of whom we know nothing and to blame religion for human selfishness
4646574 what a relief the somali found dead next to a jar of cyanide in denver right before
4646575 in general public defenders offices in latin america dont receive much support from their governments there is not enough funding in brazil for example only in the last few years have we begun to receive more attention from the government at this point thats the main obstacle
4646576 i dont know how much it could cost to bring a case before the court there are travel expenses hotel costs paperwork and procedures and there are cases that drag on for a long time
4646577 in addition technical experts have to be hired for the evidence
4646578 in our particular case so far we have not had any experience in this respect because turning to the court implies a major outlay of funds which our clients generally lack and we depend on organisations that can help
4646579 the main difficulty is knowledge we have basically been trained to handle cases at the domestic level and we lack the training we would need to turn to the international bodies
4646580 the state is not our enemy this hearing above and beyond the legal aspects should be educational in the sense that the ruling contributes to strengthening democracy in bolivia
4646581 democracy is more than just electing officials through the ballot box
4646582 it also implies living in a context of respect for human rights and means that impunity does not continue to surround pending cases whether or not they date back to a dictatorship we want to set a precedent so that no government in bolivia whether civilian or military will ever again illegally detain torture and disappear people this is about creating a culture of human rights
4646583 the court exercises great influence in the area of human rights and people have gradually come to understand its importance
4646584 plays a very positive role because of the recommendations it hands down and because the states party accept the recommendations and fulfil them
4646585 even though it lacks the infrastructure to deal with more cases the court has produced important results

4646786 it is our intention to show at trial that mr nugent caused the death of baron pikes by tasing him multiple times unnecessarily and in violation of louisiana law and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it
4646787 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
4646788 back on july 12th we reported on how 21 year old barron scooter collins was tased to death nine times over the course of 30 minutes it appears that the advocacy work by the family of baron scooter pikes and the work of radio talk show host tony brown along with the national reporting of the baron scooter pikes case by howard witt have caused winn parish district atty chris nevils to obtain an indictment of a former cop in a taser death in louisiana
4646789 a ruling in a racially explosive case that some forensic experts have described as police torture a grand jury in the small louisiana town of winnfield indicted a white police officer wednesday on charges of manslaughter and official malfeasance for repeatedly shocking a handcuffed black suspect with a taser device resulting in the mans death due to cardiac arrest
4646790 shot her with his taser to gain compliance and to avoid injury to himself for the ems crew
4646791 america shoots animals with anesthetic darts but electrocutes and executes human beings pre trial with 50 000 volts of frequently lethal force
4646792 the tasers will protect both the police officers and the citizens
4646793 we do realize that they are somewhat controversial but if the police officers tell people they have a taser we believe they wont need to use it
4646794 not only are we paying workmans comp for these injuries it also makes our insurance to go up
4646795 we believe that having tasers will stop the confrontations and end the minor scuffles with police officers
4646796 we will no longer sit idly by and ignore injustices
4646797 it becomes alarming when police can be in civilian clothing when they can use the most degrading of racial slurs to bring humiliation and embarrassment to our youth its an alarming thing when the rcmp can come to the aid of the perpetrators and not the aid of the victims
4646798 a small indian construction equipment company is demanding that google inc disclose the name of a person who used its blogging service in a case that could change the way the internet giant does business in india googles indian subsidiary google india private ltd is being sued in bombay high court by mumbai based gremach infrastructure equipments amp projects ltd for alleged defamation last september gremach bought a 75 stake in 11 coal mining licenses in mozambique this year a blogger using the name toxic writer criticized the company on blogger com a site that allows individuals to create blogs without publicly revealing their identities
4646799 this is an important acknowledgement that there is a serious problem with the widespread use of tasers
4646800 people are dying needlessly its important that the federal government is taking this seriously
4646801 following a thorough review the next step should be for the federal government to issue comprehensive federal regulations and guidelines on the use of tasers
4646802 there is growing evidence that a number of blacks in america are receiving high tech judge and jury on site electrocution by police around the country not only should the justice department investigate these crimes against humanity in the streets of america we a nation must stand up and demand the end of these actions by police who seem to be ill trained to use this weapon of next to last resort
4646803 the initial use of the taser is not in question
4646804 i can assure you of that its a lengthy period of time
4646805 many are associated with continuous or repeated discharge of the ced
4646806 typically people are incapacitated with a taser in under 10 seconds
4646807 there may be circumstances in which repeated or continuous exposure is required but law enforcement should be aware that the associated risks are unknown therefore caution is urged in using multiple activations of ced as a means to accomplish subdual
4646808 the officer was not confronted with circumstances that required the use of that type of force
4646809 a day of blogging for justice blogging against extra judicial electrocution tasers
4646810 he attempted to obtain information on both the mother and the child at which time the mother refused to give any information and became very agitated
4646811 greatly evaluate each situation with discretion when anticipating the deployment of the taser on young children elderly persons and pregnant females
4646812 the two other winnfield officers who were involved in the incident alan marsdin and cargyle junior branch both are still on the force

4646818 check out the video from a canadian company called lamperd less lethal is promoting the emd safety bracelet its equipped with electro muscular disruption technology which effectively short circuits the central nervous system zap someone and theyll be completely immobile for several minutes the technology isnt new cops and security guards have been using it for years in tasers whats new is the marketing approach lamperd is hawking the emd bracelet as the ideal tool for fighting terrorists intent on taking over an airplane and theyre doing so with a blatantly exploitive promotional video you can watch the five minute video which has gotten more than 33 000 hits at youtube
4646819 a senior government official with the u s department of homeland security dhs has expressed great interest in a so called safety bracelet that would serve as a stun device similar to that of a police taser according to this promotional video found at the lamperd less lethal website the bracelet would be worn by all airline passengers

4646822 as the general election approaches the demand for on time travel payment is as important as ever

4646824 the pressure in my leg was such i felt as though it was trying to burst through the skin i was begging and pleading with them to release the plaster because i couldnt stand the pain
4646825 i was told today youre a lucky man you are standing on two legs but tomorrow if youre standing on two legs youre a dead man they said your leg is absolutely dead and there is absolutely nothing that can be done for it
4646826 obviously it was an error i should have had my leg attended to but because it wasnt ive lost my leg but anger never does anyone any good in my opinion im a forward looking person all im hoping for is this is shown up so this doesnt happen again
4646827 this is very welcome news and many schools who have still not received complete results will undoubtedly feel some sense of vindication
4646828 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4646829 i hope that instead of finding another company to mark future key stage three test papers for 14 year olds the government will scrap these expensive and unnecessary tests altogether
4646830 ets demonstrated pure incompetence when it came to marking this years tests many children are still waiting for their results which are now nearly six weeks late ministers must confirm that ets will not receive a single penny for the fiasco
4646831 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4646832 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england

4646893 for the current fiscal year which ends march 31 2009 parliament has voted to spend more than 4 billion on cultural programs including the cbc the canada arts council the national gallery of canada and the department of canadian heritage
4646894 overall program spending during that same period is up 18 6 per cent in other words conservatives have boosted spending on arts programs faster than they have boosted overall government spending
4646895 with new cuts to culture and arts funding the conservative government is showing once again its complete disrespect toward our countrys cultural institutions and a flagrant lack of vision that is hurting our arts community and culture
4646896 the conservatives are now showing clearly what they have in mind for canadas arts and culture
4646897 the lack of explanation for the cuts and the silence of the heritage minister is unacceptable this governments consistent refusal to consider culture as an important part of canadas development is mind boggling

4646901 the liver cancer incidence rate is still increasing in china
4646902 so why do i talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential i stopped pretending to myself that i was anything other than what i was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me had i really succeeded at anything else i might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena i believed i truly belonged
4646903 you might never fail on the scale i did but some failure in life is inevitable it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all in which case you fail by default

4646929 mr medvedev confirmed that he would scrupulously respect its commitments to the accord notably the pull out of russian forces

4646953 while it is true that here we are concerned with financial dependency and not emotional dependence the whole relationship between the appellant and the deceased must be examined
4646954 dependent in the ordinary sense of the word means the condition of depending on something or on someone for what is needed
4646955 surely a mothers services to a young child satisfy the test the child could not survive without the provision of those services he or she needs them to suggest that in a money sense they are valueless is simply wrong
4646956 the same considerations apply to a step child or his or her step mother when the child lives with the step mother and is looked after by her i appreciate that a different view has been taken by others as for example by powell j in dunn v public trustee powell j 1 june 1989 unreported but i would respectfully disagree with that view in my opinion the plaintiff was partly dependent upon the deceased certainly for many years of her childhood and probably until her marriage although no doubt her dependence diminished in the latter years of this period

4646958 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes

4646969 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4646977 then i said make it a dollar and a nickel so his wife sharon can get her cut
4646978 seeing these college kids love the game as much as major leaguers got me going i had a blast
4646979 i loved playing but got more satisfaction out of managing said hargrove who also managed the baltimore orioles in 2000 03 before taking the seattle job in 2005
4646980 we had good players in cleveland and somebody had to drive the bus hargrove joked of guiding a club that included talents such as albert belle jim thome manny ramirez and others to five consecutive al central titles and world series appearances in 1995 and 1997

4646995 we believe this is going to take more services to members more resources and full time staff
4646996 there are amazing things going on behind the glass doors of cultural organizations everyday yet people are hesitant to walk in one of the biggest barriers is that so many people just dont know what is going on in st paul
4646997 is the desire to work together to partner to make the arts community in st paul even stronger now we just need to find the best and most economical ways of doing that
4646998 i played a mistake free round today which helped me increase my lead frasier said
4646999 there were so many putts that were burning the edge of the hole for birdie and lipping out but what are you going to do
4647000 i am not making anything this week so far thompson said
4647001 but if i make a few putts and roll in a few birdies early i can put some pressure on her going into the back nine tomorrow

4647013 i knew coming into the season regardless of what my performance was that this was going to be my last season he said friday
4647014 i feared that my abilities would diminish and i wanted to leave the game before that happened
4647015 ive never been secure in my role as a starter zavagnin said
4647016 ive always felt like i had to prove myself having that motivation and fear of failure always spurred me on and gave me motivation to succeed
4647017 you lose just a very solid veteran leader with a tremendous amount of experience vermes said
4647018 it becomes an extension of an organization when you have a guy who understands that game as well as he does its difficult when you lose someone like that on the field
4647019 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4647020 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4647021 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4647022 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4647023 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4647024 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4647025 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4647026 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4647027 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4647028 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
4647029 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
4647030 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4647031 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4647032 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4647033 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4647034 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4647035 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4647036 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4647037 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4647038 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4647039 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4647040 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet

4647044 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4647045 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4647046 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4647047 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4647048 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4647049 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4647050 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4647051 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4647052 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4647053 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4647054 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4647055 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4647056 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4647057 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4647058 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4647059 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4647060 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4647061 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4647062 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4647063 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4647064 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4647065 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4647066 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4647067 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4647068 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4647069 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4647071 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4647072 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4647073 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4647074 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4647075 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4647076 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4647077 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4647078 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4647079 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

4647083 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4647084 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4647085 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4647086 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4647087 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4647088 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4647089 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4647090 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4647091 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4647092 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4647093 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4647094 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4647095 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4647096 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4647097 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4647098 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4647099 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4647100 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4647101 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4647102 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4647103 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4647104 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4647105 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4647106 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4647107 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4647108 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4647109 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4647110 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4647111 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4647112 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4647113 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4647114 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4647115 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4647116 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4647117 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4647118 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4647119 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4647120 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4647121 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4647122 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4647123 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4647124 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4647125 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4647126 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4647127 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4647128 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4647129 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4647130 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4647131 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4647132 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4647133 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4647134 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4647135 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4647136 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4647137 just so you all know we did set a record
4647138 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4647139 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4647140 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4647141 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4647142 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4647143 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4647144 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4647145 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4647146 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4647147 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4647148 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4647149 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4647150 dockerys not 100 percent and i dont want to run emily into the ground
4647151 well have six healthy players but a lot of those kids need game time and game experience its a great opportunity for them to get better
4647152 hopefully it will be 100 percent eventually but it might linger a while but its not so bad i cant play ill do what i have to do
4647153 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4647154 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4647155 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4647156 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4647157 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4647158 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4647159 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4647160 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4647161 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4647162 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4647163 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4647164 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4647165 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4647166 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4647167 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4647168 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4647169 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4647170 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4647171 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4647172 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4647173 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4647174 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4647175 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4647176 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4647177 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4647178 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4647179 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4647180 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4647181 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4647182 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4647183 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4647184 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4647185 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4647186 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4647187 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4647188 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4647189 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4647190 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4647191 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4647192 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4647193 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4647194 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4647195 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4647196 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4647197 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4647198 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4647199 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4647200 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4647201 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4647202 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4647203 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4647204 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4647205 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4647206 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4647207 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4647208 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4647209 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4647210 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4647211 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4647212 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4647213 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4647214 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4647215 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4647216 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4647217 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4647218 at both home and work i use vista and xp resulting me typing
4647219 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4647220 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4647221 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4647222 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4647223 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4647224 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4647225 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4647226 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4647227 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4647228 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4647229 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4647230 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4647231 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4647232 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4647233 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4647234 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4647235 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4647236 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4647237 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4647238 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4647239 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4647240 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4647241 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4647242 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

4647244 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4647245 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4647246 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4647247 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4647248 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4647249 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4647250 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4647251 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4647252 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4647253 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4647254 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4647255 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4647256 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4647257 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4647258 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4647259 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4647260 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4647261 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4647262 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4647263 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4647264 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4647265 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4647266 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4647267 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4647268 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4647269 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4647270 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4647271 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4647272 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4647273 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4647274 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4647275 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4647276 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4647277 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4647278 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4647279 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4647280 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4647281 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

4647321 we are hoping for a positive issue because if not there are a lot of things that can come out into the open and have very bad consequences for the bulldogs and nrl
4647322 the bulldogs have been honest open and transparent in these discussions with sonny bill williams and his management
4647323 its not ideal but the big issue for us was obtaining the injunction and the fact that he complied with it by not playing then entering into negotiations with the bulldogs
4647324 its a substantial sum but it was never going to finish completely satisfactorily
4647325 walking out mid contract is still a shock to most people in the game

4647443 warrens attempt to redefine evangelicals by breaking with the politics of the past
4647444 doesnt want to talk about just abortion and gay marriage but also poverty and disease
4647445 thats because rick warren says many younger evangelicals define social issues broadly to include global warming human rights poverty not just abortion
4647446 but false rumors obamas a muslim his controversial former pastor and his liberal views on abortion and other issues complicate obamas efforts to win over evangelical voters

4647522 we found that women who were using combined estrogen and progestin hormone therapy had a nearly 300 percent increased risk in their risk of lobular but only a 40 percent increase in their risk of ductal cancer
4647523 there is clear strong consistent evidence that using combined estrogen and progestin hormone therapy increases a womans risk of breast cancer it is less well known how these hormones influence risk of different types of breast cancer
4647524 people who take combined estrogen and progestin are running a significant risk of cancer and heart disease they really need to know that
4647525 nothing in this paper is new as far as im concerned it doesnt change the current recommendations which are that we should use hormone therapy in 1 the lowest effective dose 2 for the shortest period of time possible and 3 consistent with patient treatment goals with reevaluation periodically

4647528 the hoaxer stitch up of john humble and the corrupt policeman responsible
4647529 decision refused as being totally without merit none of the grounds of appeal have any possibility whatsoever of success no evidence was produced which began to establish the truth of these defamatory statements and none of the criticisms of the judge or his conduct of the proceedings have any substance this decision is final
4647530 i would appeal to anyone who has seen a watch or phone like beckys to come forward
4647531 my team has focused on a large number of suspects over a very short period of time

4647538 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch

4647557 blackmail is the crime of threatening to reveal substantially true information about a person to the public a family member or associates unless a demand made upon the victim is met this information is usually of an embarrassing and or socially damaging nature as the information is substantially true the act of revealing the information may not be criminal in its own right nor amount to a civil law defamation the crime is making demands to withhold it

4647562 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4647563 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial

4647579 i never really felt that martin did it for that reason i think he did it to make money and that he thought with larry in charge and paying good rates that he could do it now he probably wouldnt have minded if it would have taken a bite out of marvels profits but i dont think it was done out of revenge i think martin was too smart for that
4647580 chip was supposed to take his place but that part of it must not have been on paper because as soon as martin was gone they got rid of chip thats why martin started atlas comics it was pure revenge
4647581 one of the problems was just being martin goodmans son i dont think that martin respected chip very much he put chip in charge but would treat him with less than benign contempt in front of other people martin was a little cruel sometimes

4647588 we play pretty much every day at the dominion club together
4647589 it was nice to get a victory last week i think it gave me a little bit of confidence coming into today particularly with the putter because thats typically the biggest barometer in terms of how well i play
4647590 im generally a fairly consistent ball striker but if i dont putt well im going to shoot a fairly ordinary round whereas if i putt reasonably well ill be at least somewhat competitive
4647591 i hope every virginia fan and the fans of our opponents make fan fest a pregame destination
4647592 the university has been supportive of our efforts to use this newly created area to entertain fans on football saturdays from live music to a variety of food options and interactive games weve created a plan that will be fun for all ages

4647602 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4647603 although there is a track featuring two legends that had a huge beef years back but have since reconciled and have done a few joints together

4647610 its frustrating because i know we had such a good team and could have done some good things in the tournament
4647611 against real the goal is to try to get to first and then you go from there
4647612 if we win we go to the top which would be an achievement because it has been a slow grind for us
4647613 obviously it was a great experience but our focus is now on mls i dont know what my role will be against rsl but whatever it is i am 100 percent committed and looking to help the team get back to the top of the west

4647641 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4647642 once again people are closing their eyes to the reality and creating myths i did not make a strong statement because i refuse to accept this widespread simplified interpretation which paints the georgians as the victims and the russians as the villains that is a gross oversimplification of the situation and i would have to write a lengthy article to explain why i do not share this view
4647643 this is a long term problem in the countrys foreign policy and unfortunately it does not come as a surprise czech foreign policy suffers from a lack of coordination especially in times of big international crisis when different politicians and institutions in the country speak with different voices we can of course argue about which stance is correct in this particular situation but at the same time i think that the czech republic should have a mechanism which would allow it to reach a unified stance on crises such as this one

4647647 we know that people have been discouraged from bicycle commuting because of a lack of a secure place to park their bicycles after they arrive at their destination the security from theft vandalism and damage by the elements that the bikelid provides will hopefully become a major factor in encouraging the growth of cycling as a serious mode of commuter transportation we hope that everyone will visit the uptown rest stop on park avenue between 50th and 51st streets eastside and visit the bikelid exhibit

4647669 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4647670 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4647671 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4647672 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4647673 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4647674 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4647675 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4647676 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4647677 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4647678 no you ordered a katsu thats what you told me

4647682 it bounced so hard off his head that the third baseman caught it i didnt get out of the batters box i was so sick
4647683 it was an inside fastball i hit it where its pitched i didnt mean to
4647684 trevor wilson told me fast freddie thats not your fault
4647685 i congratulated him for being back and said i didnt mean to hit it like that lewis said
4647686 he said ill never throw you another fastball over the plate
4647687 brad always knew he was in for big things and guess what he was said palmer who
4647688 i pitched eight days in a row in venezuela this winter he said
4647689 weve lost four in a row wed like to get more offense and well go with the guys whove been swinging it bochy said
4647690 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4647691 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4647692 those who have not swords can still die upon them
4647693 to live in the world you must be prepared to defend yourself
4647694 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4647695 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4647696 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4647697 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4647698 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4647699 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
4647700 but i want to say one thing to the american people i want you to listen to me im going to say this again i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky i never told anybody to lie not a single time never these allegations are false and i need to go back to work for the american people thank you
4647701 i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
4647702 i just thought this was the time to come forward and reveal this
4647703 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
4647704 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
4647705 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
4647706 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
4647707 what is interesting about the us response is that you have the mccain campaign in one corner immediately understanding the significance of russias aggression and in the opposite you have the bush administration standing with the obama campaign taking a much more diluted stance
4647708 and now with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4647709 the solidarity of the united states with georgia and its people in this moment of crisis
4647710 that is americas position and in my discussions with my european colleagues it is the position of the europeans as well
4647711 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4647712 but our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4647713 and eventually we need a more robust and impartial peacekeeping international force that would follow those monitors
4647714 we are under a russian invasion and russian occupation right now
4647715 and we want to end this russian invasion and occupation
4647716 access must be immediate and unimpeded for those humanitarian efforts
4647717 when the security situation in georgia is stabilized we will turn immediately to reconstruction
4647718 to rapidly develop an economic support package for the georgian economy to build on its demonstrated track record and to resume its rapid growth
4647719 restore georgias economy and reinforce investor confidence as georgia returns to its position as the leading economy in the region
4647720 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4647721 the free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications of this russian attack on its neighbor for security in the region and beyond
4647722 and now with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4647723 the solidarity of the united states with georgia and its people in this moment of crisis
4647724 that is americas position and in my discussions with my european colleagues it is the position of the europeans as well
4647725 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
4647726 but our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4647727 and eventually we need a more robust and impartial peacekeeping international force that would follow those monitors
4647728 we are under a russian invasion and russian occupation right now
4647729 and we want to end this russian invasion and occupation
4647730 access must be immediate and unimpeded for those humanitarian efforts
4647731 when the security situation in georgia is stabilized we will turn immediately to reconstruction
4647732 to rapidly develop an economic support package for the georgian economy to build on its demonstrated track record and to resume its rapid growth
4647733 restore georgias economy and reinforce investor confidence as georgia returns to its position as the leading economy in the region
4647734 paul is over the moon and couldnt wait to jump on a plane
4647735 its a very personal thing meeting a new grandchild for the first time but he loves nancy so much that he wanted her to be there
4647736 he is only expected to be here a few days to catch up with the family before he flies back to the us with nancy
4647737 we have had to simultaneously fight the taliban build more than a dozen defensive strongpoints train new afghan national police and conduct civic action programs to win over the local population and were doing it our motto ready for all yielding to none says it all
4647738 nothing in the field manuals could fully prepare us for this but we adapt and overcome
4647739 i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country
4647740 i look into putins eyes and i see k g b
4647741 mr obama what do you see when you look into vladimir putins eyes
4647742 looking into putins eyes i see a hunger for change from a leader who is tired of war waged by greedy capitalists and texas cowboys who are puppets of the oil industry
4647743 i see a man who would rather talk than fight
4647744 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4647745 what started as a conversation back in poland last year has led me to be here in konotop ukraine working in partnership with a charity called eastern european outreach with me is the person who began that conversation with me in poland last year eeo director jeff thompson
4647746 tell us a bit about this story and what led us to having this team thats here at the moment
4647747 this is a center where a lady named lena yuschenko lives with her handicapped daughter and we discovered a group of families here with handicapped children with cerebral palsy and other diseases or handicaps
4647748 she just began to pray and i met lena several years ago and found out about her desire to care for the handicapped children here in konotop and we were able to help them out to buy a little building sponsors have stepped up to help them today its exciting to see some of that support and hard work come to fruition to see the kids here being ministered to
4647749 you actually ran a marathon in los angeles to raise funds for this project and you and your team from england were able to raise 5 000 to help with a playground project here for the kids now the children here in konotop some are handicapped some are not come here to the center and now they have a place to play actually to hang out lena and some of the staff can be with them and do some bible studies with them so that support has been used to do some landscaping build a playground get some benches and furniture and just step by step were trying to outfit the center here so that it can be used
4647750 because the center has been in disrepair and now that its been repaired largely we can host teams we plan on having many more here
4647751 this is a forgotten place this is not where typical church groups or other teams come its a great opportunity to work with lena and her friends volunteers and staff because they are working themselves here they are ministering to the children the best they can so they appreciate when church groups and others come and bring their expertise such as people that you have on your team with child behavior degrees and people experienced with working with handicapped children they want that partnership so we just want to facilitate future partnerships like that to happen
4647752 its wonderful to see such a talented team that youve brought here this week as well as hearing the kids voices here in this place and being ministered to really to the glory of god were excited about it and we need many more people to come to help get this konotop center finished
4647753 these kids deserve it and theyre being saved theyre being brought to good health we can resource them with not only a place to come to but also physical equipment physical education and working with them physically as well as spiritually and emotionally and to help encourage their mothers to keep going to keep caring for the kids thats been the greatest benefit is encouraging the mothers of handicapped children
4647754 were only really able to do a certain amount of visits and work with them
4647755 we see this center one as a place where when the teams come they can stay here
4647756 in the eastern portion of ukraine near the russian border its not like many people come here
4647757 we need to get some of these rooms finished get some beds in get some flooring down some landscaping finished and get some equipment in here
4647758 please pray for us we need their prayers for assist europe and for eastern european outreach
4647759 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
4647760 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4647761 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4647762 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4647763 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4647764 there was no mistaking the feeling of empowerment and seriousness of purpose which rippled through the fifth graders
4647765 great great love it put it in a box and ship it yep people will love it
4647766 hes been not only part of the national team program but hes been a part of major league soccer from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
4647767 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4647768 love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word
4647769 any comparison between the two armies was astonishing on the one hand there was the american army complete with helicopters an air force armor electronic communications artillery and mind boggling riches to say nothing of ammunition fuel spare parts and equipment of all kinds on the other there were the north vietnamese troops who had been walking on foot for four months carrying some artillery rounds on their backs and using a tin spoon to eat a little ground rice from a tin plate
4647770 abu youssef returned one more time to his little store and asked to take the cigarettes to sell and support his family until he could come home
4647771 they have the power to stop this shit and no one does the power is in the people its always been with the people but no one wants to stand up
4647772 for the legal community to rise up in defense of the rule of law
4647773 could you help me get a little food or coffee
4647774 it was a cruel terrorist attack to surprise a population as they celebrate
4647775 if it is something that is going to give women better protection then we should see if that is something we can get hold of
4647776 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4647777 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4647778 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4647779 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4647780 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4647781 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4647782 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4647783 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4647784 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and
4647785 oh a man in a dress how very silly isnt it
4647786 every great project needs to transform itself in order to excel and today we are starting that process
4647787 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
4647788 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
4647789 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
4647790 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4647791 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4647792 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4647793 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in
4647794 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4647795 the integration of the into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4647796 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of
4647797 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4647798 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4647799 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4647800 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4647801 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4647802 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4647803 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4647804 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4647805 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast
4647806 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4647807 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4647808 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4647809 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4647810 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4647811 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really
4647812 were all equal under the hooves of sheep and cattle
4647813 it was the right place to break the world record and i had hoped i would but it was not so
4647814 whenever i go for a record ill be in the front
4647815 i had a gold medal in world championships but that was nothing for me but i was expecting something from this olympics and i got it im really really very much delighted
4647816 so i dont feel it a pity of being overtaken by her anyway i got my personal best which is a european record
4647817 all our scouts raved about his competitiveness and demeanor on the mound
4647818 to add that type of young pitcher to our system is consistent to what were trying to do
4647819 nolan ryan was such a great competitor he was always a bulldog when he pitched i want to be just like him
4647820 its funny to get drafted by the rangers and him being the president of the team i like to get in there and compete
4647821 hes been not only part of the national team program but hes been a part of major league soccer from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
4647822 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4647823 but sometimes its a lot of fun being a misanthrope why spoil her thing
4647824 from looking at this video this person entered the store with one purpose in mind not to shop not to rob but to take this victims life
4647825 were trying to identify who the shooter was and also what the motive was whether it was some type of personal disagreement or something regarding the service station
4647826 we are in a different position financially than barack obama
4647827 the question is when do you reach the law of diminishing returns
4647828 were talking about spending more than 80 million in 60 days you get to a point where you hit your saturation point in your target states
4647829 the obama campaign is going to be able to widen the playing field and put mccain on the defensive in states that he shouldnt have to be on the defensive in georgia montana alaska mccain will either have to put resources there or have to face the potential of losing them
4647830 we had to make some tough calls in october we pulled out of missouri west virginia these were tough calls if we had the money we would have tried
4647831 theyre going to have all those texts so they can return to those people on election day with texts that say hey go vote today
4647832 members cannot access the www mac com website it will be restored asap read more for interim solutions
4647833 who are those guys and why are they looking at me
4647834 if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be the greatest prodigality
4647835 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4647836 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4647837 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4647838 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4647839 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4647840 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4647841 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4647842 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4647843 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4647844 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4647845 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4647846 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4647847 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4647848 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4647849 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4647850 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

4647852 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4647853 long distance caregivers can offer perspective because they arent on the scene every day to really observe small changes and that perspective is very valuable
4647854 sometimes if youre in a care situation day after day you feel overwhelmed and hopeless and you cant see out of that box but a person who comes in from the outside can help pinpoint a problem and recommend ways to help improve the situation

4647856 ten warning signs your older family member may need help
4647857 transitions can be rough or smooth depending on the nature of the situation whether its a crisis or something thats been coming gradually and the nature of the person being cared for
4647858 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4647859 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4647860 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4647861 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4647862 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4647863 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4647864 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4647865 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4647866 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4647867 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4647868 who are open to doing something on the production side
4647869 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4647870 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4647871 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4647872 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4647873 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4647874 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4647875 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4647876 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4647877 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4647878 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4647879 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4647880 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4647881 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4647882 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4647883 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4647884 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4647885 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4647886 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4647887 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4647888 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4647889 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4647890 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4647891 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4647892 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4647893 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4647894 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4647895 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4647896 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4647897 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4647898 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4647899 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4647900 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4647901 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4647902 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4647903 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4647904 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4647905 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4647906 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4647907 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4647908 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4647909 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4647910 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4647911 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4647912 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4647913 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4647914 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4647915 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4647916 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4647917 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4647918 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4647919 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4647920 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4647921 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4647922 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4647923 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4647924 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4647925 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4647926 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4647927 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4647928 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4647929 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
4647930 nasa does not track ufos nasa is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe
4647931 what if as the popular fox television program 24 recently portrayed a high level terrorist leader is caught who knows the location of a nuclear weapon
4647932 jack bauer saved los angeles he saved hundreds of thousands of lives
4647933 a beautiful gown like this shouldnt be wasted on any but the most special of occasions
4647934 no this dress deserves to be worn by a real first lady
4647935 my my would you just look at this all dressed up and no place to go
4647936 i suppose the american people want better for their first lady than some pie eyed boy from arkansas with a head full of dreams and all the grace of a peeled potato i only hope michelle obama or cindy hensley mccain will have the courage to change those hideous drapes in the lincoln bedroom
4647937 oh this old thing prime minister fukuda you do go on
4647938 it was silly of me to waste so much money on such an extravagant outfit but when i saw it in the store i thought to myself bill thats your inauguration dress
4647939 i suppose its for the best though knowing me i would have spilled champagne all over it still can you imagine
4647940 it was jan 20 1961 he placed his hand on the bible as everyone watched and took the oath in front of god and chief justice earl warren and there beside him was jackie oh jackie in that pillbox hat and that glorious oleg cassini masterpiece in greige wool melton she was a wonder
4647941 and then eight years later and largely owing to my own massive public appeal my wife will become president and i can be the prettiest first lady there ever was
4647942 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement
4647943 to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out
4647944 in fear for my life and what he might do
4647945 he indicated that he expected to be in there the church shooting people until the police arrived and that he fully expected to be killed by the responding police
4647946 some publicity in the recent past regarding its liberal stance on things
4647947 in the midst of political and religious controversy i choose to love my neighbors as myself
4647948 ultimately i believe that tolerance compassion and respect are the qualities we need to keep knoxville and east tennessee beautiful
4647949 stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of the major media outlets
4647950 when i got there they were already wrestling with him the gun was in the air somebody grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog piled him to the floor i knew a police suppression hold and i sat on him until police came
4647951 was a man who was hurt in the world and feeling that nothing was going his way
4647952 he turned the gun on people who were mostly likely to treat him lovingly and compassionately and be the ones to help someone in that situation
4647953 we hardly have enough lawyers to handle the serious violent cases and now were jamming up the entire system with marijuana cases
4647954 we never used to see this happen then all of a sudden every second and third marijuana offense starts coming in as a felony
4647955 if you want a recipe for bankrupting society you got it here in new orleans
4647956 you charge someone for smoking a joint clog up the time of attorneys juries and judges and then give them a 10 year sentence that will cost society 300 000 for keeping them in jail they cant catch murderers so they may as well go after dope smokers
4647957 this is a really bad business model where theres no sense of priority no sense of cost and no sense of a return on investment
4647958 rather the increase is a result of the fact that during 2008 it has become easier to obtain certified copies of prior convictions that are required evidence to prosecute second and third offense marijuana cases
4647959 this type of conviction can bring permanent damage to the entire life course of that individual
4647960 and when there is a high density of these types of marijuana convictions in one area it can do great harm to the community because you have people constantly going in and out of prison
4647961 unless im completely missing something here there is no crime control rationale for this kind of approach
4647962 he had resources set aside to send his older son to college this fall but now hes thinking about having to spend them on a lawyer so he can stay out of jail and continue to support his family
4647963 i dont understand why anyone would think marijuana possession should be a priority given everything else were dealing with but this is a convenient way of targeting a particular group of people its an easy arrest to make and these cases are difficult to defend its hard to prove you werent in possession of some marijuana that the police offer says you were
4647964 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
4647965 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
4647966 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
4647967 growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
4647968 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
4647969 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain
4647970 i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
4647971 the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users
4647972 we certainly dont know of any mechanism by which radiofrequency exposure would cause a cancerous effect in cells we just dont know this might possibly occur
4647973 if a person feels compelled that they should take precautions in reducing the amount of electromagnetic radio waves through their bodies by all means they should do so
4647974 but at the same time we have to remember theres no conclusive evidence that links cell phones to cancer whether its brain tumors or other forms of cancer
4647975 when you look at the overwhelming majority of studies that have been peer reviewed and published in scientific journals around the world youll find no relationship between wireless usage and adverse health affects
4647976 i dont want to get it brain cancer and i certainly dont want you to get it
4647977 the exact budget i will come up with but it will be somewhere between 600 000 and 750 000 with about a third of it going directly to the bush library
4647978 cheneys possible definitely the national security adviser stephen hadley definitely either dr rice or i think a meeting with dr rice or the deputy secretary john negroponte is possible
4647979 the main thing is that he the asian politician comes and hes well received that he meets with high level people and we send positive statements made back from the administration about this guy wasnt such a bad guy many people have done worse

4647989 why didnt the u s army help the african american people in new orleans when hurricane katrina hit
4647990 get a positive attitude of life and to rebuild their hometown
4647991 i felt great when our nation was in a disaster we can get the help even if they could not save any more lives we feel we are not alone
4647992 it was not a proper time to talk about this
4647993 i do not feel good when i hear people complaining that celebrities dont give enough
4647994 how could our country not consider enough especially for places like schools how could they not think about the children and hospitals if hospitals collapse where people go also the government do not consider the power station there was no power
4647995 overnight so many lives were lost realize that your relatives and your friends are more important than money do not hurt the feelings of your parents and your friends be more tolerant of each other get a happy life

4648004 you can pull those off and suck the juice out of them
4648005 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4648006 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4648007 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4648008 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4648009 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4648010 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4648011 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4648014 as an eyewitness to president fords decision i can tell you anne almost was chosen
4648015 anne was a beautiful accomplished young woman from new orleans with blue eyes with tight curls with a quick mind and a with good heart
4648016 the only thing frankly in greater danger than quail when anne was around was a glass ceiling
4648017 at a time when women in politics stuffed envelopes and made coffee she was a powerful influential figure
4648018 we probably tackle more than most people thats who we are but we think at the two week point its a good time to shut that part of it down
4648019 i really want to test the young kids on saturday
4648020 because theyre going to play roles for us you know and i want to see how they react in a game like situation
4648021 thats what today is about evaluating things youre doing well that you need to move forward with and things that you need work on
4648022 well move the ball some create situations coming off the goal line two minute offense end of the half plays end of the game plays
4648023 the price increase is necessary to cover the cost of doing business
4648024 the marketplace changes and you have to change your offerings
4648025 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition
4648026 market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases

4648053 a 170 check is not worth maine families being cold this winter if opponents of a special session to invest surplus funds into liheap are concerned with costs they should join republicans in support of saving the taxpayers over 31 000 each day a special session is held
4648054 the new numbers mark a big improvement for collins who had just a seven point lead and earned below 50 support from voters in july she now has her highest level of support since april incumbents who fail to break above 50 are generally viewed as vulnerable
4648055 a 170 check is not worth maine families being cold this winter if opponents of a special session to invest surplus funds into liheap are concerned with costs they should join republicans in support of saving the taxpayers over 31 000 each day a special session is held
4648056 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4648057 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things
4648058 to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4648059 the prison changes shape cells rearrange and reconfigure every night to disorient the prisoners from breaking out a transforming super prison
4648060 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
4648061 i heard a rumor somewhere that matt damon was in negotiations to star as ollie queen green arrow he certainly has the physicality and chops for the meaty role considering how bad ass damon was in the last bourne film
4648062 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
4648063 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4648064 we are worried that we are facing under the strong arm of russia a situation where some kind of understanding would be reached that russia would be given a free hand in the region
4648065 my husband had repeatedly warned our 3 boys about their behavior while playing the xbox tuesday after i arrived home from work our oldest son told me to look in the backyard at dads artwork well i wasnt surprised to see the xbox proudly displayed on the nearest tree way to go honey
4648066 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews

4648069 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has the russian federation as its aim
4648070 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4648071 the us is concerned with its own anti missile defence not polands but poland by deploying the shield will be exposed to attack
4648072 once again bigoted fringe author jerome corsi is trying to make money off of an election spinning garbage as journalism and relying on the right wing echo chamber to pump up sales
4648073 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal

4648076 ba o de humildad y de respetar la voluntad popular expresada en las urnas del pasado domingo
4648077 los resultados del referendo sobre todo de las autoridades ratificadas no debe ser motivo para que aumente su soberbia sino incrementar su humildad su esp ritu democr tico y eso significa apertura hacia el otro al adversario que no es igual que enemigo pol tico
4648078 el defensor del pueblo no tirar la toalla seguir abogando por el di logo y rechazar siempre la violencia
4648079 every great project needs to transform itself in order to excel and today we are starting that process
4648080 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4648081 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4648082 debemos manifestar que la polic a actu en cumplimiento de su rol constitucional para hacer respetar las leyes utilizando la fuerza racional y proporcional necesaria

4648089 i know in my heart all his friends who died with him were living their prayer
4648090 but for the way they had lived they were pretty jazzed and happy because they held the lines and they loved helicopter rides
4648091 you had the extraordinary gift of having these men in you lives

4648099 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4648100 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4648101 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4648102 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4648103 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4648104 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4648105 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4648106 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4648107 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4648108 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4648109 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated

4648113 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
4648114 they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
4648115 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different
4648116 im not going to play gotcha with one candidate and not with the other this way it will be totally fair you compare apples to apples
4648117 how do you like your steaks medium rare or well done
4648118 if you were a tree what kind of tree would you be
4648119 i saw many games in pre season and if you say only one or two teams can win it i think you are wrong
4648120 i saw a minimum of eight teams playing very well
4648121 it wont only be chelsea arsenal manchester united and liverpool not this season there are three or four other clubs who have good teams like tottenham and portsmouth who are strong teams
4648122 i saw manchester city in the uefa cup and just because they lost doesnt mean they are not a good team
4648123 all the games here are important and difficult games unlike in other leagues where you have two or three teams only and you win 15 out of 20 games
4648124 here you can never be sure you will win a game and that is exciting every week you have a new challenge
4648125 one week you will be playing a team like portsmouth who have a lot of tall players the next a team where everyone is fast england is different
4648126 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward he played well in the friendly games but he is quiet
4648127 if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if you dont he wont say anything because he is quiet
4648128 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
4648129 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
4648130 i had some opportunities to sell players but they wouldnt go
4648131 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really
4648132 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4648133 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4648134 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4648135 the arrangements that the united states makes with its polish allies to make sure that poland is capable of defending itself and capable of being an active ally are frankly between poland and the united states
4648136 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4648137 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4648138 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4648139 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4648140 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4648141 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4648142 every one of russias neighbors feels less secure today than it did a week ago this is going to mean that theyre going to want help from the outside
4648143 a greater western military presence in the region is not something russia wanted but by its own actions russia has forced this to happen now and the west will respond to this
4648144 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4648145 the g d of all comfort who comports us in all our sorrows
4648146 so that we may encourage and comfort those who share in our suffering

4648171 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4648172 our expanded research effort has led to several significant strides in the development of cellulosic ethanol technology at the lab scale in recent months
4648173 in the past few months our scientists have been able to achieve significant ethanol percentages in fermentation and improve the yield of ethanol from biomass additionally in our work with farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers we had a very successful harvest of corn cobs last fall and anticipate further advances during an expanded harvest this fall
4648174 there is a realistic prospect of obtaining additional working capital and we believe managements roadmap toward resolving this liquidity crisis by year end is credible therefore at this point we do not foresee bankruptcy or some other drastic outcome

4648180 opportunity for alice jut being there on peters farm to reinforce west marin as an epicenter of slow food
4648181 i always say a gastronome who isnt an environmentalist is just stupid and i say an environmentalist who isnt a gastronome is just sad
4648182 they are recognizing the value of local sustainable food organic farming and it highlights what our region is doing
4648183 we love the whole idea of local food and making local product
4648184 marin of course is one of the counties that will exemplify that
4648185 for me slow food nation represents a bit of a breaking point for me with slow food i either walk away invigorated that people are trying to do the right thing or pissed off that while the cloud high intentions of slow food are sound but the way in which they are chased makes them unobtainable to all but the wealthy
4648186 i do okay in life but even i think that the pricing on the events with each one costing money means that most people are unable to attend
4648187 i think that this occasion will be a marked change
4648188 its like the first day of spring which is not always sunny but even then holds a sense that spring is coming

4648190 its great to see some innovative new plastics being released

4648210 we have lost the relative strength and security that the old moral codes guaranteed our loves either by forbidding them or determining their limits under the crossfire of gynecological surgery rooms and television screens we have buried love within shame for the benefit of pleasure desire if not revolution evolution planning management hence for the benefit of politics until we discover under the rubble of those ideological structures which are nevertheless ambitious often exorbitant sometimes altruistic that they were extravagant or shy attempts intended to quench a thirst for love to recognize this does not amount to a modest withdrawal it is perhaps to confess to a grandiose pretension love is the time and space in which i assumes the right to be extraordinary sovereign yet not individual divisible lost annihilated but also and through imaginary fusion with the loved one equal to the infinite space of superhuman psychism paranoid i am in love at the zenith of subjectivity
4648211 it didnt feel sexual as i would now define that it felt more about wanting freedom i didnt want to grow up and be a wife and it seemed to me that the beatles had the kind of freedom i wanted no rules they could spend two days lying in bed they ran around on motorbikes ate from room service i didnt want to sleep with paul mccartney i was too young but i wanted to be like them something larger than life

4648246 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4648247 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4648248 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas

4648254 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4648255 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4648256 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4648257 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4648258 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4648259 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4648260 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4648261 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4648262 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4648263 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4648264 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4648265 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4648266 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4648267 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

4648271 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4648272 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4648273 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4648274 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4648275 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4648277 this is a strong statement that shell is committed to accelerating the development of cellulosic ethanol in collaboration with iogen we have come a long way together already on this particular technology pathway for sustainable biofuel and we will be working ever closer to meet the technical and commercial challenges facing larger scale production

4648281 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4648282 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4648283 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4648284 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4648285 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4648286 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4648287 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4648288 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4648289 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4648290 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4648298 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4648299 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4648300 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4648301 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4648302 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4648303 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4648304 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4648305 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4648306 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4648307 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4648308 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4648309 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4648310 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4648311 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4648312 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4648313 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4648314 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4648315 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4648316 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4648317 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4648318 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4648319 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4648320 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4648321 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4648322 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4648323 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4648324 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4648325 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4648326 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4648327 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4648328 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4648329 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4648330 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4648331 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4648332 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4648333 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4648334 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4648335 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4648336 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4648337 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4648338 douglas amp friends but alas no recordings of that fun has surfaced
4648339 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4648340 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4648341 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4648342 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4648343 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4648344 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4648345 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4648346 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4648347 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4648348 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4648349 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4648350 we really arent sure how to get to the bottom of this thing
4648351 it seems like as soon as we clear up one player theres another right behind him
4648352 i have some friends back east that have been through this sort of thing you just have to be careful when youre back there

4648356 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
4648357 there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the welfare of children is in real jeopardy
4648358 it is disappointing to see howard dean trying to use gender and race to divide voters his comments are insulting inappropriate and have no place in this election
4648359 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party

4648394 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4648395 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4648396 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4648427 both have worked tirelessly for years to increase participation by previously underrepresented groups in our activity
4648428 i think that these two agree far more than they disagree about issues concerning the community and this seems to be just a small disagreement about differing strategies to reach the same end
4648429 unfortunately the way that the argument progressed both said and or did things that offend the taste of some people
4648430 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4648493 lists by age group in its table 1 the numbers of recorded deaths and the death rates per 100 000 for the ten leading causes of death in each group
4648494 numbers of deaths from the vital statistics system represent complete counts therefore they are not subject to sampling error
4648495 cases of hiv infection and aids in the united states and dependent areas 2006
4648496 these numbers do not represent reported case counts rather these numbers are point estimates which result from adjustments of reported case counts the reported case counts have been adjusted for reporting delays and for redistribution of cases in persons initially reported without an identified risk factor but not for incomplete reporting
4648497 tabulations of deaths of persons with aids table 7 do not reflect actual counts of deaths reported to the surveillance system rather the estimates are based on numbers of reported deaths which have been adjusted for delays in reporting
4648498 data are presented for cases of hiv infection and aids reported to cdc through june 2007 all data are provisional
4648499 the population denominators used to compute these rates for the 50 states and the district of columbia were based on official postcensus estimates for 2006 from the u s census bureau 24 and bridged race estimates for 2006 obtained from the national center for health statistics 25

4648502 come and meet my wife and family and discuss what we are doing in russia
4648503 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4648504 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4648505 hes got a fractured spine well not a fractured spine i said that wrong he has a hairline fracture so hes out for the year

4648509 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask

4648515 they said it was no good because it wasnt registered at the courthouse
4648516 theres more than enough proof that i am an american i have served
4648517 i was good enough to be sent off to war twice

4648519 this is from 2001 i have been after this stuff
4648520 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4648521 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4648522 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4648523 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4648524 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families
4648525 we prepare for war why not prepare for the consequences of the war
4648526 in the past we thought if a marine had post traumatic stress disorder he was gone now its more like breaking a leg
4648527 the good news is that while we started out not thinking too much about ptsd now we are thinking about a lot
4648528 some marines have bad habits and turn to alcohol others turn to drugs its definitely on the rise
4648529 we need them badly the fighting is not going to end anytime soon and we need to take care of our marines
4648530 i dont think this is the silver bullet but it will get some people to step up for help and that is what we need
4648531 we prepare for war why not prepare for the consequences of the war
4648532 finally on the right track before they wouldnt even recognize that there was a problem
4648533 for the vast majority of marine warriors these are anticipated brief responses to combat and operational stress
4648534 it is the leaders responsibility for making sure marines get help
4648535 its our job to restore marines to the extent we can by reducing the stigma
4648536 with a giant franchise like harry potter in the market we had to stay clear of it
4648537 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4648538 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time

4648541 we probably tackle more than most people thats who we are but we think at the two week point its a good time to shut that part of it down
4648542 i really want to test the young kids on saturday
4648543 because theyre going to play roles for us you know and i want to see how they react in a game like situation
4648544 thats what today is about evaluating things youre doing well that you need to move forward with and things that you need work on
4648545 well move the ball some create situations coming off the goal line two minute offense end of the half plays end of the game plays
4648546 dockerys not 100 percent and i dont want to run emily into the ground
4648547 well have six healthy players but a lot of those kids need game time and game experience its a great opportunity for them to get better
4648548 hopefully it will be 100 percent eventually but it might linger a while but its not so bad i cant play ill do what i have to do
4648549 im doing okay now and yes i have to go to checkups with the surgeon and have appointments for prosthetic replacements since ive not received the award i have past medical bills its not a jackpot life is not like since before it happened
4648550 as far as music i thought id never again write songs i was sure i had post traumatic stress
4648551 it took me thirty years and i thought i was on the path i had found my profession i found my gift who would have thunk it
4648552 its just unbelievable people have been hurt before me but it becomes fairly obvious that this basically is being used as a case for preemption its so obvious wyeth needs to do the right thing so this cant happen to anyone else now they want to not be held accountable its such a complex issue id be surprised if you go to a town an hour away and ask people about preemption they wouldnt know when you put it in a simple sentence people say oh my god this affects me
4648553 what i try to say is a drug company was really looking to shield themselves from being sued because of frivolous lawsuits they see written about in the paper and people fear
4648554 federal preemption is a device drug makers have come up with to hide behind the apron strings of the fda and shield themselves from being sued instead of using money to help the situation they buy more advertising
4648555 yes of course all the label had to say was under no circumstances should the drug be administered with an iv push
4648556 now the choices are between lawful evil and chaotic evil which usually translates to either enslaving the population or all out scorched earth
4648557 this is not the marines this is the big brother house

4648590 car makers dont need to pay for their health insurance so even now that the canadian dollar is the same as usd big3 still comes out ahead making cars there thats wut u get when u have a 1st world spending economy and a 3rd world health system

4648593 the motor vehicle safety act allows for the importation of vehicles sold at the retail level in the united states that are not in full compliance with canadian safety standards provided the vehicles were originally manufactured to comply with all applicable federal safety standards of the united states canadian gazzette
4648594 to protect the safety equipment of the vehicle such as the lights from damage in a low speed collision prevent or reduce physical damage to the front and rear of passenger cars in low speed collisions while protecting the hood trunk grill fuel exhaust and cooling systems as well as safety related equipment such as parking lights headlamps and tail lamps in low speed collisions
4648595 it is now impossible to determine if the unique canadian test speeds provide any safety benefit as there are over 370 pedestrian fatalities per year a significant portion of the 2 900 fatalities per year on canadian roads it is proposed that it is time to refocus road safety efforts away from higher test speeds aimed to protect the vehicle safety systems and to begin to facilitate future pedestrian safety designs

4648607 the success of the bush regimes propaganda lies and deception with gullible and inattentive americans since 9 11 has made it difficult for intelligent aware people to be optimistic about the future of the united states for almost 8 years the us media has served as ministry of propaganda for a war criminal regime americans incapable of thinking for themselves reading between the lines or accessing foreign media on the internet have been brainwashed

4648639 we confide in our once again alonzo i have gotten further with my brick wall why do you have to approve of my case im answering to kal el and mig why we do put much attention to men because men are created to lead the not only is snowbama dishonest he is dangerously ignorant
4648640 there is no such thing as a jewish race but there is a lot of jewish bullshit
4648641 you try it if you dont like it you dont have to eat it but this is not a restaurant i am not a cook or waitress i am a mom and a teacher
4648642 perpetrate a fraud for the direct personal benefit of kbr
4648643 our main focus is that kbr is taking american folks telling them that everyone theyll be working with is skilled that everyones trained
4648644 then they get to iraq and theres no training no experience people that speak no english thats what caused the direct issue here
4648645 recover disabled vehicles including tanks personnel carriers jeeps cars and trucks
4648646 often had to correct the instructor to prevent the teaching of improper practices
4648647 that kbrs practices were getting people killed mr rock cautioned mr coffey that he should keep his mouth shut and not continue to inform others about his safety concerns
4648648 had been a truck driver in kenya and had had experience with wreckers
4648649 thus when mr coffey told david to move the wrecker equipment in a certain direction david did exactly the opposite
4648650 mangled such that even after multiple treatments and surgery he does not have use of his finger
4648651 were not alleging claims for putting people into war zones getting raped things like that
4648652 our claims are specifically for americans put into situations where they were put at risk by lack of training and the failure of their supervisors to handle that issue
4648653 if kbr tortiously guaranteed safety when it knew there was no such safety it may be liable for resulting injuries despite that the immediate causes were determined attackers that could not be thwarted by the best efforts of american defenders
4648654 there are constitutional as well as practical considerations that may prevent judicial resolution
4648655 it appears though that these tort based claims of civilian employees against their civilian employers can be separated from the political questions that loom so large in the background
4648656 i represented him in a case against fayette county over some signs hed put in his yard
4648657 we obtained some permits from the county got some attorneys paid got some damages for mr coffey

4648661 i was the lion who forced you to join with aravis i was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead i was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept i was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear for the last mile so that you should reach king lune in time and i was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay a child near death so that it came to shore where a man sat wakeful at midnight to receive you
4648662 i am telling you your story not hers faith said
4648663 i believe that one of the gifts of growing older is realizing what a small part we play in the drama of life looking back i see that i was much more burdened when i thought my circumstances were more important
4648664 were done were done with the firsts he is the last of our children to ever learn to walk

4648673 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4648674 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read
4648675 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4648676 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4648677 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4648678 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4648679 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good

4648693 senator obamas view is that we need to review all aspects of our bilateral and multilateral arrangements with russia in order to assess where they ought to go from here
4648694 if russia is going to take the position that not only is it not interested in integrating in that fashion but it is not going to allow its supposedly sovereign and independent neighbors to do so that calls into doubt the entire premise of us european and western with russia
4648695 i dont think there is much difference between the candidates on this question and its going to be a huge challenge for the next administration
4648696 a mccain administration would be directly and overtly adversarial to russia but i think that you can overstate the differences between the two candidates on this subject
4648697 the russian government desperately wants the west to treat it as an important and respected great power

4648786 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4648787 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4648788 it started as a gamble by georgia the former soviet republic and darling of the west move quickly into the breakaway pro russian enclave called south ossetia and take back what is legally georgias but the plan failed instead russian forces invaded georgia last week and crushed georgian resistance according to u s military officials russia is out to decimate the u s trained georgian armed forces
4648789 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4648790 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4648791 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4648792 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4648793 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4648794 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4648795 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4648796 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4648797 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4648798 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty

4648891 from time to time rumors circulate that thimerosal a mercury based preservative once used in several vaccines and still used in some flu vaccine could contribute to asds however valid scientific studies have shown there is no link the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the cdc and the institute of medicine iom agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism
4648892 the author concludes that recent studies have found no association between mmr vaccination and autism the frequent embryologic neuroanatomic abnormalities found in children with autism lessen the likelihood that mmr immunization is a major risk factor the immunization safety review committee of the institute of medicine and a special american academy of pediatrics panel have concluded that evidence does not support mmr immunization as a risk factor for autism
4648893 on may 18th 2004 the institute of medicine iom released its eighth and final report from its immunization safety review committee based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological studies neither the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine are associated with autism says the new report furthermore the hypotheses regarding how the mmr vaccine and thimerosal could trigger autism lack supporting evidence and are theoretical only further research to find the cause of autism should be directed toward other lines of inquiry that are supported by current knowledge and evidence and offer more promise for providing an answer said the committee that wrote the report the american medical association ama lauds the process that went into the creation of this scientific report and applauds the iom and the cdc for their strong efforts in continuing to ensure the safety of the vaccines that are administered in the united states through post market surveillance and studies such as this
4648894 some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal from the addition of important new vaccines recommended for children explains the higher prevalence in recent years
4648895 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism

4649009 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
4649010 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
4649011 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4649012 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
4649013 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
4649014 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
4649015 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
4649016 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe

4649022 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity

4649024 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
4649025 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

4649032 while im not going to comment about those specific allegations its my view that anyone who is illegally involved in diverting water in the murray darling system during this crisis is engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of australia
4649033 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place

4649064 nem sempre aconteceu mas sinto que essa rela o de confian a e cumplicidade entre as duas magistraturas j me prejudicou enquanto advogado de uma das partes
4649065 em termos ideais deveria ser assim em instala es separadas mas talvez por quest es de restri es or amentais isso n o seja poss vel
4649066 distanciar esses servi os de forma a que acusa o mp e defesa advogados estejam numa posi o de igualdade que passa pela equidist ncia entre mp e ju zes que s o quem decide os processos
4649067 os advogados sentem alguma perplexidade pela proximidade que existe entre as duas magistraturas que nada t m a ver uma com a outra
4649068 uma situa o que me incomoda porque cria rela es de natureza subjectiva entre as magistraturas excluindo os advogados j tropecei muitas vezes em situa es dessas na minha vida profissional

4649100 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
4649101 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
4649102 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
4649103 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
4649104 dont miss what could be the opportunity of a lifetime to get into the home of your dreams
4649105 the nations home builders are confident that a new temporary 7 500 tax credit for first time home buyers will get buyers back into the marketplace and help end the current cyclical downturn in the housing industry
4649106 if someone knocked on your door and said hey i have 7 500 to lend you at zero percent interest and you can pay me back over 15 years would you take the money
4649107 probably not unless i had something specifically i needed the money for
4649108 when you point out that this is debt no matter how you slice it and that you are responsible for that debt i see it another way

4649232 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen

4649246 project eagles dynamically sculptured form and dramatic proportions communicate visual drama speed and agility even when the car is standing still sportscars are primarily an emotional rather than a rational purchase and so the design must seduce with its beauty and distinctive character however the modern customer also demands that the product offers real world usability as well as exotic imagery therefore every element of the cars exterior and interior has been carefully designed to create a product that offers comfort and convenience as well as traditional performance car attributes
4649247 we recognise that touch not only assists with driving enjoyment but also conveys messages about quality and therefore great attention has been paid to all the areas where the driver interfaces with the car

4649281 the bulldogs have been honest open and transparent in these discussions with sonny bill williams and his management
4649282 its not ideal but the big issue for us was obtaining the injunction and the fact that he complied with it by not playing then entering into negotiations with the bulldogs

4649465 for the first time in the history of our company the turbo six and v8 engines were designed in parallel ford performance vehicles general manager rod barrett said
4649466 power and torque have increased across both engines while improvements to engine refinement and fuel efficiency are also key components of the new fg range
4649467 as a result the car accelerates faster while also feeling lighter and more powerful
4649468 revised fifth and sixth gear ratios on all manual transmissions has improved nvh and highway cruise efficiency via the reduced engine speed for a given road speed in those gears
4649469 also included in the range of developments on the new manual transmission is a new synchroniser package which provides improved shift precision and shift feel and reduced shift effort and travel

4649517 we havent grown any substantial areas really since 2003 and thats been the case right across the industry id say except for those that have got bore water
4649518 most cotton growers are now pretty much dry land farmers
4649519 and by that i mean they rely on rain to grow crops like wheat and canola and chickpeas and those sort of things instead of irrigated cotton
4649520 per litre of water we produce more cotton here than anywhere else in the world
4649521 and the latest technology weve seen water use efficiency really move over the last few decades and we believe we can double the water use efficiency through you know r and d research and development in the next decade
4649522 what we need is to let the market determine what crops are grown and focus on getting water policy right
4649523 if cotton farmers think that theres no future in cotton they will sell the water and get out it
4649524 they know whats going on and they know the risks theyre taking

4649564 i didnt assume that whatever bob joseph and i agreed upon was going right into the presidents desk in the oval office

4649572 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4649573 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4649574 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4649575 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4649576 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4649577 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4649578 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4649579 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4649580 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4649581 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4649582 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4649583 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4649584 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4649585 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4649586 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4649587 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4649588 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4649589 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4649590 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4649591 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4649592 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4649593 usr local lib python2 5 site packages trac trac env
4649594 i promised marco to hand over control of 67 159 45 96 by tomorrow at the very latest and this is the only way i can see to do that i would appreciate it
4649595 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4649596 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4649597 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4649598 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4649599 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4649600 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4649601 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4649602 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4649603 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4649604 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4649605 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4649606 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4649607 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4649608 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4649609 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4649610 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4649611 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4649612 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4649613 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4649614 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4649615 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4649616 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4649617 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4649618 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4649619 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4649620 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4649621 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4649622 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4649623 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4649624 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4649625 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4649626 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4649627 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4649628 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4649629 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4649630 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4649631 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4649632 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4649633 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4649634 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4649635 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4649636 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4649637 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4649638 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4649639 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4649640 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4649641 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4649642 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe

4649647 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4649648 esencial que ee uu y otros pa ses libres garanticen que una democracia asediada permanezca soberana segura y unida
4649649 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4649650 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4649651 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4649652 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4649653 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4649654 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4649655 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4649656 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4649657 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4649658 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4649659 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4649660 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4649661 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4649662 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4649663 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4649664 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4649665 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4649666 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4649667 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4649668 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4649669 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4649670 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4649671 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4649672 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4649673 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4649674 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4649675 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4649676 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4649677 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4649678 we raised the issue with carlsberg as soon as we became aware of it
4649679 we held talks at the highest level with carlsberg and are delighted they have responded in the right way so promptly
4649680 carlsberg apologises for any offence caused by the planned free pint promotion in the sun
4649681 it is never easy for a new player to come into a new team especially if the team does not play well
4649682 i was pleased with the way dossena and keane worked against standard liege but i know that they will both play better
4649683 they are both players with quality and they are both internationals so i am sure that they will improve
4649684 sometimes a player can come into a team and do well straight away but usually they need time to adjust
4649685 hes been not only part of the national team programme but hes been a part of major league soccer from early on so the ability to talk to him about what were going through here and get his advice and input is invaluable
4649686 wed be honoured and privileged if bruce was part of the organisation but the conversation was really geared toward his input and his feeling on what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4649687 todays launch was the culmination of tremendous teamwork by nasa ula and the air force to ensure that glast received a safe and accurate ride to orbit

4649689 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4649690 i could have played a safe pitch out third shot to about 15 feet but i had momentum with me and it wasnt that hard a shot
4649691 i chunked it in the bunker and then didnt get up and down but it was nice to come back with birdies on 16 and 17 to end the round on a good note
4649692 i was close last time and i kept looking at the rankings so im trying to forget about it
4649693 i would love to play in it but im just trying to play well here and if i play well it will take care of itself its not like ive done anything spectacular
4649694 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too and i couldnt get a full head of steam
4649695 sixteen years ago the democratic party refused to allow robert p casey sr then the governor of pennsylvania to speak at its national convention because his anti abortion views stemming from his roman catholic faith clashed with the partys platform and powerful constituencies
4649696 the late pennsylvania gov robert p casey was not given a marquee speaking spot at the 1992 convention because of his anti abortion views
4649697 casey was denied a prime speaking spot at the 1992 convention because of his opposition to abortion rights
4649698 anyone who is speaking at the convention will have endorsed governor clinton by the time of the convention and governor casey has not

4649737 whomever the democrats nominate they would govern this country in a way that will in my opinion take this country backward to the days when government felt empowered to take from us our freedom to decide for ourselves the course and the quality of our lives
4649738 within the same paragraph as the aforementioned quotation mccain inadvertantly demonstrated the contradictions between the old republican palaver about freedom and the demands of the war on terror saying it is shameful and dangerous that senate democrats are blocking an extention of surveillance powers no line got louder applause

4649762 i am pleased to deliver good news from the front lines of climate change research
4649763 our latest research results which i am about to describe could have an enormous impact on policy decisions regarding greenhouse gas emissions despite decades of persistent uncertainty over how sensitive the climate system is to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels we now have new satellite evidence which strongly suggests that the climate system is much less sensitive than is claimed by the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change the warming we have experience in the last 100 years is mostly natural
4649764 if climate change is mostly natural then it is largely out of our control and is likely to end if it has not ended already since satellite measured global temperatures have not warmed for at least seven years now

4649788 and here i must point out that the islaamic state of iraaq is one of those movements with a pristine methodology and clear vision which at an early stage declared its observance of shari legal constants in fighting and politics and stated the bitter truth which others fear to speak thus our brothers the mujaahideen mustnt adopt programs and methodologies which conflict with the fundamentals of the shariah or help the enemies of the caliphate to delay or prevent its establishment so for example the methodologies of the jihaadee movements must be founded on the rule of the shariah not the rule of the majority they must be founded on an emphasis on the brotherhood of islaam as the bond between muslims thus everyone who aids the jihaad and mujaahideen iraaqi or otherwise is from the mujaahideen in iraaq for him is what is for them and upon him is what is upon them and everyone who is hostile to islaam and the jihaad and aids the global crusade against the muslims isnt from the mujaahideen even if he be iraaqi they must emphasize the serious effort to set up the caliphate state which is by consensus an unchanging demand of the shariah they must emphasize the liberation of the muslims homelands from the occupiers particularly palestine the arabian peninsula and every muslim land occupied by the kuffaar this is the individual obligation of every muslim since the fall of spain and the martyr of islaam shaykh abd allah azzaam may allah have mercy upon him used to implore and reiterate and his heart would ooze pain as he defended this genuine fundamental of the shariah and they must emphasize refusal to recognize the legitimacy of all the governments which the international system recognizes in our islaamic world for they are regimes outside the fold of islaam which rule by other than what allah sent down and many of them are allied to the enemies of islaam the matter is extremely clear all governments which are recognized by the international community rule by other than what allah sent down and comply with the resolutions and charters of the united nations and many of them are allied with the crusader and jewish enemies of islaam against the muslims and i challenge those who cast doubt on that to bring me one government recognized by the international community which fits the requirements of dar al islaam is it the saudi state or jordan or egypt or pakistan or who theyre apostate governments outside the fold of the shariah for one or more reasons but their populations are muslim and are being repressed by these regimes

4649845 want to make sure mccains mind is clear hes a tough guy hes served his country and paid his dues hes john mccain but that merits a closer look the big question in this race is is he competent
