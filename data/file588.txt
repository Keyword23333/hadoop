5880012 we as a club have been simply amazed by the work ethic mark has showcased since joining our playing group and cannot speak highly enough of the overwhelmingly positive effect his presence has had on our squad and our club
5880013 it has been a feature of our recruitment history to repatriate australias finest football exports and with mark on board we have continued this tradition and very happily and willingly provided a well deserved opportunity for one of the greats of the australian game to contribute to this most exciting time for football in this country

5880141 civilian control of the military is both a very good thing and in some sense a very unnatural one if you think of it its odd that the group of people whose job it is to fight and die in defense of the nation would accept the idea that someone other than themselves should decide what defending the nation requires and thus when they should have to risk their lives and prepare to mourn the death of their comrades but precisely because its so odd the fact that in our society they do this seems to me to be a truly wonderful thing and when soldiers do go off to fight and die on orders from the civilian leadership the knowledge that they do this oddly enough on our say so makes me greatly admire them it also makes me profoundly unwilling to hold them responsible for any problems with the policy they are carrying out since it is our civilian leaders not the troops on the ground who decide what that policy is but for precisely this reason i think that it is incumbent on each of us to think very seriously about who we elect to be those leaders and to debate openly and seriously any wars they might propose civilian control of the military only works when that control is exercised responsibly it is the responsibility of people like the president and members of congress not to send our troops off to war lightly just as it is their responsibility not lightly to dismiss threats to our nation but it is also our job as citizens to do whatever we can to make sure that they live up to those responsibilities because this is how i think about these things i think its clear that we should support the troops both materially by giving them what they need both to fight and survive and also to make a good life when they return and emotionally by being behind them but because i think that supporting them also requires that we think as clearly as we can about when to go to war i dont think that supporting them can possibly require supporting the war they fight in if its a just and wise war we should support it for those reasons if not we should oppose it in either case we support the troops best by trying as hard as we can to be good and thoughtful citizens especially when it comes to war
5880142 i have no use for the support of people who uncritically assume that since were at war its their duty to support it in order to help the troops
5880143 please note that my own position on the war remains one of principled uncertainty

5880171 a story from the life of buddha himself found in the sutra of forty two sections buddha was walking along one day when he happened to encounter somebody probably a brahmin but we dont know who for some reason wasnt very pleased with the buddha and immediately started to call him all sorts of names so the man stood there for a while abusing the buddha with all the offensive words in his vocabulary but the buddha didnt say anything he just waited for the man to stop speaking and eventually the man did dry up perhaps he ran out of breath the buddha quietly said is that all rather taken aback the man said yes that is all the buddha then said let me ask you a question suppose one day a friend brings you a present but you dont want to accept it if you dont accept it to whom does it belong the man said well if i wont accept it it belongs to the person who is trying to give it to me so the buddha said well you have tried to make a present of your abuse but i decline to accept it take it it belongs to you of course few of us would be capable of such a measured response

5880182 every summer the queen hosts her family her sisters and their husbands and children and grandchildren

5880184 when the press show up at this event there is no frederik and mary when the queen is asked why theyre not there she says they are stuck in traffic
5880185 clearly what happened was that frederik and mary decided to boycott this event because the editor went ahead and published these pictures
5880186 it would have been tempting but its not the case the two incidents had nothing to do with each other

5880215 it is now clear why barack obama has refused john mccains offer of joint town hall appearances during the fall campaign
5880216 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5880217 torture may well be enabling future attacks false confessions and an avalanche of misinformation since 9 11 compromised prosecutions allowed other culprits to escape and sent the american military on wild goose chases
5880218 border guards concrete barriers and earthen levees not only prove inadequate but act as force multipliers producing automated bungling that transform isolated events and singular attacks into global disasters
5880219 ask if such mega catastrophes are no longer an exception but part of densely networked systems that defy national management

5880236 at saddleback church i immediately thought that this would be a home run for obama outside of the fact that obama and warren were friendly
5880237 concert this very contrast is the main reason why i thought that obama could win over some of those evangelical fence sitters whose world view and political ideology isnt completely grounded in roe v wade
5880238 so he couldnt hear the exact same questions that he was asking barack obama
5880239 signal that he gave to barack obama was set up caught slipping because he decided to challenge someone to a fight in their own backyard and because i was wrong in my initial assessment im still sporting some timberland ridge on the back of my ass as well
5880240 depicting him as a crypto muslim who wants to snack on white babies was true or not

5880249 we believe that applieds state of the art wafering systems including its hct wire saws and squarers are the best choice to help us scale up capacity to meet the expanding global demand for wafers
5880250 we have used hct wire saws since the beginning of our manufacturing operations in 2006 and they have continued to demonstrate the performance necessary to deliver high quality cost effective wafers to our customers
5880251 we had a tremendous response from many highly qualified solar installation companies
5880252 this first phase of 1bog has been very encouraging and ultimately validates the community purchase model our decision to go with real goods solar came after a thorough selection process that covered a variety of areas real goods solar scored high in each of the key areas
5880253 we also wanted to make sure we selected a partner that was capable of moving rapidly so our members could benefit from the maximum potential rebates and solar incentives before they decline or expire
5880254 we are looking forward to working closely with real goods solar to build a strong foundation that will benefit the community and the industry at large
5880255 this installation at denver international airport fits with our greenprint denver action agenda for sustainability and our pledge to do all that we can to reduce our carbon footprint
5880256 we are proud to have such a large and prominently placed solar power system at dia this installation is both a symbol and a practical example of the citys commitment to renewable energy
5880257 dia has a long standing commitment to sustainable operations and environmental protection this project makes a visible environmental statement to the millions of passengers that travel through our airport
5880258 we are delighted that such a major metropolitan airport as denver international has embarked on a solar energy system that is as impressive in scope as this two megawatt installation which is the equivalent in size to seven football fields in addition our expertise in designing and installing commercial scale solar systems enabled us to address the complex power needs of a major transportation hub like denver international
5880259 by securing power through a power purchase agreement rather than major capital investment dia will benefit from a renewable energy system that is cost effective from its very first day of operation and for years to come
5880260 our collaborative effort serves as an example of how successful public private partnerships can help municipal facilities make the most of tax credits and other incentives available for solar energy
5880261 as a leading global solar provider sharp is proud to be part of this tremendous effort to help denver achieve its ambitious sustainability goals this solar pv system will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions electricity costs and grid constraints while helping to improve denvers air quality and the regions overall environment
5880262 this project is right in line with the clean energy future we envision at xcel energy
5880263 we were pleased to play a role in helping denver and colorado meet the ambitious goals its leaders have set with the renewable energy standard and greenprint denver

5880265 in our view any house member who goes to a party that honors a member or a group of members is violating the ethics rules
5880266 its a violation of the spirit the language and the meaning of the provisions

5880268 the rules they lay out are what we abide by

5880273 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5880274 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5880275 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
5880276 we achieved significant growth and exceeded our targeted output for the quarter as we continued to execute our growth strategies
5880277 we experienced strong market demand for our wafer products and successfully extended our customer base by entering into a number of wafer sales contracts during the quarter
5880278 we are excited about the results from our operational and r amp d efforts by the end of the quarter our annualized production capacity reached 450 mw and it remains on track to achieve the targeted capacity of 645 mw by the end of the year we continued to improve our production efficiency by further reducing our average silicon consumption rate to 6 24 grams per watt in the second quarter of 2008 from 6 3 grams per watt in the previous quarter in addition with a strong focus on r amp d we made significant advancements in the utilization of alternative silicon materials for future wafer production including the use of metallurgical grade silicon
5880279 we completed our equity follow on offering in june 2008 generating net proceeds of approximately us 185 2 million the additional funding provides renesola with sufficient cash sources to fund our 2009 expansion plan

5880285 ik vind dat n van de tegenstrijdigheden van de psychiatrie dat mensen die enorm lijden bij elkaar worden gezet en dat we vervolgens verwachten dat ze daar beter van worden
5880286 ik was 10 jaar opgenomen geweest en toen zei ik n keer dat ik wel zelfstandig wilde wonen en voor ik het wist was ik in mijn eigen huisje gestopt met nauwelijks nazorg
5880287 er werd in die tijd alleen gekeken of iemand zich waste en genoeg at en dronk niet hoe het geestelijk met iemand ging
5880288 vroeger waren we met vijf of soms vier hulpverleners als er dan een moeilijke cli nt is dan is het overleven dan is de werkdruk enorm en komen er incidenteel ook onverantwoorde riskante situaties voor ook komt het voor dat een pati nt gesepareerd wordt terwijl dat met een volwaardig team niet had gehoeven
5880289 het is logisch als je genoeg personeel aanwezig hebt zie je eerder de signalen dat het niet goed met iemand gaat je ziet de druk opbouwen en kan je eerder ingrijpen zodat separeren niet altijd meer nodig is
5880290 er is veel meer nodig om c zoals een moeilijke pati nt die eigenlijk naar de logopediste zou moeten dat gebeurt dan niet
5880291 er is ook meer misbruik van macht door de hulpverleners door de werkdruk
5880292 doordat we meer personeel hebben is er zeker het laatste jaar minder aggressie en minder geweld
5880293 vroeger kon scholing in de baas zn tijd nu is het neem maar vrij
5880294 er is vaak te weinig begeleiding op de beschermde woonvorm het is alsof je tegen de vrouw van een kankerpatient zegt hier heb je een kotsbakje je red het wel thuis he maar dat gebeurt wel met patienten met schizofrenie wat een ongeneeslijke ziekte is
5880295 de keerzijde van vermaatschappelijking van de zorg is de psychotische zwerver op straat
5880296 vroeger ging je deur op slot als je iets niet deed dat mag niet meer het opkomen voor mensenrechten vind ik heel goed maar er is niets voor in de plaats gekomen soms verkommeren patienten word je aan je lot overgelaten dan komt het voor dat iemand een week niet doucht die zou in bescherming genomen moeten worden
5880297 als het slechter met de economie gaat en er minder geld is komt de nadruk te liggen op korte termijn scoren de psychiatrie verzakelijkt wordt harder armer de overlast moet verholpen worden op de meest goedkope snelle manier en dat is een pil erin dat krijgt het accent in plaats van psycho therapie etc

5880299 dingen zijn niet altijd te bewijzen hoe meet je het resultaat van een goed gesprek we moeten niet toe naar een situatie zoals in de thuiszorg daar heeft een werknemer precies 4 minuten om steunkousen aan te trekken terwijl de cli nt al klaar staat met koffie en koekjes want de thuiszorgmedewerker is de enige die ze de hele dag ziet
5880300 het is vreselijk om iemand een halfjaar lang knetterpsychotisch te zien en niets te kunnen doen
5880301 schizofrenie is de meest invaliderende psychische ziekte die er is iemand die verstandelijk gehandicapt is heeft meer mogelijkheden op een zelfstandig bestaan dan iemand met schizofrenie maar toch is het budget voor verstandelijk gehandicapten in den haag even groot als dat voor psychotische mensen in heel nederland in beschermde woonvormen zitten mensen vaak in een klein kamertje weg te kwijnen
5880302 de gemeente capelle heeft geen cent te makken maar het gevaar bestaat wel dat we zo afhankelijk worden van de zorgkantoren en van de gemeente de zorgkantoren krijgen steeds meer macht
5880303 ik zou willen dat we niet alleen doen wat moet maar verder kunnen kijken effe naar het strand ruimte voor een lang gesprek pati nten weerbaarder maken
5880304 met zes man hebben we genoeg om de afdeling te bedruipen maar niet voor die extra dingen zoals een keer naar het strand gaan daar is heel weining ruimte voor
5880305 je ziet de individualisering ouders broers je buurvrouw hebben minder tijd iedreen is zo op zichzelf gericht pati nten hebben minder geld kunnen vaak niet werken hebben slechtere huisvesting en wonen in een wijk waar het ieder voor zich is vaak hebben ze alleen de hulpverlening het is in en in triest het gaat allemaal om geld ook in de zorg een baan zoeken valt al niet mee en als je dan ook nog een psychiatrisch verleden op je cv hebt
5880306 een heleboel beschermde banen zijn wegbezuinigd bij de sociale werkvoorziening kan je eigenlijk niet meer werken als je echt gehandicapt bent die moeten ook concureren terwijl werk toch een stukje erkenning geeft
5880307 de ergste gevallen zullen zo kort mogelijk behandeld worden en daarna met een kluitje in het riet gestuurd worden we worden steeds meer een ehbo post wilt u genezen dan gaat u betalen

5880332 i refuse to accept other peoples ideas of happiness for me
5880333 at this point the decision is to not run a cope mayoral candidate if we can reach an agreement with vision
5880334 but if we cant reach an agreement we would run a cope mayoral candidate
5880335 i have meditated and considered my decision to put aside the shugden at length in my soul and spirit before coming to the right decision
5880336 we are in the right hes the one who is being incoherent on one hand hes always preaching freedom of religion and compassion but on the other hes forbidding us to worship the god we choose
5880337 were not violating buddhas teachings and were excluded from everywhere just because of our religion
5880338 arent you ashamed of betraying the dalai lama youre a monk he is our only pillar the only person we can count on
5880339 i was the only shugden in my village every day i grew more afraid of attacks i had to block my door with stones for people not to break into my house
5880340 their cults all over the world are financed by the chinese
5880341 people are afraid of shugden violence they are like terrorists they will stop at nothing everyone knows this
5880342 i approve the chinese presence in tibet what we are living with the dalai lama today shows how authoritarian his theocratic regime must have been in the past it was much more violent than what tibetans are living today under chinese rule
5880343 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5880344 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5880345 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films

5880348 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish
5880349 we didnt have anything to do with our birth we are all here because some woman somewhere gave us life her pain her effort for our life and when a mother gives like that to a child she is showing us what god is like but sometimes this part of gods nature is overlooked a lot of us are comfortable with male imagery for god but what about female imagery for god is god limited to a gender or does god transcend and yet include what we know as male and female maybe if we were more aware of the feminine imagery for god we would have a better understanding of who god is and what god is like
5880350 what would it look like if you applied monastic values to the lives of ordinary high school students

5880355 well i really would like to keep my head actually
5880356 oh but you will get a free ticket to the london bridge experience and the london tombs and of course you can keep your head just grab it under your arm

5880361 you just said foreach doesnt create garbage in fact you said that was nonsense
5880362 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5880363 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5880364 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5880365 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the
5880366 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5880367 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5880368 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5880369 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5880370 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5880371 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5880375 la cr tica pr ctica del comunismo es cosa hecha
5880376 para una mente formada en la tradici n del marxismo radical esta petici n sonaba como una llamada a reemprender nuestro trabajo de los a os cincuenta y sesenta llevar al frente el an lisis cr tico del capitalismo tard o y de la pretendida sociedad comunista proyecto ciertamente conmovedor pero perfectamente in til
5880377 recordando estas grandes l neas de la cr tica marxista por todos conocidas experimentamos un sentimiento arcaico y embarazoso influye la manera en que la evoco pero el verdadero motivo es que el espectro se ha desvanecido llev ndose consigo el ltimo gran relato cr tico lejos de la escena hist rica
5880378 para el marxismo el sentido de la historia nicamente puede leerse a trav s de las etapas de la lucha de clases estas etapas est n dial cticamente vinculadas con la conciencia de s que cobran las clases en el proceso hist rico total la clase es definida en ltimo an lisis por la situaci n en las relaciones objetivas de producci n infraestructura pero las fluctuaciones de su volumen y de su combatividad que reflejan las modificaciones incesantes de esta infraestructura est n tambi n dial cticamente ligadas con factores supraestructurales pol ticos religiosos jur dicos ideol gicos propiamente dichos para que la dial ctica de la lucha de clases motor de la historia sea posible es necesario que las superestructuras entren en contradicci n con la infraestructura o producci n de la vida material
5880379 la escatolog a narra la experiencia de un sujeto afectado por una falta y profetiza que esta experiencia acabar en los confines de los tiempos con la remisi n del mal la destrucci n de la muerte y la vuelta al hogar del padre es decir con pleno significado
5880380 el relato de las luces la dial ctica rom ntica o especulativa y el relato marxista despliegan la misma historicidad que el cristianismo porque conservan el principio escatol gico
5880381 ley de dios en el para so cristiano ley de la naturaleza en el derecho natural divagado por rousseau sociedad sin clases antes que la familia la propiedad y el estado imaginado por engels
5880382 el tema principal de este viejo orden mundial ser la confrontaci n a escala planetaria entre conquistadores y pueblos conquistados esta confrontaci n ha tenido formas diversas y ha recibido diferentes nombres imperialismo neo colonialismo conflicto norte sur centro contra periferia g 7 grupo de los 7 pa ses m s industrializados y sus sat lites contra el resto del mundo o simplemente aun la conquista del mundo por europa
5880383 los pasos prometidos por las grandes s ntesis doctrinales terminan en sangrientos callejones sin salida de ah la pesadumbre de los espectadores en el final de este siglo xx
5880384 todo lo que es real es racional todo lo que es racional es real
5880385 todo lo que es proletario es comunista todo lo que es comunista es proletario pero berl n de 1953 budapest de 1956 checoslovaquia de 1968 polonia de 1980 y no digo m s refutan la doctrina del materialismo hist rico los trabajadores se levantan contra el partido
5880386 de este modo la tesis de hegel se torna por la propia dial ctica hegeliana en su reverso todo lo que es real dentro de los dominios de la historia humana se convierte con el tiempo en irracional lo es ya de consiguiente por su destino lleva en si de antemano el germen de lo irracional y todo lo que es racional en la cabeza del hombre se halla destinado a ser un d a real por mucho que hoy choque todav a con la aparente realidad existente la tesis de que todo lo real es racional se resuelve siguiendo todas las reglas del m todo discursivo hegeliano en esta otra todo lo que existe merece perecer
5880387 en que daba al traste para siempre con el car cter definitivo de todos los resultados del pensamiento y la acci n del hombre
5880388 durante la pr ctica totalidad de la era moderna el valor de las personas se ha medido por el rendimiento que produce su trabajo ahora que progresivamente el valor del producto hecho por el hombre tiende a ser m s insignificante e irrelevante en un mundo cada vez m s automatizado se deber n explorar nuevas formas de definir el valor de la persona y las relaciones humanas
5880389 la ruptura de la sociedad en clases sociales es tambi n la ruptura de la pr ctica es decir de la transformaci n silenciosa de las relaciones sociales con la teor a
5880390 no puede tener acceso espont neo al lenguaje y a la articulaci n a la teor a y a la organizaci n
5880391 no por traiciones como dicen los maniqueos sino desde el interior por la ca da en lo ya pensado por la degeneraci n en lo establecido
5880392 este capitalismo no ser a dif cil encontrarlo en cuanto reificaci n como dec a luk cs en pleno centro del marxismo oficial
5880393 podemos distinguir los hombres de los animales por la conciencia por la religi n o por lo que se quiera pero los hombres mismos comienzan a ver la diferencia entre ellos y los animales tan pronto comienzan a producir sus medios de vida paso este que se halla condicionado por su organizaci n corp rea al producir sus medios de vida el hombre produce indirectamente su propia vida material
5880394 este modo de producci n no debe considerarse solamente en el sentido de la reproducci n de la existencia f sica de los individuos es ya m s bien un determinado modo de la actividad de estos individuos un determinado modo de manifestar su vida un determinado modo de vida de los mismos los individuos son tal y como manifiestan su vida lo que son coincide por consiguiente con su producci n tanto con lo que producen como con el modo de c mo producen lo que los individuos son depende por tanto de las condiciones materiales de su producci n
5880395 no hay una mente que refleje sin m s la realidad el conocimiento humano refleja las condiciones sociales del proceso de producci n
5880396 despu s de marx no se puede aclarar el conocimiento sin explicar la sociedad
5880397 el nico obst culo insuperable con el que choca la hegemon a del g nero econ mico es la heterogeneidad de los reg menes de frases y la de los g neros de discurso es el hecho de que no existe el lenguaje y no existe el ser sino que s lo hay sucesos que ocurren

5880400 como acontecimiento dado en la naturaleza hist rica de la humanidad la revoluci n francesa pertenece a ese residuo de datos a ese resto de singularidades y de existencias que est a la espera de enunciaciones una vez que la proposici n cognitiva se hizo cargo en la forma de presentaci n de ejemplos de lo que le corresponde en las intuiciones que ella pueda subsumir bajo regularidades ese resto espera la proposici n teleol gica y sin embargo su falta de forma parece destinarlo al fracaso absoluto
5880401 lo hist rico pol tico s lo se presenta a la aserci n por casos y estos operan no como ejemplos y menos aun como esquemas
5880402 en cuanto a la filosof a de la historia de la cual ni siquiera podr hablarse en un pensamiento cr tico es una ilusi n nacida de la apariencia de que los signos son ejemplos o esquemas
5880403 la demencia del entusiasmo en el caso de la revoluci n francesa y en favor del partido revolucionario atestigua la extrema tensi n que experimenta la humanidad espectadora entre la nulidad de lo que le es presentado y las ideas de la raz n aqu la idea de rep blica a la que va unida la idea de autonom a del pueblo y la idea de paz entre los estados
5880404 el entusiasmo hist rico pol tico est pues al borde de la demencia es un acceso patol gico y como tal no tiene validez tica puesto que la tica exige la liberaci n de todo pathos motivador la tica s lo permite ese pathos ap tico que acompa a a la obligaci n y que es el respeto

5880410 la situaci n del mundo post pol tico est repleta de trampas y de peligros el terreno pantanoso de democracia incierta ambigua y casi inexistente en muchos pa ses de am rica latina hace aquellas trampas todav a m s insidiosas pero como se ve tambi n el terreno de europa se hace dif cil quiz sin embargo naci un tiempo en que la calidad t cnica del conocimiento adquiere un valor esencial
5880411 lo concreto es la totalidad que comprende a los entes los objetos las cosas por ejemplo el capitalismo o el mercado mundial como totalidad lo abstracto son los mismos entes los objetos las cosas que son parte de los todos enunciados pero que son analizados como todos en la realidad la mesa es parte del aula universitaria la mesa del profesor pero como mesa en cuanto tal es abstracta es abstra da de la totalidad en la que es parte y es considerada por la inteligencia representativa en su esencia wesen la mesa en cuanto tal es abstracta el aula que determina la forma de la mesa del profesor y es el aula como totalidad pedag gica la que diferencia dicha mesa del carpintero del carnicero de operaciones etc es lo concreto

5880675 people who were approved for a grant scheme have been informed in recent days they cannot go ahead with their proposed work
5880676 there is no funding shortfall the 71 4 million we gave this year exceeds last years allocation by almost 100 000
5880677 will be dealt with in the light of any savings emerging later in the year in other local authority areas
5880678 cash starved local authorities can only get more cash to pay for these schemes if other local authorities do not spend all of their allocation with massive waiting lists this is highly unlikely
5880679 have not been affected by the cutbacks and will get their promised grants

5880690 i want gary glitter to be controlled while hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5880691 and i think its very important that theyre confident without being cocky and that theyre not too self centred because youre really an ambassador for the year and there are people pulling a bit out of you everywhere
5880692 you need to be intelligent and have plenty of common sense but most important you need to have that little bit of x factor that if you walk into a room and people are expecting the rose of tralee that something just happens
5880693 although the dome is the same the stage is the same the 31 stories are different every year
5880694 there are great stories probably the best ive heard in four years there are tragic stories and there are stories of girls whove overcome unbelievable disabilities

5880704 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5880705 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5880706 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5880707 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5880708 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns

5880747 when i met my current beau id actually pretty much given up on meeting anyone of substance at least i was taking a break after meeting a number of nice guys that i knew would never amount to a relationship so i hid my profile and started haunting the forums on pof answering questions on everything from dating to fitness i noticed my current beau who was a regular poster there a beautiful writer who contributed to poetry forums and had long exchanges on many other topics from politics to relationships
5880748 i was email friends with tim whom i met in the chat room for at least a year and a half he was one of a group that i planned to meet when i visited washington state i do want to stress that the friendship was totally platonic and had never gone beyond that stage i was not looking for someone and neither was he
5880749 there were probably a dozen normal guys for every one weirdo i think the important thing to keep in mind is that the men who use dating services are pretty much doing it for the same reason that women are to find someone they connect with

5880806 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5880819 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan senator mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks and that as despicable as saddam hussein was posed no imminent threat to the american people
5880820 in the run up to the invasion of iraq i warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the middle east create new centers of terrorism and tie us down in a costly and open ended occupation senator mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows emphasis mine senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5880821 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5880822 for years i have called for more resources and more troops to finish the fight in afghanistan
5880823 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country

5880834 he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god so do you really believe in him or ever thought or did someone teach you there is no real jesus christ 19 and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil 20 for everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed and did you say to yourself not me i am not evil i dont believe in evilness and i hate god and who he is 21 but he who does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be clearly seen that they have been done in god

5880851 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5880852 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5880853 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
5880854 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
5880855 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
5880856 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
5880857 cadres should feel free to uphold democracy in whatever manner they choose using whichever projectiles and flammables come to hand
5880858 cadres must understand that the 2010 world cup is going to make the party and a number of senior comrades extremely rich and when senior comrades are rich democracy is rich
5880859 we therefore call upon them to behave in a way that goes against their more incendiary democratic urges and to refrain from performing acts of love for msholozi that involve threats to kill eliminate remove or otherwise terminally inconvenience political opponents

5880865 in a nutshell we were looking at about fifteen zulu dancers doing the whole furry ankle bracelet stomping thing and then pj powers singing a ballad called my african soul swells like a soccer ball being pumped up and then about a hundred little kids releasing balloons filled with helium and then a kid in a wheelchair releasing a white dove

5880873 today carousel mall hosted its latest public suicide there have ben several people who have jumped to their death from the upper levels at the mall in syracuse ny i have been fortunate enough to have not witnessed any of these events firsthand though today was almost the first after a day of preparing for classes that begin next week at syracuse university i was on my way home with the area construction i found myself on a detour near the mall so i stopped into the post office in the mall at about 6 15 or 6 30 pm down the corridor and one level below me was the end of a journey that began 21 years ago and 6 stories above that journey ended minutes before i walked into the mall what disturbs me more than the public suicide is the limited media coverage this event is receiving most coverage is in the form of user comments on the story at syracuse com though the credibility of these sources is weak at best i know there is evidence that reporting of suicide through media outlets leads to increased suicide rates and for that reason these stories fail to make it past the gatekeeper at the newspaper tv station i feel that todays tragedy offers cnn the opportunity to shed some light on public suicide and suicide prevention carousel mall is not the only mall to witness these events as the mall of america has had several as well this is an issue readers worldwide need to be exposed to it is also an opportunity to showcase the organizations like to write love on her arms www twloha com that use music and musicians to put people in need in contact with trained professionals i urge you to follow this story thank you for reading and thank you for caring

5881057 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5881058 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5881059 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5881060 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
5881061 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
5881062 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
5881063 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
5881064 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
5881065 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
5881066 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
5881067 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
5881068 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
5881069 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
5881070 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
5881071 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
5881072 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
5881073 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
5881074 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
5881075 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
5881076 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa

5881079 enter a judgment on the validity of a gestational agreement and that where there is a valid gestational agreement the court may then order the department of health to issue a replacement birth certificate with the names of the intended parents on it
5881080 in this era of evolving reproductive technology and intent based parenthood our laws must acknowledge these realities and not simply cling to genetic connections as preconditions to being placed on a birth certificate

5881083 the law provides that people can adopt babies or children if they wish but there are processes adoption does not cost money but in the cases of these maternity homes the babies are paid for which is what we want to stop we are going to all the states to establish monitoring groups to check these homes because we cannot do it alone we need information we can work on and through the monitoring group we can go after these homes and prosecute any of them involved in sale of babies
5881084 lehman may mark down some of its 61 billion of mortgage and other asset backed securities after benchmark residential and commercial mortgage related indexes declined by as much as 20 percent the analysts wrote the company may have already been selling some commercial mortgage assets they added
5881085 lehman leh has just begun to defile itself after several quarters of losses and promises of better days the press is reporting that the brokerage will have negative earnings for the most recent period that will total at least 1 8 billion big earnings deficits are almost always followed by a need to raise money
5881086 lehman appears to have two options one is to sell off a valuable asset that might be a part of its real estate portfolio or its money management arm neuberger berman the other way out for lehman is to raise more capital via a sale of shares or debt that amount would probably have to be in excess of 4 billion if the company wants to create a cushion against future losses
5881087 either path undermines the value of lehmans common shares and that value could easily go to zero by the end of the year the companys current market cap is only 11 billion so far this year lehmans stock prices is down almost 75

5881137 ho letto che la petizione lanciata dal partito democratico ha raggiunto un milione di firme e una petizione che in apparenza dice tutto ma che in pratica non serve a niente perche resteranno firme inutili sulla carta che berlusconi non si degnera nemmeno di prendere in considerazione
5881138 non capisco spiega di pietro come possa vantarsi del milione di firme quando ne erano sufficienti 500 mila per mettere berlusconi con le spalle al muro e abrogare la legge salva premier il governo sottolinea di pietro sarebbe stato in discussione sul piano morale su quello del conflitto dinteressi e sarebbe stata evidente a tutti lanomalia di un signore che fa le leggi per non farsi processare mi spiace constatare e la conclusione dellex magistrato che ci sono due opposizioni una fatta solo di parole e una vera che cerca di agire con i fatti

5881142 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
5881143 we couldnt be more thrilled mostly for the race fans
5881144 to be in nascars form of the playoffs with the chase is something thats very special
5881145 and the unbelievers are allies protectors of each other unless you do this protect each other there would be tumult and oppression on earth and great mischief
5881146 the dream came to silence at the pilgrimage because the negligence of the pilgrimage and the wisdom in it has attracted not the calamity but the divine wrath and compulsion qahr and its penalty did not help the expiation of sins but rather made our sins excessive
5881147 the greatest obligatory duty in this time is to work for the islamic unity the aim and objective of the unity are to vibrate such a long luminous blessed chain that connects the islamic centers and mosques masjids and milieus which are branched out in subdivisions and thereby to awake those who are tied to that chain and to lead them towards the path of development with desire and command of conscience
5881148 we do not do any harm but also we do not have the power to do anything beneficial therefore we are excused
5881149 communism free masonry atheism and irreligion are directly resulting in anarchism against these terrible forces of destruction only and solely the islamic unity surrounding the truths of the quran can endure and it is the only way to save this land from the occupation of foreigners and this nation from falling into anarchy and the means to save the mankind from these dangers
5881150 my dear truthful brothers we congratulate your blessed bairam feast with all our souls inshaallah you live long enough to see the great feast of the world of islam too there are many signs and indications that the quran al hakeem which is the source of the holy constitution of the united republics of islam will rule completely in the future and will bring a true feast to the mankind
5881151 we congratulate the great feast of islam on account of that the islamic unity which is starting to develop in asia and africa for the moment and making 400 million muslims brothers to each other and assistant both materially and spiritually is under establishment within the newly formed islamic states and that the sacred laws of the quran al hakeem are becoming the constitutions of those new islamic states
5881152 yes the ill treatments and oppressions of those foreigners like wild beasts has accelerated the currents of freedom independence and the islamic unity in the world of islam consequently they have resulted in the formation of independent islamic states inshaallahu taala the united republics of islam will also come into existence and islam will rule in sovereignty all over the world we strongly hope and ask this from the divine mercy
5881153 the turkish nation which rejoiced the world of islam with its heroism for a thousand years and protected the unity of muslims and served as a great means to save the world of humanity from absolute infidelity and corruption and the brethren of those who are turkified should you not stand now as protector of the quran and the truths of belief heroically as in the old times and advocate the truths of the quran and belief directly instead of propagating the western civilization at the harm of the religion i am informing you patriots and i can prove with definitive evidence that the world of islam will show enmity and a dreadful hatred instead of love and brotherhood towards the turkish nation which is its heroic brother and the commander and this turkish nation will be defeated by anarchy and terror covered by atheism which is now trying to destroy the world of islam the citadel and the glorious army of the muslim world this turkish nation will be divided into pieces and will be invaded by the dreadful dragon coming out of the north east yes indeed this hero nation can only endure against the two external dreadful currents with the strength of the quran this nation which has been blended and united with the truth of islam and found all its honour in the past within the circle of islam can only stop the current communism which is coming forcefully by using the absolute infidelity atheism absolute despotism absolute dissoluteness and by offering the wealth of the honest people to the vagabond the patriots and the nationalists of this nation can stop that current inshaallah by accepting as the foundational rule and the guiding principle the truths of the quran which are like a great artery for that combined united nationhood the second current this one has become succesful to a degree up until now through a strategy which involves accusing the strong islamic centrality in this country with irreligion in order to warm itself to its colonies in the muslim world and thereby to bond them completely and disconnecting the spiritual ties of the world of islam and transforming their brotherhood with this nation turks into enmity if this current acts in reason it will have much benefits and might keep its great victories to a degree if it changes this dreadful strategy and flatters the religion of islam in this center just like it flattered the other parts of the muslim world and so this country and this people can escape from a terrible disaster besides a muslim cannot be compared to the people of the other nations religions if he gives up his religion he would become an anarchist he would not accept to live under any restriction or law he cannot be administered by any educational or supervisional methods but absolute despotism and total bribery
5881154 yes those who are attacking the risaale i noor behind the scene are those who are covertly establishing the atheism by making the politics an instrument for irreligion in order to destroy the favorable inclination and love and brotherhood of the muslim world which are the greatest power of the people in this country and to turn them into hatred they deceived the government and the justice twice and claimed that risaale i noor and its students may use the religion as an instrument for politics and they may act harmfully for the general security
5881155 o malicious ones although the risaale i noor is not concerned with the politics but since it destroys the absolute infidelity atheism it also destroys and rejects in principles the anarchism which is the foundations of the atheism and the absolute despotism which is the roof of the atheism
5881156 a regrettable social condition and an awesome disease affecting the life of society fit to be wept over by the heart of islam to forget and abandon internal enmities when foreign enemies appear and attack is a demand of social welfare recognized and enacted even by the most primitive peoples what then ails those who claim to be serving the islamic community that at a time when numberless enemies are taking up positions to attack one after the other they fail to forget their petty enmities and instead prepare the ground for the enemies attacks it is disgraceful savagery and treason committed against the social life of islam
5881157 since these strange moral bribes have been given in return for the policies of the foreigners and their insignificant temporary aids because of the weakness and lack of power due to lack of this alliance and there is a meaning in power as if the brotherhood of the four hundred million brothers and the path of the billions of our ancestors have not been considered seriously they give bribes in the form of high salaries to the state officials thinking that thereby they are obliged to obtain strength so that the security and their policies would not be harmed through so much wasteful expenditure without considering the poverty of the nation the present politicians in this country must certainly and definitely give a very big gift and a harmless bribe to the four hundred million brothers who are equivalent to the future united republics of the islamic world for the benefits of the country and the nation and this muslim state a bribe ten times as much as the political and moral bribe they gave to the west and the foreigners and that bribe which is acceptable necessary very beneficial lawful and obligatory is to take as the guiding principle and the code of laws of the following and hold fast all together to the bond of allah and be not divided among yourselves q 3 103 every soul is accountable for itself no bearer of a burden bears the burden of another q 6 164 do not engage in disputes with one another lest you lose courage and become insignificant and your power depart q 8 46 which are the foundations of the islamic mutual assistance and a divine rule and the bond and the holy constitution of the gift of the quran
5881158 i created you as peoples nations and tribes so that you should know one another and the relations between you in social life and assist one another not so that you should regard each other as strangers refusing to acknowledge one another and nurturing hostility and enmity
5881159 if language and religion are the same the nation is the same

5881161 we are not living in the old times in old times the ruler was a single person the mufti
5881162 the eye of contentment is too dim to perceive faults it is the eye of anger that exhibits all vice
5881163 difference among my people is an instance of the sickness of partisanship also delivers the oppressed common people from the oppressor elite for if the elite of a town or village join together they will destroy the oppressed common people if there is partisanship the oppressed may seek refuge with one of the parties and thus save himself it is also from the confrontation of opinions and the contradiction of views that truth becomes apparent in its full measure
5881164 love for the sake of allah dislike for the sake of allah judgement for the sake of allah
5881165 dislike for the sake of god judgement for the sake of god
5881166 the believers are together like a well founded building one part of which supports the other
5881167 the most noble prophet pbuh wants no reward for carrying out the duty of prophethood he wants only love for his family
5881168 according to this meaning it seems there is an advantage to be gained from a family relationship whereas according to the meaning of the most honoured of you in the sight of god is the most righteous of you q 49 13 it is not in regard to family relationships that prophethood functions but in regard to closeness to god
5881169 o god grant blessings to our master muhammed and to the family of our master muhammed as you granted blessings to abraham and to the family of abraham indeed you are worthy of praise most exalted
5881170 i leave you two things if you adhere to them you will find salvation one is gods book the other is my family
5881171 o god grant blessings to our master muhammed and to the family of our master muhammed as you granted blessings to abraham and to the family of abraham in all the world indeed you are worthy of all praise exalted

5881176 although in the name of god the merciful the compassionate is one verse it was revealed one hundred and fourteen times in the quran
5881177 you alone do we worship and from you alone do we seek help
5881178 man is in a form showing the divine name of all merciful in its entirety
5881179 man is in the form of the all merciful one

5881392 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5881393 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5881394 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look the i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5881395 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5881396 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5881397 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5881398 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5881399 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence

5881534 the republican party today was assessing the potential political fallout
5881535 revealed wednesday that he was repeatedly molested by an unnamed republican congressman in the late 1990s
5881536 authorities have not acted on haggards allegations saying that republicans are often accused of wrongdoings simply because so many of them lead secret gay or criminal lifestyles
5881537 republicans who have leaned enormously on the vote of conservative christians in recent years already reeling from a series of congressional scandals
5881538 top house republicans knew for months about e mail traffic between representative mark foley and a former teenage page but kept the matter secret and allowed mr foley to remain head of a congressional caucus on childrens issues
5881539 convinced the relationship had become romantic some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself
5881540 to his advisers even the appearance of a close bond with a lobbyist whose clients often had business before the senate committee mr mccain led threatened the story of redemption and rectitude that defined his political identity

5881546 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year the company said
5881547 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe chief executive louis gries said
5881548 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5881549 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share

5881554 and when youre scrubbing with gauze and oil to get a lot of dirt a lot of splinters burnt skin out its very very tender because if they left it it would have become a tattoo it would have been there permanently so they had to scrub these burns
5881555 a lot of those thoughts about pulling the pin and quitting came very close to the accident and i think that was because of the emotional state and the realisation of just how serious my accident was
5881556 there was something in me that i just wanted to get back on the bike and as soon as i threw my leg over the bike for the first time even though i could only pedal for one to two minutes i felt so uplifted after that first session on the bike and it just made me want to get back on it again and again
5881557 it has been seven months of emotional high and its been so draining

5881563 were very proud of her we didnt even think she make the team after all the injuries she had
5881564 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5881565 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5881566 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5881567 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5881568 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5881569 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5881570 we must caution that our operating environment remains uncertain mr savage said
5881571 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009 asx ppt net profit dropped to 128 8 million for the year ended june 30 as the freeze in securitisation markets also hampered its corporate trust business shares of perpetual were down 16 cents or 0 4 per cent at 45 74 by late morning in a firmer market overall the benchmark s amp p asx 200 index was 0 7 per cent higher our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008 mr deverall said as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5881572 this result was due primarily to reduce values in equity and debt markets and also outflows from perpetuals credit and fixed interest and australian equities institutional businesses

5881807 borges pronunci una conferencia en c rdoba sobre literatura contempor nea en la am rica latina habl de m como un gran escritor y agreg desgraciadamente nunca podr tener una relaci n amistosa con l porque es comunista cuando le la noticia en los diarios me alegr m s que nunca del homenaje que le rend en la vuelta al d a porque yo aunque l est m s que ciego ante la realidad del mundo seguir teniendo a distancia esa relaci n amistosa que consuela de tantas tristezas me temo que esa posici n no sea entendida por los que cada vez pretenden m s que el escritor sea como un ladrillo con todas las aristas a la vista el paralelep pedo macizo que s lo puede ajustarse a otro paralelep pedo no sirvo para hacer paredes me gustan m s echadas abajo

5881809 el humor de bioy por ejemplo me gusta mucho porque al igual que el humor de borges es de directa ra z anglosajona bioy y borges rechazando como rechac yo eso que los espa oles llaman humor y que no es nada m s que el chiste macabro y en general de muy mala calidad han sabido meterlo en la estructura mental y ling stica del espa ol y darle una especie de derecho de ciudad que le quita digamos el fondo anglosaj n y lo vuelve perfectamente argentino y latinoamericano en ese sentido yo encuentro una gran afinidad de mi propio humor con el de bioy y con el de borges
5881810 en la actualidad cada vez que se menciona a borges inmediatamente la gente se divide en bandos perfectamente diferenciados en am rica latina dir a yo en otros lugares se lo conoce como escritor y lo que pasa en am rica latina es que en estos ltimos a os adem s de su trabajo como escritor hemos conocido los puntos de vista geopol ticos de borges esto ha creado con respecto a l un antagonismo manifiesto de parte de mucha gente que no puede aceptar cierto tipo de declaraciones hechas por alguien cuya palabra tiene tanta repercusi n en el interior y en el extranjero yo personalmente no puedo aceptar que diga por ejemplo que el nico defecto de estados unidos es haberle dado educaci n a los negros sin embargo jorge luis borges ha escrito algunos de los mejores cuentos de la historia universal de la literatura el escribi tambi n una historia universal de la infamia
5881811 la gran lecci n de borges no fue una lecci n tem tica ni de contenidos ni de mec nicas fue una lecci n de escritura la actitud de un hombre que frente a cada frase ha pensado cuidadosamente no s qu adjetivo pon a sino qu adjetivo sacaba cayendo despu s en cierto exceso que era el de poner un nico adjetivo de tal manera que usted se caiga un poco de espaldas lo que a veces puede ser un defecto

5881863 and after that those who have been thus tithed shall pay one tenth of all their interest annually and this shall be a standing law unto them forever for my holy priesthood saith the lord
5881864 verily i say unto you it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties and shall observe this law or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you
5881865 wherefore abram paid unto him tithes of all that he had of all the riches which he possessed which god had given him more than that which he had need
5881866 for your guidance in this matter please be advised that we have uniformly replied that the simplest statement we know of is that statement of the lord himself that the members of the church should pay one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income no one is justified in making any other statement than this we feel that every member of the church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord and to make payment accordingly
5881867 the simplest statement we know of is the statement of the lord himself namely that the members of the church should pay one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income no one is justified in making any other statement than this
5881868 one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income
5881869 one tenth of all their surplus properties annually which is understood to mean surplus income
5881870 i remember dad coming home that night and dropping 20 silver dollars into my hands money was hard to come by and i thought i had all the money in the world i counted admired and polished each coin carefully when sunday came i reluctantly put two shiny coins into my pocket to pay my tithing
5881871 you have need of many things in this world food clothing and shelter for your family and yourself the common comforts of life and the things that shall be conducive to refinement to development to righteous enjoyment
5881872 the things that shall be conducive to refinement to development to righteous enjoyment
5881873 we feel that every member of the church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord and to make payment accordingly
5881874 reduced to the utmost penury so that she had nothing coming in
5881875 have you ever found a landlord on earth who was willing to make that kind of equitable contract with you
5881876 i feel in my heart that i could scarcely raise my countenance to heaven if i tried to defraud god out of that which is rightfully his
5881877 pay ten percent across the board regardless of your income
5881878 that which god had given him more than that which he had need
5881879 of all thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
5881880 a man who has not paid his tithing is unfit to be baptized for his dead if a man has not faith enough to attend to these little things he has not faith enough to save himself and his friends
5881881 and this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people
5881882 those who have thus been tithed shall pay one tenth of all their interest annually and this shall be a standing law unto them forever
5881883 all their surplus property and after that those who have thus been tithed
5881884 verily i say unto you it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties
5881885 we feel that every member of the church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord and to make payment accordingly
5881886 in more recent times the church has not called upon the members to give all their surplus property to the church but it has been the requirement according to the covenant that they pay the tenth
5881887 the celestial law requires one tenth part of all a mans substance which he possesses at the time he comes into the church see d amp c 119 1 and one tenth part of his annual increase ever after see d amp c 119 4 if it requires all man can earn to support himself and his family he is not tithed at all the celestial law does not take the mothers and childrens bread neither ought else which they really need for their comfort the poor that have not of this worlds good to spare but serve and honor god according to the best of their abilities in every other way shall have a celestial crown in the eternal kingdom of our father
5881888 we call it a free will offering and so it is for everything in the gospel is by free will but nevertheless it is a law of god which to us is everlasting as cited above pp 120 121
5881889 why pay a full 10 percent of ones annual income if that is more than what is scripturally and officially required
5881890 pay your tithing on the basis on which you wish to be blessed
5881891 i think you are a very generous man with someone elses property
5881892 you have told me what you have done with the lords money but you have not told me that you have given anyone a penny of your own he is the best partner you have in the world he gives you everything you have even the air you breathe he has said you should take one tenth of what comes to you and give it to the church as directed by the lord you havent done that you have taken your best partners money and have given it away
5881893 when you are in the service of your fellow beings you are only in the service of your god
5881894 forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us
5881895 many years ago john orth worked in a foundry in australia and in a terrible accident hot molten lead splashed onto his face and body
5881896 one year he did not pay any tithing and went to talk to the branch president the branch president understood the situation but asked john to make it a matter of prayer and fasting so that he could find a way to pay his tithing john and his wife alice fasted and prayed and determined that the only thing of value they owned was her engagement ring a beautiful ring bought in happier times after much anguish they decided to take the ring to a pawnbroker and learned it was worth enough to pay their tithing and some other outstanding bills
5881897 forced to go door to door seeking odd jobs and handouts
5881898 among those who do not sacrifice there are two extremes one is the rich gluttonous man who wont and the other is the poor destitute man who believes he cant but how can you ask someone who is starving to eat less is there a level of poverty so low that sacrifice should not be expected or a family so destitute that paying tithing should cease to be required
5881899 lord often teaches using extreme circumstances to illustrate a principle
5881900 n o bishop no missionary should ever hesitate or lack the faith to teach the law of tithing to the poor
5881901 and this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people
5881902 please note that the tithe is not just any freewill offering nor is it a 20th or some other fraction of our annual interest or income
5881903 president howard w hunter stated it this way the law is simply stated as one tenth of all their interest interest means profit compensation increase it is the wage of one employed the profit from the operation of a business the increase of one who grows or produces or the income to a person from any other source the lord said it is a standing law forever as it has been in the past in conference report apr 1964 35
5881904 be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord

5881971 ceea ce ne provoaca cea mai mare indignare este sa vedem televiziunile straine preluind imaginile noastre si interpretindu le in sens opus precum cele cu thinvali bombardat de georgieni difuzate cu textul
5881972 sau ruinele thinvali filmate de corespondentii nostri si difuzate pe cnn pentru a ilustra bombardamentele ruse la gori
5881973 abia dupa doua sau trei zile de la inceperea conflictului un analist american a recunoscut la cnn ca tbilisi a inceput razboiul
5881974 dreptatea era de partea rusilor cel putin la inceputul conflictului de aceea acoperirea mediatica rusa a fost convingatoare cel putin in interiorul tarii
5881975 din punctul meu de vedere saasakvili care a tras cu rachete asupra propriei populatiei este adevaratul vinovat chiar daca replica rusa nu a fost intotdeauna ireprosabila

5881978 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5881979 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5881980 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5881981 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5881982 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5881983 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5881984 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5881985 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5881986 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5881987 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5881988 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5881989 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views

5881991 a key non financial measure we focus on is volume points on a royalty basis or volume points which is essentially our weighted unit measure of product sales volume it is a useful measure for us as it excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and ignores the differences generated by varying retail pricing across geographic markets in general an increase in volume points in a particular geographic region or country indicates an increase in local currency net sales

5882027 i was just about to take the garbage out and it busted on me
5882028 can you call me back in 10 minutes so i can clean this up
5882029 it was my goal to be famous but i never found a way to be lyrical and commercial at the same time
5882030 trust me i want to be on channel 4 too
5882031 to be honest i just rhyme the only way i know how
5882032 it doesnt sound so different from whats on the radio to me but what do i know
5882033 one day a few years later i was taking a nap on my couch
5882034 when i woke up eminem was on television and they were talking about how he just made 200 million thats when he became my new enemy
5882035 i know i might not be that popular right now
5882036 but i went into the liquor store the other day and somebody recognized me so i guess thats a good start
5882037 he is so inconsiderate he doesnt even care about me or my feelings yeah just like yesterday when he said he is such a jerk and on and on
5882038 causes you to fear any mistake or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a complete looser and you will feel inadequate and worthless
5882039 im starting to drive the ball better and my putting is coming around so im looking forward to a good stretch here in the playoffs
5882040 my game is pretty much the same just the scoring at times isnt as good but every tournament were playing in if you shoot par youve played a heck of a round its been a tough stretch of tough golf
5882041 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5882042 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5882043 i want him to make me a better quarterback a better player and a better team leader
5882044 thats one of the greatest things you can do as a young player and earn your respect
5882045 i want to tell him i cant wait to come and learn from him
5882046 that was one of the pluses we had going for us is that we had a senior quarterback coming back that terrelle thought he could learn from
5882047 if there are some things that terrelle demonstrates that hes going to add to the package that maybe are not todds strong suits then maybe you find that mixture of everyones strengths
5882048 i think thats why a lot of people will put a huge emphasis on the usc game to try to give ohio state credibility

5882055 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5882056 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5882057 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5882058 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5882059 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5882060 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5882061 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
5882062 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5882063 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5882064 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5882065 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5882066 honestly i feel like any one of those three could win the gold medal
5882067 thats how good they are and thats how much depth we have
5882068 but you cant count kyle out because hes three time world champion so from a mental standpoint hes very strong and then you have mike day whos consistently the fastest guy out there
5882069 if those three can get into the final i like our chances
5882070 its going to be action packed from start to finish
5882071 were going to be reaching speeds of up to 40 mph jumping big jumps 30 feet long and of course there are going to be crashes
5882072 a couple older guys gave it to me saying i was smooth like butter on my bike i think its a good nickname its stuck with me
5882073 from a visual perspective he just looks like hes effortless when he rides
5882074 to me 90 of the race is won from the start in the blink of an eye you mess up you get a bad start you get cut off out the gate its not necessarily over but your chances are slim to catch back up
5882075 every time i get up on that starting hill im scared its a risk youre going to take if you love your sport as much as i do youre willing to take that
5882076 if we can shave a half second off his time at the start hes going to be really hard to beat
5882077 there are a lot of guys that ride the track really good or ride certain spots of the track good but kyle can do everything
5882078 everyone has one niche but hes got all the niches
5882079 neighbors would be standing out there thinking whats this guy doing a grown man out there riding his bicycle
5882080 but after i won the world championships it came out in the paper the neighbors came out and said thats awesome youre going to be in the olympics im getting some respect from them now im not just some punk kid out there riding my bike
5882081 were doing a lot of squatting a lot of powerlifting style movements
5882082 hes so laid back goes with the flow doesnt stress too much on anything
5882083 one time my wife told me she was leaving me so i packed my bag
5882084 i want to build a bmx training facility and work with kids

5882098 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5882099 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5882100 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5882101 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5882102 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5882103 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
5882104 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5882105 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
5882106 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
5882107 my agents spoke with other teams but as far as signing there was none of them
5882108 to have that taken away from you that can be really hard
5882109 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5882110 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
5882111 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling
5882112 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5882113 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5882114 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5882115 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5882116 i dont think he became the most talented of the but no one outworked him
5882117 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting

5882225 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5882226 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5882227 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5882228 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5882229 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5882230 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
5882231 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
5882232 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
5882233 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
5882234 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
5882235 we were all shouting at the driver to back up to try and rescue some of the people which he did
5882236 we got back and some of the guys jumped into the water and pulled some of the people onto our boat
5882237 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic
5882238 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5882239 somebody closed the coach doors and the man produced a machine gun from his shoulder bag and started firing
5882240 his gun was lying next to him it seemed he had been killed by a hand grenade or bomb he was carrying
5882241 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5882242 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views

5882246 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family
5882247 when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5882248 i was worried shed start doing drugs and drinking alcohol
5882249 knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5882250 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family
5882251 when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5882252 i was worried shed start doing drugs and drinking alcohol
5882253 knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5882254 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5882255 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5882256 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5882257 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5882258 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5882259 i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
5882260 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5882261 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps

5882266 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5882267 there is no doubt that this is politically motivated the sea shepherd conservation society is not protesting whaling we are opposing illegal whaling in accordance with the principles of the united nations world charter for nature if our activities are illegal then the warrant would be addressed to me not to three non officer volunteers
5882268 if the japanese police succeed in arresting any of these three men we will use the courts as a forum to focus international attention on japans continued illegal whaling activities
5882269 the arrest warrants against these three men will have absolutely no impact on the campaign we will return to the southern ocean whale sanctuary and we will resume our campaign of intervention against the illegal activities of the japanese whaling fleet
5882270 we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenseless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
5882271 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
5882272 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
5882273 her defaming of our national anthem in 1990 gave us insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing
5882274 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5882275 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5882276 my allegiance to senator mccain becomes stronger with any assault that tries to deter my loyalty to him

5882281 this movie isnt for critics so we didnt think it was necessary to screen it for them
5882282 but if im the cw a network struggling to justify its existence and the show thats going to make or break my future is premiering the day after labor day weeks before most people are going to be in the habit of checking out new shows youd think getting every bit of potential publicity would be the way to go no
5882283 no ones freedom to express an opinion has been squelched we all know where we stand if the cw doesnt want to send out advance copies it still cant stifle opinion and if anything its inviting you to make immediate comments even more critical of or positive about the show than i might be
5882284 in a weird way theres an advantage to the lack of pilot screeners since it makes it much more clear than usual that a tv

5882307 12 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves 13 and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves 14 and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them
5882308 13 and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem 14 and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting 15 and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables 16 and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise 17 and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
5882309 6 and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father
5882310 13 and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
5882311 19 have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee 20 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place 21 hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive
5882312 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
5882313 2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
5882314 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god 2 set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
5882315 13 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body 14 and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power 15 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid 16 what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh 18 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body
5882316 14 and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection
5882317 11 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men 12 teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world 13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ 14 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works
5882318 21 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him
5882319 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
5882320 22 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
5882321 27 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
5882322 22 repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
5882323 4 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me 5 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing
5882324 13 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
5882325 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might
5882326 11 strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
5882327 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength 30 even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall 31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
5882328 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
5882329 14 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
5882330 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls
5882331 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth 9 lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds 10 and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him 11 where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all 12 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering 13 forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye 14 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness
5882332 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service 2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
5882333 43 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none 44 then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished 45 then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
5882334 16 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people 17 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you 18 and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty
5882335 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god

5882340 there are no niggas and bitches here you are children of god were forgetting why were here in the first place i felt it was time to reinstill the strength thats inside of us and inside of our children
5882341 my approach to choosing is if i can see whats happening over the beat when it drops
5882342 then the writing process is just that i have stories that i already want to tell angel dust is a story about my homegirl kingdom of heaven just makes me think of peace to me its what heaven on earth sounds like so i wrote to that

5882357 leeds community school got just short of a quarter of a million pounds from leeds city council and other sources
5882358 we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago
5882359 we trap them then they will get birth control and then were going to have them microchipped so that we will know if we pick them up we are going to keep a running tab on them
5882360 there are people all over the place that watch the range and you cant set a trap up to collect horses and haul them out without someone seeing something
5882361 horses can still eat grass that is pretty low grade if they have water
5882362 they ingest a lot and then they tank up with water and the grass absorbs the water they get kind of like camels so long as they can get water
5882363 we try to work with the people to encourage better care
5882364 the goal here is to get the animals better cared for
5882365 i dont know why these young girls are getting involved
5882366 i wish i could get the horses from there and bring them to our home
5882367 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
5882368 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
5882369 the judiciary committee fails to address the fact that by appearing at a congressional hearing upon judicial order ms miers would risk forfeiting immunity and thus the ability to seek meaningful relief on appeal
5882370 the same is true regarding defendants obligations with respect to documents

5882372 ash amiga mmm no hombres fieles never never ni en este mundo ni en otro me combina la blusa
5882373 now shes flying over jumps and is the first horse kids want at shows shes a diamond in the rough
5882374 this is my passion this is a place for opportunity that you just dont find anywhere else
5882375 there are few places willing to take inexperienced young people and let them ride
5882376 horses allow children to think about something other than themselves you have to be aware for example when leading a horse
5882377 they dont feel the importance of giving young children the chance its about giving children the opportunity they wouldnt have had otherwise
5882378 they learn from the ground up to be able to ride you have to know how to care for horses stalls bathing all it takes
5882379 i havent seen other barns the way they run it here each rider isnt treated the same the trainers do what fits each riders needs
5882380 my friends are here my favorite part about horses is that they connect with you they are a non human best friend
5882381 we are not sure whether it is a suicide blast
5882382 mark seliger and i have been collaborating on various projects for years he photographed me for his first rolling stone cover
5882383 now years later we have reunited with him shooting my first campaign for sears marks photography is able to convey the heritage of the ll cool j brand and expertly captures the collection
5882384 the opportunity for synergy between sears and ll cool j has been phenomenal
5882385 it stems in large part from the authenticity of the campaign sears was a fixture in his life from the time he was a child he is committed to bringing that same relevance to families today the fact that ll cool j appeared on mark seligers first rolling stone cover and that mark is the mastermind behind this seasons visuals adds another dimension of genuineness these are real beginnings in an icons career that has spanned more than two decades they underscore the aspirational nature of the brand while maintaining ll cool js approachability to our customers
5882386 they came in and broke down my doors as if i was making weapons of mass destruction the only thing im making here is music and hits

5882403 20 then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him 21 and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom 22 but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are able 23 and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father 24 and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren 25 but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them 26 but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister 27 and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant 28 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
5882404 23 and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father

5882409 1 in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first 2 and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i was at shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw in a vision and i was by the river of ulai 3 then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last 4 i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great 5 and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes 6 and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power 7 and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand 8 therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven 9 and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land 10 and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them 11 yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of the sanctuary was cast down 12 and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prospered 13 then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot 14 and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed 15 and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man 16 and i heard a mans voice between the banks of ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision 17 so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision 18 now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright 19 and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be 20 the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media and persia 21 and the rough goat is the king of grecia and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king 22 now that being broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power 23 and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up 24 and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people 25 and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand 26 and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many days 27 and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward i rose up and did the kings business and i was astonished at the vision but none understood it
5882410 1 in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans 2 in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem 3 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes 4 and i prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments 5 we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments 6 neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land 7 o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee 8 o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee 9 to the lord our god belong mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against him 10 neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets 11 yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of god because we have sinned against him 12 and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem 13 as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth 14 therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he doeth for we obeyed not his voice 15 and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly 16 o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us 17 now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lords sake 18 o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great mercies 19 o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name 20 and whiles i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god 21 yea whiles i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation 22 and he informed me and talked with me and said o daniel i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding 23 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 24 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times 26 and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate
5882411 11 and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense 12 and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him 13 but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john 14 and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth 15 for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb 16 and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord 18 and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years 19 and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings
5882412 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth 27 to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary 28 and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women 29 and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be 30 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god 31 and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus 32 he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david 33 and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god 36 and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren 38 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her
5882413 35 again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples 36 and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god 37 and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus 38 then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou 39 he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour 40 one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother 41 he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ 42 and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone

5882448 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5882449 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5882450 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5882451 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5882452 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5882453 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5882454 weve got to work with the business sector to try and get carbon capture and storage in place because 80 per cent of our electricity in australia at the moment is currently by coal fired power stations he said

5882490 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5882491 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5882492 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5882493 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5882494 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5882495 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5882496 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5882497 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems

5882499 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5882503 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5882504 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5882505 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5882506 to come to the conclusion that i am homophobic from these sentences is far from the truth
5882507 some of my friends and colleagues are gay and if i was truly homophobic then i have picked the wrong industry

5882522 i always felt in there that i could match his handspeed and punch with him this was a tough guy i got away from my game plan and got hit a couple times
5882523 i give him credit for staying up for as long as he did i was hitting him with some good shots if he wants a rematch with his title at stake i would fight him but those kinds of decisions are made by my manager i will fight whoever he says
5882524 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5882525 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5882526 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882527 i eventually decided to quit without creating a fuss in the supreme national interest
5882528 musharraf had lost his utility as a useful asset for the war on terror
5882529 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
5882530 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
5882531 the army will play the same role it played from 1996 to 1998
5882532 the american role has always been paramount in pakistans politics the late general zia ul haq was defiant of washingtons interests and he faced an accidental death in a mysterious plane accident in 1988 had musharraf tried to exercise his constitutional powers to dissolve the assemblies he would also have been obstructing american interests in the region and would have faced a zia like fate
5882533 now the americans will have to use the two remaining national assets for their interests the political parties and the army chief kiani washington abhors nawaz sharif so they will distance themselves from him and focus on asif zardari the widower of benazir bhutto and head of the ppp
5882534 zardari because of corruption cases that have been leveled against him can be easily manipulated and therefore he will act obediently on their advice
5882535 i suspect that kiani is already part of their game
5882536 yes he could be the one but asfandyar failed to uphold his promised role to control militancy in the tribal areas without resort to military operations
5882537 in my opinion nawab attaullah mengal a baloch politician should be the president of the country given the recent mistreatments done in balochistan province in the name of military operations
5882538 there was no reason to use such brute force in a tribal area like bajaur
5882539 the only reason for such military action was to destroy the talibans approaches to kunar where american forces are all out to get the taliban kunar province lies in the northeast and connects to kabul previously the taliban were focused only on southeastern provinces
5882540 this is the role washington wants the pakistani army to play the cost is paid by pakistanis and 250 000 people were displaced during the bajaur operation
5882541 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882542 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
5882543 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
5882544 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
5882545 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
5882546 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
5882547 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
5882548 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
5882549 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882550 in fact it is stronger than it has ever been so far
5882551 it might not register that its really land at this point
5882552 most of the damage has really been limited to the heavy rainfall
5882553 street flooding downed power lines downed trees that kind of event
5882554 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882555 to succeed here you really do have to believe it will happen and really see yourself being able to do it but the reality is theres a lot of great people out there trying to get the same thing and its not likely to happen
5882556 you dont talk about that ahead of time and because of that some athletes who are great at believing dont really have a plan b and they dont have a gracious response to it because its something they havent prepared for
5882557 if i had competed in group a i would have won the gold my competitors were chasing my kilos
5882558 the interesting part is how we deal with these things its going to happen and how do you deal with it the ioc has put down clear rules regarding the medals i think that is a very strong message thats kind of reinforcing what we believe in acting on the best values of sports
5882559 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882560 the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5882561 negotiations here are you give me everything i want and i will walk away happy
5882562 it is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred
5882563 they are more rapid that is why they are much more active than the police
5882564 the asaish have lots of sources and thats why the americans depend on them and the police depend on them that might explain why they have more power
5882565 they have a major role combating terrorism but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties
5882566 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5882567 indeed mr obama appeared to misstate his position on saturday when he said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level his campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law those concerns did not exist for the federal bill because there is no federal abortion law
5882568 his rise from obscurity to international stardom his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman and his hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable
5882569 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5882570 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5882571 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5882572 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5882573 the politics of fear are fuelling a downward spiral of human rights abuses in which no right is sacrosanct and no person safe
5882574 rarely has democracy been so acclaimed yet so breached so promoted yet so disrespected so important yet so disappointing
5882575 arrest need it be said that it is a breaking point in your life a bolt of lightning which has scored a direct hit on you
5882576 we are getting vital information necessary to do our jobs and that is to protect the american people and our allies
5882577 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5882578 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5882579 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5882580 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5882581 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting

5882583 temerea mea este ca aceasta intirziere cu anii a executiei lucrarilor inseamna costuri in plus nu este in regula acest lucru si trebuie ca institutiile abilitate ale statului sa verifice aceste aspecte
5882584 lucreaza impotriva oricarei legi si in bataie de joc ei nu respecta nici o legislatie si nici termenele ar trebui ca zilnic sa verificam cum se executa lucrarile si macar de rusine vor grabi modernizarea
5882585 noua ni se cere sa lucram dupa standarde europene or de ce nu ar fi valabil si ca firmele straine care lucreaza in romania sa respecte aceleasi standarde care ni se cer si noua

5882608 ceausescu nu avea nici o simpatie pentru reformele dorite de alexander dubcek
5882609 singura lui grija era sa impiedice o eventuala ingerinta a moscovei in treburile pc roman temindu se mai ales ca leonid berjnev sa nu incerce sa il inlocuiasca cu un lider prosovietic
5882610 intrarea trupelor a cinci tari socialiste in cehoslovacia reprezinta o greseala si un grav pericol pentru pacea in europa este un moment rusinos pentru istoria miscarii socialiste
5882611 se spune ca cehoslovacia risca sa se confrunte cu o contrarevolutie dar de cind reprezinta democratia socialista un pericol
5882612 poporul roman nu va permite nimanui sa ii incalce teritoriul patriei
5882613 totusi ceausescu nu avea nimic dintr un lider reformist dimpotriva era un stalinist mai radical decit insusi bejnev
5882614 incepind din acel moment orice critica impotriva sa era considerata un act antipatriotic
5882615 theres no turning back as our rights advance because they are part of a much bigger crusade for human rights in the western world

5882625 stigmatizarea il poate face pe pacient minios sau suparat si ii poate face pe cei din jur sa inteleaga gresit boala psihica dar in timp ce stigmatizarea din boala mintala poate fi dureroasa si rusinoasa pacientul poate gasi modalitati sa se descurce cu ea sau sa o combata
5882626 discutiile deschise pot ajuta la disparitia stigmatizarii totusi nu toate lucrurile sint rele astazi stigmatizarea ce inconjoara tulburarile psihice se erodeaza incet acest lucru se datoreaza in parte intelegerii bolii mintale de catre public si a bazelor biologice pe care multe dintre acestea le au pe masura ce se descopera cauzele afectiunilor mintale si tratamente mai bune stigmatizarea ar putea sa scada si mai mult in plus multe persoane celebre si oameni publici au discutat deschis experientele proprii cu diverse afectiuni psihice acest lucru poate ajuta la scoaterea afectunilor psihice din coltul rusinii pacientul cu afectiuni psihice poate decide cui sa spuna despre suferinta daca sa spuna si cit sa spuna poate sa se simta mai bine daca nu spune nimic nimanui despre boala pe de alta parte daca pacientul se confeseaza persoanelor in care are incredere ar putea gasi compasiunea suportul si acceptarea de care are multa nevoie unii pacienti isi doresc sa combata activ stigmatizarea altii s ar putea simti bine doar daca ii fac pe cei dragi constienti de boala psihica reamintindu le cit de daunatoare sint glumele si stereotipurile iar pentru pacientii care se simt in stare sa si asume incercari si riscuri mai mari pot decide sa si faca cunoscut propriul caz

5882628 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
5882629 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
5882630 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5882631 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5882632 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals

5882684 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
5882685 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues

5882687 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5882698 avem 25 de locuri pentru ciini si alte 10 locuri pentru pisici putem caza animale atit in interior cit si in exteriorul cladirii avem loc de joaca amenajat pentru catei si propunem hrana adecvata in functie de rasa virsta si posibilele afectiuni primim la noi doar animalele vaccinate si deparazitate
5882699 avem catei care stau la noi si de 5 ani de obicei s au comportat mai putin placut in familie au muscat iar stapinii i au adus aici pina cind va fi gata casa la curte spre exemplu pongo are 10 ani si sta la noi de la virsta de 5 ani de asemenea perioade mai indelungate sint cazate si animalele unor clienti din strainatate prefera sa le lase la noi decit sa se complice cu pasaporturi pentru animale si implantarea de microcipuri
5882700 as dori sa explice un medic specialist ce este triplu test de ce se efectueaza acesta si cum ar trebui interpretat sint insarcinata si am cinci saptamini de sarcina pina acum lucrurile sint bune dar medicul mi a spus ca ar trebui sa fac un triplu test si poate chiar si o amniocenteza ca sa evit riscul de a naste un copil cu sindrom down triplul test depisteaza doar aceasta boala va multumesc
5882701 triplul test este probabil cel mai important test neinvaziv facut in scopul detectarii anumitor afectiuni fetale ca de exemplu malformatiile de tub neural sint incluse malformatiile de coloana vertebrala si unele malformatii ale capului trisomia 18 sindrom edwards si bineinteles trisomia 21 sindromul down

5882706 first the dollar started to carve out a bottom last march and has occurred even as the news flow and financial events over here have remained downbeat but the reason for the rebound in the greenback is that economic conditions overseas are deteriorating across a broad front
5882707 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5882708 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5882709 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact

5882713 this gold has a different meaning i have always made little mistakes and been nervous in big events but this time i controlled myself better and did what my coaches wanted me to do
5882714 when i was young my condition was not very good in the platform i could not perform very well and i changed coaches many times

5882720 i am starting to become concerned again we are not coming out of the housing slump
5882721 lower rates and time are not fixing the credit crisis we are about to begin what looks like a prolonged journey to the bottom of the economic sea and it is hard to find a happy face on wall street
5882722 it isnt even obvious that the worst is over the latest turmoil among the gses fannie and freddie and the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling banks will have to refinance lots of their maturing bonds during the second half of this year they will have to pay higher yields and that will force them to raise their lending rates

5882743 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5882744 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5882745 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5882746 the four seasons are blue collar kids who had a dream and it sort of crosses all barriers and boundaries
5882747 every person whos had a dream and thought long and hard to achieve it their success is an example of that
5882748 as far as the auditions went there were endless endless times when i was turned down so i did struggle but i also was able to achieve great things

5882751 dancap has failed to meet the test for an interlocutory injunction
5882752 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
5882753 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
5882754 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments
5882755 he says that key brand has the right to sell and that we have a binding agreement to purchase
5882756 id like to spend my time in the theatres not in the courts
5882757 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5882758 i did quite a few run throughs to practise and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5882759 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5882760 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5882761 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert cubby broccoli to tell him
5882762 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5882763 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5882764 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5882765 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5882766 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
5882767 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5882768 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5882769 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5882770 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5882771 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5882772 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5882773 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5882774 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5882775 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5882776 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade
5882777 i broke every law on the planet to get more dope
5882778 what got me clean was a hammer over my head
5882779 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5882780 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate
5882781 i will assess it this fall we are during the summer and there are byelections to win
5882782 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5882783 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5882784 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5882785 and today he said that this government is so terrible that it should be removed from office at any time hes just not sure when
5882786 harpers telling you hes not going to wait for an election
5882787 the liberals have been rolling over on their backs like kitties saying pet me
5882788 so we havent seen any disruption weve seen a government hell bent on having an election and has been hell bent on it for quite a while
5882789 it looks to me like hes been able to get virtually everything through with the help of the liberals
5882790 if i realize that stephen harper has the intention to go ahead with a right wing agenda that is not good for quebec the bloc quebecois will use its first opposition day to table a non confidence motion
5882791 demands full and immediate compliance with the ceasefire to which the parties have subscribed
5882792 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities on august 7 and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5882793 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5882794 we have made a lot of efforts to find a solution
5882795 but commitments have to be respected and implemented and thats what we will be talking about particularly the commitment undertaken by russia to withdraw its forces back to its positions before hostilities began
5882796 we are very concerned that this has not taken place yet
5882797 we decided to go for a short effective text to try to move things forward
5882798 our president has made absolutely clear that all six topics should be included in the resolution

5882838 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

5882841 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity
5882842 i wanted to make sure that if i left i would be going to a place that would be a destination for my family and allow me to build a program for the long haul with the same security
5882843 i appreciate the confidence that president mcrobbie and the university have shown in me by offering the two additional years to the agreement
5882844 it is a great responsibility to lead this program and i look forward to the challenge of bringing the program the respect it deserves the process of restoring this great program is going to take a lot of time more than probably any of us anticipated
5882845 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5882846 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
5882847 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off but obamas are not budging mccains numbers

5882891 our countrys greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states when we do send our men and women into harms way we must also clearly define the mission prescribe concrete political and military objectives seek out advice of our military commanders evaluate the intelligence plan accordingly and ensure that our troops have the resources support and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission
5882892 the time to fix our broken immigration system is now we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace but for reform to work we also must respond to what pulls people to america where we can reunite families we should where we can bring in more foreign born workers with the skills our economy needs we should
5882893 from the first moment a woman dared to speak that hope dared to believe that the american dream was meant for her too ordinary women have taken on extraordinary odds to give their daughters the chance for something else for a life more equal more free and filled with more opportunity than they ever had in so many ways we have succeeded but in so many areas we have much work left to do
5882894 americans work harder than the people of any other wealthy nation we are willing to tolerate more economic instability and are willing to take more personal risks to get ahead but we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance and if we know our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall

5882918 last year we gathered here to lay the foundation stone and what was there then to be seen nothing but rubbish and stones and bricks and ruins of an old building that had been pulled down there we laid the foundation stone and very few knew what the building was that was to rise no one know it perfectly in every detail except one man the architect in his mind it was all clear and as the contractor and the mason and the carpenter came to their work they took their orders from him and the humblest laborer had to be obedient to orders and the structure rose and this beautiful building has been completed and just so
5882919 this building that we open today is but laying the foundation of a work of which only god knows what is to become
5882920 what is done in the will of god the strength of god will not be withheld from it what is done in the will of god must have the mighty blessing of god
5882921 it must all come direct from heaven we are in fellowship with the risen lord we must have a close union with him and somehow he will let us know what he wants
5882922 we are thy servants and in fasting and prayer we wait upon thee what is thy will for us
5882923 separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them the work is mine and i care for it and i have chosen these men and called them and i want you who represent the church of christ upon earth to set them apart unto me
5882924 we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit that is of god
5882925 father let the holy ghost have full dominion over me in my home in my temper in every word of my tongue in every thought of my heart in every feeling toward my fellow men let the holy spirit have entire possession
5882926 having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
5882927 god forgive me that i have not honored the holy spirit as i should have done that i have grieved him that i have allowed self and the flesh and my own will to work where the holy ghost should have been honored may god forgive me that i have allowed self and the flesh and the will actually to have the place that god wanted the holy ghost to have
5882928 and ben hadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it
5882929 my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have
5882930 oh i have passed through so much trial and suffering and there is so much of the self life still remaining and i dare not face the entire giving of it up because i know it will cause so much trouble and agony
5882931 it is god that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure
5882932 for this cause have i raised thee up for to show in thee my power
5882933 oh my desire is not strong enough i am not willing for everything that may come i do not feel bold enough to say i can conquer everything
5882934 my god i am willing that thou shouldst make me willing
5882935 if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth
5882936 lord i yield myself in absolute surrender to my god
5882937 i do not feel the power i do not feel the determination i do not feel the assurance
5882938 i have often been stirred at a meeting or at a convention and i have consecrated myself to god but it has passed away i know it may last for a week or for a month but away it fades and after a time it is all gone
5882939 by thy grace i desire to do thy will in everything every moment of every day
5882940 lord god not a word upon my tongue but for thy glory not a movement of my temper but for thy glory not an affection of love or hate in my heart but for thy glory and according to thy blessed will
5882941 i give myself absolutely to god to his will to do only what god wants
5882942 i give myself absolutely to god to let him work in me to will and to do of his good pleasure as he has promised to do
5882943 my lord o king according to thy word i am thine and all that i have
5882944 o god i accept thy demands i am thine and all that i have absolute surrender is what my soul yields to thee by divine grace
5882945 anything to bring me to separation to death for a life of full fellowship with god and christ
5882946 and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882947 how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
5882948 if it is so difficult to enter the kingdom who then can be saved
5882949 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882950 i was not watchful enough i did not make my resolutions strong enough
5882951 am i not a regenerate man have i not the life of god within me
5882952 yes and i have christ to help me i can live the holy life
5882953 i must do it and i will do it it is impossible for man and yet i must do it
5882954 lord what is the meaning of this how am i to be freed from the power of sin
5882955 i delight in the law of god after the inward man to will what is good is present with me my heart loves the law of god and my will has chosen that law
5882956 it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do
5882957 to will is present with me but to do i find i cannot do i will but i cannot perform
5882958 it is impossible for me my god let there be an end of the flesh and all its powers an end of self and lot it be my glory to be helpless
5882959 my hearts desire and delight o god is absolute surrender but i cannot perform it it is impossible for me to live that life it is beyond me
5882960 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882961 i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my preaching was in demonstration of the spirit and of power
5882962 i am god almighty walk before me and be thou perfect
5882963 i can do nothing god must and will do all
5882964 in worship in work in sanctification in obedience to god i can do nothing of myself and so my place is to worship the omnipotent god and to believe that he will work in me every moment
5882965 amen the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882966 ah there is the self life there is the flesh life that rules in me
5882967 o god it is impossible to me man cannot do it but glory to thy name it is possible with god
5882968 amen i accept the message of absolute surrender to god
5882969 will that ever be mine can i count upon god to make me one of whom it shall be said in heaven and on earth and in hell he lives in absolute surrender to god
5882970 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882971 i am in gods charge my god is working out my life for me
5882972 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882973 that he would grant you according to riches of his glory
5882974 to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man
5882975 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5882976 this message has spoken to me about a love utterly beyond my power it is absolutely impossible
5882977 who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think unto him be glory
5882978 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish
5882979 having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
5882980 oh god our spiritual life is not what it should be
5882981 i want you to grow to abound to increase more and more
5882982 i pray god that you may abound more and more i write to you to increase more and more
5882983 if the church will return to acknowledge that the holy spirit is her strength and her help and if the church will return to give up everything and wait upon god to be filled with the spirit her days of beauty and gladness will return and we shall see the glory of god revealed among us
5882984 nothing will help you unless you come to understand that you must live every day under the power of the holy ghost
5882985 how did you receive the holy spirit was it by the preaching of the law or by the preaching of faith
5882986 yes we have got the holy ghost accepting christ by faith by faith we received the holy spirit
5882987 i cannot speak to you as to spiritual men you ought to be spiritual men but you are carnal
5882988 where are marks of the presence of the spirit of the lamb of god
5882989 we have grieved gods spirit we have tried to be christian churches with as little as possible of gods spirit we have not sought to be churches filled with the holy ghost
5882990 we are too feeble and too helpless and we try to obey and we vow to obey but somehow we fail
5882991 alas my life knows but little of the power of the holy ghost
5882992 why is it that i fail so i did so solemnly vow with my whole heart and did desire to serve god why have i failed
5882993 my dear friend you are trying to do in your own strength what christ alone can do in you
5882994 i am sure i knew christ alone could do it i was not trusting in myself
5882995 you were trusting in yourself or you could not have failed if you had trusted christ he could not fail
5882996 i must have the holy spirit sanctifying my whole inner life if i am really to live for gods glory
5882997 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
5882998 even as i have loved you so love ye one another
5882999 by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another
5883000 i give you a badge and that badge is love that is to be your mark it is the only thing in heaven or on earth by which men can know me
5883001 no what we have heard of the church of christ is that there is not a place where there is no quarreling and separation
5883002 the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts
5883003 that is a new commandment the one commandment love one another as i have loved you
5883004 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering
5883005 no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us
5883006 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen
5883007 lord let love from heaven flow down into my heart i am giving up my life to pray and live as one who has given himself up for the everlasting love to dwell in and fill him
5883008 i work for christ and i feel i could work much harder but i have not the gift i do not know how or where to begin i do not know what i can do
5883009 she has been into the house thirty or forty times and she has always gone away again nothing can be done with her she is so low and hard
5883010 we have been waiting for you and the company is assembled and you have only an hour for the address
5883011 o lord my lack of heart my lack of love i confess it
5883012 the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
5883013 ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear
5883014 it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
5883015 i delight in the law of the lord after the inward man
5883016 it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
5883017 i delight in the law of god after the inward man
5883018 i will to do what is good but the power to perform i find not
5883019 to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not
5883020 how is it god makes a regenerate man utter such a confession with a right will with a heart that longs to do good and longs to do its very utmost to love god
5883021 i am a regenerate child of god but i am utterly helpless to obey his law
5883022 i see another law in my members bringing me into captivity
5883023 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
5883024 it is not i that do it but i am under the awful power of sin which is holding me down it is i and yet not i alas alas it is myself so closely am i bound up with it and so closely is it intertwined with my very nature
5883025 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
5883026 if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
5883027 i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
5883028 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
5883029 the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
5883030 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me
5883031 i thank god through jesus christ the law of the spirit hath set me free from the law of sin and of death
5883032 if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh ye shall live
5883033 o god must i go on sinning this way forever who shall deliver me o wretched man that i am from the body of this death
5883034 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
5883035 i a wretched man thank god through jesus christ even though i do not see it all i am going to praise god
5883036 come branch of the vine i want to learn from you how i can be a true branch of the living vine
5883037 man i hear that you are wise and i know that you can do a great many wonderful things i know you have much strength and wisdom given to you but i have one lesson for you with all your hurry and effort in christs work you never prosper the first thing you need is to come and rest in your lord jesus that is what i do since i grew out of that vine i have spent years and years and all i have done is just to rest in the vine when the time of spring came i had no anxious thought or care the vine began to pour its sap into me and to give the bud and leaf and when the time of summer came i had no care and in the great heat i trusted the vine to bring moisture to keep me fresh and in the time of harvest when the owner came to pluck the grapes i had no care if there was anything in the grapes not good the owner never blamed the branch the blame was always on the vine and if you would be a true branch of christ the living vine just rest on him let christ bear the responsibility
5883038 the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit
5883039 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit
5883040 i am the vine and my father is the husbandman my father is the husbandman who has charge of me and you
5883041 we need not only more workers but we need our workers to have a new power a different life that we workers should be able to bring more blessing
5883042 lord jesus nothing less than the sap that flows through thyself nothing less than the spirit of thy divine life is what we ask lord jesus i pray thee let thy spirit flow through me in all my work for thee
5883043 o christ it is this i long for it is this i choose
5883044 have you anything to do little branch besides bearing grapes
5883045 and now what do you understand little branch about your relationship to the vine
5883046 my relationship is just this i am utterly given up to the vine and the vine can give me as much or as little sap as it chooses here i am at its disposal and the vine can do with me what it likes
5883047 lord it is my desire to give up myself entirely to thee
5883048 yes as true as it is of that little branch of the vine so true by gods grace i would have it to be of me i would live day by day that christ may be able to do with me what he will
5883049 i have my business and family duties and my relationships as a citizen and all this i cannot change and now alongside all this i am to take in religion and the service of god as something that will keep me from sin god help me to perform my duties properly
5883050 lord is there anything in me that is not according to thy will that has not been ordered by thee or that is not entirely given up to thee
5883051 lord everything in my life has to be in most complete harmony with my position as a branch of thee the blessed vine
5883052 absolute surrender to thee o christ is what i have chosen
5883053 i the living one who have so completely given myself to you am the vine you cannot trust me too much i am the almighty worker full of a divine life and power
5883054 i am the vine i will receive you i will draw you to myself i will bless you i will strengthen you i will fill you with my spirit i the vine have taken you to be my branches i have given myself utterly to you children give yourselves utterly to me i have surrendered myself as god absolutely to you i became man and died for you that i might be entirely yours come and surrender yourselves entirely to be mine
5883055 he is my vine and i am his branches i want nothing more now i have the everlasting vine
5883056 thou art my vine and i am thy branch it is enough my soul is satisfied
5883057 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation
5883058 i want to leave my children a large inheritance and i am keeping it for them
5883059 poor man he is keeping an inheritance for his children but he is not keeping or preparing his children for the inheritance
5883060 when you go to europe i will let you take it with you but mind you keep it safely and bring it back
5883061 ah but i gave you that watch on condition that you would keep it
5883062 but i did not want you to keep it in that general way so that you should bring me back only the shell of the watch or the remains i expected you to keep every part of it
5883063 i must now leave you to go and earn your own money and to get your livelihood for yourself
5883064 my child there is no work you are to do and no business in which you are engaged and not a cent which you are to spend but i your father will take that up into my keeping
5883065 ah in time of trial god keeps me but in times of prosperity i do not need his keeping then i forget him and let him go
5883066 in time of prosperity when things are smooth and quiet i am able to cling to god but when heavy trials come somehow or other my will rebels and god does not keep me then
5883067 god will keep me from doing very great wickedness but there are small sins i cannot expect god to keep me from there is the sin of temper i cannot expect god to conquer that
5883068 he can but there is something in me that cannot attain to it and which god does not take away
5883069 is there any sin that my god cannot keep me from
5883070 you can have as much money as you want for your undertaking
5883071 for a week or a month god has kept me very wonderfully i have lived in the light of his countenance and i cannot say what joy i have not had in fellowship with him he has blessed me in my work for others he has given me souls and at times i felt as if i were carried heavenward eagle wings but it did not continue it was too good it could not last
5883072 it was necessary that i should fall to keep me humble
5883073 i know it was my own fault but somehow you cannot always live up in the heights
5883074 do you think god is able to keep you one day from actual transgression
5883075 i not only know he is able to do it but i think he has done it there have been days in which he has kept my heart in his holy presence when though i have always had a sinful nature within me he has kept me from conscious actual transgression
5883076 i the lord do keep it and will water it every moment
5883077 it is god that worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure
5883078 lord i am going to expect thee to do thy utmost and i am going to trust thee day by day to keep me absolutely
5883079 i give up everything i have tried and longed and thought and prayed but failure has come god has blessed me and helped me but still in the long run there has been so much of sin and sadness
5883080 no it is possible that you might exalt yourself and therefore i have sent you this trial to keep you weak and humble
5883081 that is the wrong way you must come down this way that stair is locked up
5883082 i have learned a lesson that going down is often the best way to get up
5883083 i believe what you say but there is one difficulty if my trust were perfect and always abiding all would come right for i know god will honor trust but how am i to get that trust
5883084 by the death of self the great hindrance to trust is self effort so long as you have got your own wisdom and thoughts and strength you cannot fully trust god but when god breaks you down when everything begins to grow dim before your eyes and you see that you understand nothing then god is coming nigh and if you will bow down in nothingness and wait upon god he will become all
5883085 thy word is enough kept by the power of god
5883086 my life is one of such scurry and bustle that i have no time for fellowship with god
5883087 people do not know how we missionaries are tempted i get up at five oclock in the morning and there are the natives waiting for their orders for work then i have to go to the school and spend hours there and then there is other work and sixteen hours rush along and i hardly get time to be alone with god
5883088 oh god make me as holy as a pardoned sinner can be made
5883089 all that that omnipotence can do i am going to trust my god for
5883090 a lot of people in business have given up writing the documents they just write the presentations which are summaries without the detail without the backup a lot of people dont like the intellectual rigor of actually doing the work
5883091 credi di avermi deluso ma ti dar ancora pi passione il cuore il letto il mondo luniverso sospesi in una bolla di sapone
5883092 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5883093 i can only offer this final apology historical materialism can and should be applied to all social phenomena
5883094 whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me
5883095 if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town
5883096 therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely a missionary people need encouragement to persevere in the work of christ with us
5883097 life is not about falling down its about getting up and trying again
5883098 one with christ one with each other and one in ministry to all the world
5883099 proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof
5883100 one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
5883101 i have not come to bring peace but a sword
5883102 for i have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter in law against her mother in law and ones foes will be members of ones own household
5883103 whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me those who find their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it
5883104 those who find their life ego will lose it and those who lose their life ego for my sake will find it eternal life
5883105 the wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit
5883106 indeed the same spirit who invested jesus with his power is the spirit who descended on the apostles on pentecost and is now working in the world the human task is to cooperate with god in what god is already doing
5883107 i could have gotten in from three different people but who it really pissed off was the person i was dating at the time

5883113 my group of jews doesnt like the way youve been treating us im not going to say that its wrong to be a nazi or that you are all terrible people or anything like that but what i am trying to say is that you should treat us better because we are still people like you and we dont appreciate the way were being handled i understand the path that you have chosen but that doesnt mean you can all act like jerks to us
5883114 i was going to work today but then i decided fuck it

5883426 abrahams faith was tested when god asked him to give everything faith cannot be less than total to trust in god means to look to him alone to find in him all our hope to hold nothing back no reserve yet because faith looks to god and not to ourselves faiths giving is really a receiving in commitment the price faith pays is everything but in total trust the price is nothing faith looks to god not man as the giver

5883439 this the first of his signs jesus did at cana in galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him
5883440 now jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
5883441 our pastor doesnt proclaim to us what the bible says and means the messages are not revelations of the glory of christ they are advice talks with a religious twist

5883488 its laughable that moore attempts to portray himself as an anti establishment liberal who is the voice of the common folk when in fact he is no better than the greedy capitalists he shuns maybe now that he has made millions of dollars off the blood of our children he could toss a dvd or two our way to view
5883489 i am completely against him he screwed me over i had no idea what moores agenda was and he had an agenda he had it all planned out completely i believe that every american has the right to have a gun we should have the right to protect ourselves
5883490 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
5883491 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
5883492 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
5883493 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
5883494 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
5883495 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
5883496 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
5883497 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
5883498 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
5883499 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
5883500 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
5883501 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
5883502 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
5883503 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
5883504 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
5883505 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
5883506 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
5883507 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
5883508 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
5883509 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
5883510 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
5883511 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
5883512 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
5883513 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone

5883520 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5883521 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories

5883672 never mind that thomas already had been confirmed by the senate to three different positions including the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the second most prestigious court in the land after the u s supreme court before he was nominated to the supreme court
5883673 never mind that he had accomplished all this after overcoming more personal adversity than any other sitting justice has endured sen obamas comment simply ignored facts and history
5883674 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5883675 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5883676 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5883677 his is a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually

5883689 my stars this piece is definitely an example of using imagery in my work that represents a major psychic shift which i shall now take several hours to inscribe in my journal after which i shall develop a dozen sketches furthering this theme to see where it leads me followed by a thorough analysis of all that data so i can compose a new schema to inform how i approach making my art in the immediate future
5883690 for we know that if our earthly house this tent is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands
5883691 god who made the world and everything in it since he is lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in temples made with hands nor is he worshiped with mens hands as though he needed anything since he gives to all life breath and all things and he has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined their pre appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings so they should seek the lord in the hope that they might grope for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as also some of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring therefore since we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone something shaped by art and mans devising truly these times of ignorance god overlooked but now commands all men everywhere to repent because he has appointed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained he has given assurance of this to all by raising him from the dead

5883719 tom i p 143 dr hammond another protestant divine explains it in the same manner
5883720 what is here meant by the keys is best understand by isaias xxii 22 where they signified ruling the whole family or house of the king and this being by christ accommodated to the church denotes the power of governing it
5883721 in a preceding part of scripture jesus sending his apostles commanded them to publish his coming but here he seems to give a contrary mandate tell no one amp c but in my opinion it is one thing to preach the christ and another to preach christ jesus for christ is a name of dignity but jesus is the particular name of the redeemer
5883722 and strangers shall come from the east and from the west and the north and the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god and behold they are last that shall be first and they are first that shall be last

5883735 we will be okay there is usually an increase in litigation which will help our business
5883736 onze heer verleen ons uw genade en bereid ons een weg naar vrede en voorspoed uit onze beproeving
5883737 onze heer is de heer der hemelen en der aarde nimmer zullen wij een andere god aanroepen naast hem anders zouden wij inderdaad een grote dwaasheid begaan
5883738 dit ons volk heeft goden genomen naast hem waarom brengen zij voor hen geen duidelijk bewijs en wie is onrechtvaardiger dan hij die een leugen over allah verzint
5883739 wanneer gij u van hen en van hetgeen zij nevens allah aanbidden verwijdert neemt dan uw toevlucht tot de spelonk en uw heer zal zijn barmhartigheid jegens u vermeerderen en uw aangelegenheden gunstig doen verlopen
5883740 wij zijn een dag of een gedeelte van een dag gebleven
5883741 uw god weet het best hoe lang gij hier gebleven zijt het is beter n van ons met deze zilveren munt naar de stad te zenden en laat hij zien wat het beste voedsel is en hiervan levensmiddelen meebrengen en laat hij zich vriendelijk gedragen en niemand omtrent ons inlichten
5883742 want indien zij over jullie te weten komen zullen zij jullie stenigen of trachten jullie te bekeren tot hun godsdienst en jullie zullen nimmer kunnen slagen
5883743 wij zullen voorzeker een bedehuis boven hen boven hun graf oprichten
5883744 er waren er drie en de vierde was hun hond
5883745 er waren er vijf en de zesde was hun hond
5883746 mijn heer kent hun getal het beste niemand kent hen enkelen uitgezonderd
5883747 ik hoop dat mijn heer mij nog dichter dan thans naar de rechte weg zal leiden
5883748 het is de waarheid van uw heer laat daarom geloven die geloven wil en niet geloven die niet wil
5883749 ik ben rijker dan gij aan bezit en in getal
5883750 noch denk ik dat het uur zal komen indien ik tot mijn heer word teruggebracht zal ik voorzeker een betere plaats vinden dan dit
5883751 gelooft gij niet in hem die u schiep uit stof daarna uit een levenskiem en u dan vormde tot een volledig mens
5883752 wat mij betreft het is allah die mijn heer is ik zal niemand met mijn heer vereenzelvigen
5883753 waarom zeidet gij niet toen gij de tuin binnentraadt het is zoals het allah behaagt er is geen god dan allah indien gij mij als uw mindere in rijkdom en nakomelingen ziet
5883754 waarschijnlijk zal mijn heer mij iets beters geven dan uw tuin en bliksemstralen uit de hemel doen nederdalen op de uwe waardoor deze grond kaal wordt
5883755 of het water er van in de grond doen zinken waardoor gij niet in staat zult zijn het te bereiken
5883756 wee ons wat voor een boek is dit het slaat klein noch groot over doch het somt alles op
5883757 roept degenen waarvan gij beweerdet dat zij mijn deelgenoten waren
5883758 ik zal het niet opgeven voordat ik de samenvloeiing van twee zee n heb bereikt al moet ik eeuwenlang voortgaan
5883759 breng ons het ochtendmaal waarlijk vermoeidheid heeft ons bevangen vanwege onze reis
5883760 zie toen wij ons op de rots begaven vergat ik de vis en slechts satan deed mij vergeten er over te spreken en de vis vond op bewonderenswaardige wijze zijn weg naar de zee
5883761 mag ik u volgen dat gij mij onderwijst in de leiding die u is gegeven
5883762 want hoe kunt gij geduldig zijn over dingen die uw begrip te boven gaan
5883763 indien het gode behaagt zult gij mij geduldig vinden en ik zal aan uw bevel niet ongehoorzaam zijn
5883764 welaan dan indien gij mij wenst te volgen stel mij nergens vragen over eer ik zelf daaromtrent tot u spreek
5883765 hebt gij er een gat in gemaakt teneinde de opvarenden er van te doen verdrinken voorwaar gij hebt iets gruwelijks bedreven
5883766 had ik u niet gezegd dat gij stellig geen geduld met mij zoudt kunnen tonen
5883767 maak mij geen verwijt omdat ik het vergeten ben en maak het mij niet moeilijk
5883768 hebt gij een onschuldige gedood die niemand had vermoord voorwaar gij hebt een afkeurenswaardige daad begaan
5883769 zei ik u niet dat gij nimmer in staat zoudt zijn mij met geduld te vergezellen
5883770 indien ik u wederom iets vraag houd mij dan niet in uw gezelschap dan hebt gij zeker een verontschuldiging van mijn kant
5883771 indien gij wildet hadt gij er loon voor kunnen vragen
5883772 dit is de scheiding tussen u en mij ik zal u thans de verklaring geven van datgene waarvoor gij geen geduld kondet tonen
5883773 wat de boot betreft deze behoorde aan arme lieden die op de rivier werkten en ik verkoos haar onbruikbaar te maken want achter hen was een koning die alle goede schepen met geweld in beslag wilde nemen
5883774 en wat de jongeling betreft zijn ouders waren gelovigen en wij vreesden dat hij schande over hen zou brengen door zijn opstandigheid en ongeloof
5883775 derhalve wensten wij dat hun heer hun in zijn plaats een ander kind zou schenken dat reiner en zachtmoediger zou zijn dan hij
5883776 en wat de muur betreft deze behoorde aan twee weesjongens in de stad en daaronder lag hun schat begraven hun vader was een rechtvaardig man derhalve behaagde het uw heer dat zij volwassen zouden worden en dan hun schat zouden opgraven als een genade van uw heer en dit alles deed ik niet uit mezelf dit is de verklaring van datgene waarvoor gij geen geduld kondet tonen
5883777 o zol qarnain bestraf hen of behandel hen met vriendelijkheid
5883778 wat betreft degene die kwaad doet hem zullen wij straffen daarna zal hij worden teruggebracht tot zijn heer die hem straffen zal met een gestrengere straf
5883779 doch wat hem betreft die gelooft en oprecht handelt hij zal een goede beloning ontvangen en wij zullen hem op ons bevel alle gemakken verschaffen
5883780 o zol qarnain gog en magog stichten onheil op aarde mogen wij u dan schatting betalen mits gij een afscheiding tussen hen en ons opricht
5883781 de macht waarmee mijn heer mij heeft bekleed is beter doch gij kunt mij met lichamelijke kracht helpen ik zal tussen u en hen een sterke afscheiding oprichten
5883782 brengt mij gesmolten koper opdat ik het er overheen giete
5883783 zullen wij u verhalen omtrent degenen die het grootste verlies in hun werken zullen lijden
5883784 al ware de oceaan inkt voor de woorden van mijn heer zo zou de oceaan zijn uitgeput eer de woorden van mijn heer ten einde komen zelfs al zouden wij er evenveel ter aanvulling toevoegen
5883785 ik ben slechts een mens gelijk gij doch mij wordt geopenbaard dat uw god slechts n god is laat daarom degene die op de ontmoeting met zijn heer hoopt goede daden verrichten en bij de aanbidding van zijn heer niemand anders met hem vereenzelvigen
5883786 dit is een tovenaar en een leugenaar 5 heeft hij van vele goden n god gemaakt dit is voorzeker iets eigenaardigs
5883787 gaat voort en houdt u aan uw goden dit is voorzeker gewenst 7 wij hebben hieromtrent in de laatste godsdienst niets gehoord dit is niets anders dan een verzinsel 8 aan hem is onder ons de vermaning gezonden
5883788 onze heer geef ons spoedig ons deel v r de dag der afrekening
5883789 vrees niet wij zijn twee procesvoerders waarvan de ene de ander onrecht heeft aangedaan spreek daarom recht tussen ons in waarheid en handel niet onrechtvaardig en leid ons naar het rechte pad
5883790 deze is mijn broeder hij heeft negen en negentig ooien en ik heb maar n ooi toch zegt hij geef haar aan mij en hij was mij in het dispuut de baas
5883791 voorzeker hij heeft u onrecht aangedaan door uw ooi te eisen naast zijn eigen ooien en voorzeker vele der mededingers doen elkaar onrecht aan met uitzondering van hen die geloven en goede werken doen en zij zijn slechts weinigen
5883792 o david wij hebben u als stedehouder op aarde aangewezen spreek daarom recht over de mensen naar waarheid en volg hun begeerten niet anders zullen zij u van de weg van allah afleiden
5883793 ik houd van goede dingen vanwege de gedachtenis aan mijn heer

5883920 women of the south had been openly and violently rebellious from the moment they thought their states rights touched they incited the men to struggle in support of their views and whether right or wrong sustained them nobly to the end they were the first to rebel and the last to succumb
5883921 rosana osterman the levy sisters and the natchez m a yer daughters were not of course recent immigrants but rather the american born descendants of earlier migrant generations but they like jews throughout the country both newly arrived and long established saw themselves as wholehearted americans and fashioned their lives and identities in response to an american reality quite unlike anything jews had ever experienced elsewhere
5883922 the southern jewesses were fanatically almost hysterically passionate in their sympathies for their new regime were they trying to prove that they were more ardent than their neighbors why
5883923 american women knew nothing of war believed less in the cruelties and fearful vindictiveness of the federal governm en t thus the southern women gave free expression to the feelings which habit had made but second nature and spoke of their hatred and determination to sustain their rights by encouraging in their husbands sons and fathers every resistance to tyranny exhibited by the republicans
5883924 the stove broken served us for table and washstand while a punch bowl grew into a washbasin two filthy straw mattresses kept us warm and yankee soldiers were placed at our bedroom door to prevent our escape
5883925 again i ask what is my crime if an ardent attachment to the land of my birth and expression of deepest sympathy with relatives and friends in the south constitute treason than i am indeed a traitor if hostility towards black republicanism its sentiment and policy it is a crime and i am self condemned
5883926 conniving careerist and political opportunist of major proportions who was given the title of beast by the confederacy for his severity during the early military occupation of new orleans
5883927 beast butler was the worst the union army had to offer he was nicknamed spoons for thiefery of spoons and silverware imputed to him and his soldiers
5883928 they were a tightly knit and highly organized nation who set themselves apart and defended themselves against others even when one of their group was wrong
5883929 been principally engaged in the occupations i e smuggling which caused the capture which has occasioned this correspondence
5883930 recognized that the perpetrators were generally young often pretty and interesting and frequently socially prominent the kind of individuals who would attract both attention and sympathy if harsh measures turned them into martyrs
5883931 a city could hardly be said to be under good government where such things were permitted
5883932 high spirited and intensely loyal to the confederacy she had been in trouble before when she was apprehended for espionage in washington this time not espionage but merriment was to prove her undoing
5883933 eugenia active in raising money for the widow of a man executed by butler for having hauled down the flag from the federal mint believed she was being prosecuted for her pro southern beliefs
5883934 you are seen laughing and mocking at the remains of a federal officer i do not call you a common woman of the town but an uncommonly vulgar one and i sentence you to ship island for the war
5883935 again my insolence aroused this son of liberty particularly as in reply to his accusation i had said i was in good spirits the day of the funeral
5883936 i noted that he took a mighty long time to write my sentence and i suspected that he hoped by delay i would throw myself on his mercy or beg his pardon or promise never to do so again nothing of this kind ever crossed my brain and full of holy indignation and determination to meet with silent contempt this outrageous insult i quietly folded my arms and looked on him while he wrote not a word of appeal or explanation broke the ominous silence my accuser had made the charge and sentenced me without judge or jury
5883937 having been once imprisoned for her traitorous proclivities and acts at washington and released by the clemency of the government and having been found training her children to spit on officers of the united states for which act of one of those children both her husband and herself apologized and were again forgiven she is now found on the balcony of her house during the passage of the funeral procession of lieut
5883938 the great gen butler sent once a week to inquire after my health he no doubt hoped i would at last cringe and beg thank god who gave me strength and patience to keep me from this black stain
5883939 the war which butler waged upon this jewess and other southern women made him the confederacys public enemy number one with a price upon his head
5883940 mrs phillips another beautiful and clever jewess has been put in prison again by beast butler for laughing as a yankee funeral procession went by
5883941 it was a sentence as harsh as it was sensational southerners talked of rescuing the lady but they lacked the necessary ships and found it impossible to carry out their chivalrous plan butler pardoned her in september two and a half months after her arrest but this action did not dispel the popular belief that he was a cruel tyrant
5883942 had shown considerable public relations acumen and her prison journal reveals an ironic sense of humor especially in her wry proposal to use a steam device to pump moisture into the rock hard bread though not exactly besting butler she had played the wily massachusetts politician to a draw
5883943 her proud southern spirit never quailed and she remained firm to the last in the opinions she had expressed
5883944 was so unswerving in her devotion to the confederate cause that the union suspected her of being a spy
5883945 how much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job

5884020 in the 19th century a woman who wanted to lose weight would ingest the eggs of parasitic worms
5884021 the eggs would hatch in the womans intestinal tract and the worms would take up residence there feasting on food as it passed by them the result was rapid weight loss for the woman followed by really big worms wriggling out of her anus at night in search of a better life it was a win win situation for both the woman and the worms
5884022 i see many obese children at the hospital every day
5884023 if children are obese they are likely to be obese as adults too and obese adults are much more likely to have obese children worms can break this cycle
5884024 parents can feed their children a steady diet of pizza fast food potato chips and candy bars and the kids wont gain an ounce of weight this will save parents a lot of time as they will no longer need to cook for their children
5884025 the child is likely to be surprised when he or she wakes up in the morning to find a pile of worms squirming around under the covers
5884026 when that happens parents should explain to their child that it is just undigested spaghetti from the time the family went to that nice italian restaurant theres no need for them to know they have worms

5884040 brandon marshall is doing great things the offensive line we have all new guys up there we have casey wiegmann in we have two guys on the outside the tackles ryan harris playing at a high level running backs anybody we are putting in there is rushing the ball well just the volume of plays and the formations we are throwing at them its been incredible how everyone has picked it up
5884041 weve got some young guys in there that have really stepped up
5884042 one of the reasons you can do that is because of the otas in the offseason you have 16 17 workouts and the offseason conditioning program this is kind of like your second camp this is the third time you are installing your offense and defense and these guys pick it up fairly quickly

5884046 if you go back and watch a lot of clips from three four or five years ago youll see a lot of empty sets
5884047 they were throwing the ball all over the place especially with john elway they threw their fair share of deep balls in empty sets right now with our running game when we get in those sets you are going to see limited amounts of defenses they have to prepare for our run and that kind of limits their blitz and what they can do if we go empty with their checks and stuff as long as we are running the ball we are going to be able to do things like that
5884048 week to week we will see what is working we will always be a running team so hopefully we can get that running game going and open up things on the outside

5884104 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo head s performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

5884117 only one offense is now vigorously punished an accurate observance of our fathers traditions for this cause the pious are driven from their countries and transported into the deserts the people are in lamentation joy and spiritual cheerfulness are no more our feasts are turned into mourning our houses of prayer are shut up our altars are deprived of spiritual worship no longer are there christians assembling teachers presiding saving instructions celebrations hymns by night or that blessed exultation of souls which arises from communion and fellowship of spiritual gifts the ears of the simple are led astray and have become accustomed to heretical profaneness the infants of the church are fed on the words of impiety for what can they do baptisms are in arian hands the care of travelers visitation of the sick consolation of mourners succors of the distressed which all being performed by them become a bond to the people so that in a little while even though liberty be granted us no hope will remain that they who are encompassed by so lasting a deceit should be brought back again to the acknowledgment of the truth

5884244 it says so much about us as one of this countrys largest manufacturing operations and most trusted brands
5884245 the next chapter in our history will see us delivering a wide range of energy solutions to meet varying consumer needs and budgets
5884246 i believe manufacturing the next million vehicles will be one of the most dynamic periods of gm holdens rich history

5884249 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good because his mercy endureth for ever

5884251 i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth
5884252 you should be more mature by now we shouldnt still be feeding you milk
5884253 those whose habits have exercised their senses to discern good from evil
5884254 so judas threw the money into the temple and left then he went and hanged himself

5884256 its been great seeing you glad things are going so well
5884257 you shall see heaven open up and angels ascending and descending on the son of man
5884258 i never feared him at all he was like my brother he was my best friend hes my only friend really
5884259 no daddy could you stay here with me daddy im afraid they told all these stories about demons
5884260 daddy daddy would you pray for me that i would be safe
5884261 aaron i will not pray for you to be safe i will pray that god will make you dangerous so dangerous that demons will flee when you enter the room
5884262 all right but pray i would be really really dangerous daddy
5884263 maybe itll take him quickly so we dont have to deal with him
5884264 well you know how santa claus turned out its probably just your dad
5884265 always be praying constantly at all times in all situations
5884266 never stop praying in the spirit listen constantly for his promptings so that you can take up the sword and defend the believers around you at a moments notice
5884267 panda large black and white bear like mammal native to china eats shoots and leaves
5884268 bigger is not always better providing free services indefinitely to complacent christians is not our mission
5884269 when your bottom line is saving souls you get impatient with people who interfere with that goal
5884270 before now we made people feel comfortable and welcome and tried to coax them to give a little something in return
5884271 i thought a church that doesnt allow wussies that rocks
5884272 its just that theyve never seen anyone like you before a man obviously tough whos not a gangster
5884273 the lack of effective functioning fathers is the root cause of americas social economic and spiritual crises
5884274 you sum up the whole of new testament teaching in a single phrase if you speak of it as a revelation of the fatherhood of the holy creator in the same way you sum up the whole of new testament religion if you describe it as the knowledge of god as ones holy father
5884275 if you want to judge how well a person understands christianity find out how much he makes of the thought of being gods child and having god as his father if this is not the thought that prompts and controls his worship and prayers and his whole outlook on life it means that he does not understand christianity very well at all
5884276 i just hope youre not heading down a path where at the end of the weekend youre going to ask us to make some kind of commitment to follow god with our whole lives
5884277 cause if you are i want to go home right now
5884278 ive been coming here for a long time and ive made these promises year after year promises i can never keep and ended up worse off than before i started with god even more mad at me cause now not only am i sinning but im breaking another promise i made to him and so i just want to make sure thats not where youre headed this weekend is it
5884279 every day when my dad came home from work the first thing he would always ask me was have you done your homework yet
5884280 for the first six months i did nothing to improve my lot in life i would eat all my meals alone in my room one day my father entered my room and said john winters coming and the storm windows need to be your job i want those hung by the time i get back this evening or else
5884281 then he turned walked out of the room and slammed the door
5884282 i got the windows up i found out later that never at any moment was my father more than four or five feet away from my side
5884283 dad i never really knew you we could have shared so much love together but you never had time for me
5884284 great job lenny way to go son keep going youre doing great
5884285 i tell you the truth the son can do nothing by himself he can do only what he sees his father doing because whatever the father does the son also does
5884286 as the father has loved me so have i loved you
5884287 come leland i think there are better things we can do with our money
5884288 if you have money you can tell anyone even the most established respected or powerful person in the world to go take a flying leap
5884289 my my this is what the lord might have done if hed had the money
5884290 kevin ive started to tithe and its been a great adventure
5884291 you dont know me but i was in a bad marriage my husband was beating me and i needed to get out to save my life but i didnt know what i would do to support myself your dad paid for me to go to junior college and get a degree so i could be a dental hygienist he paid for the whole thing and nobody else knew about it now i have a job and im making it your dad literally saved my life
5884292 turn our eyes from the temporal the physical and the menial
5884293 but god chose the foolish things of this world to shame the wise god chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong so i can just about guarantee that if we really want to be a part of something great were going to have to be willing to look like fools

5884296 wal mart routinely sends employees home early if a stores sales are not meeting arbitrary projections but the current round of layoffs and hours reductions appear far more widespread than isolated sales problems in individual stores or geographic areas
5884297 but that explanation doesnt wash with employees whose hours are already cut even though the stores are busy
5884298 anyone who works in retail understands the ebb and flow of sales and the maxim that employees treat customers the same way they are treated by the company sam walton knew that but apparently his successors dont
5884299 wal mart claims it is pro associate as it calls its employees but this round of layoffs and cutbacks is only proving to the workers that the so called open door policy is only a buzz word since management refuses to level with its associates about what is happening
5884300 the combination of solid operating performance and improved capital efficiency gave us record earnings this quarter and nearly 5 billion in free cash flow in the first half of fiscal year
5884301 wal mart benefited from its ability to serve shoppers during a difficult economic time

5884806 gmac global relocation services performs consistently well in all of the factors that drive transferee satisfaction and its service philosophy which involves listening to customer needs and committing to agreed upon service levels has been key to its high levels of achievement for two consecutive years
5884807 prudential relocation demonstrates particular strength in the ability of their relocation counselors to address transferee problems in a timely manner across the industry approximately one third of transferees experienced some type of problem during their relocation and the majority of those transferees who experienced a problem contacted their relocation counselor for assistance in resolving it therefore having counselors that are well equipped to handle problems that arise and aid transferees is a great asset
5884808 the relocation process can involve coordinating a myriad of services a task that a transferee may have to take on if a corporate relocation company fails to proactively manage the relocation
5884809 when corporate relocation companies take control in ways that maximize convenience for transferees such as arranging service in an efficient manner and minimizing the number of contacts that a transferee must deal with they considerably improve transferee satisfaction

5884882 russia is a peace loving country both h istorically and recently russia was not in the habit of starting wars at the same time it needs combat ready effective forces that command respect you honoured veterans know that a nation reluctant to provide for an army of its own invites invaders we shall not allow this but we shall not attack others either on the contrary russian international peacekeeping forces including in former republics of the soviet union aim to protect human life and dignity however it is obvious to all that we cannot allow the killers of russian citizens and peacekeepers to go unpunished russia has everything that it needs politically economically and militarily to exact appropriate retribution if there are those who doubt this they should part with such illusions
5884883 ru ssia does not seek tensions on the international scene it only asks due respect for the russian state our people and our values its peacekeepers are only protecting russian citizens and foreign nationals caught in the web of a dangerous situation

5884885 you want to have people over for dinner but history shows that for most of the evening you will probably have your head halfway in the oven or at least over a steaming pot while you listen to the laughter from the other room and wonder what its all about and why isnt anyone bringing you a drink
5884886 its my space my sacred alone peaceful time and nobody can invade it in a world full of chaos pressure unpredictability and constant demands where everybody seems to want a piece of me that hour a day gives me a chance for a quiet perspective and it allows me to control much of my destiny i have found that if i can control my body and give a little peace to my soul i can transfer that power into all other aspects of my life
5884887 this gold medal and world record are a present for my mother
5884888 of course i wanted to do it right at the start with the first attempts that would have been even prettier but with the third it was also alright there was the suspense i want to thank the russian fans for their support there were lots of russian flags come on lena come on i heard and when the height of 5 meters and 5 centimetres was announced everyone was shouting lena we believed you could do it i had goose bumps on my skin im very happy i have 24 world records to my name i would not have been nearly so happy if i had won but without getting a new record

5884896 for every people there is a feast and this is our feast
5884897 allaah has given you better than those feasts the eed al adhaa sacrificing and the eed al fitr
5884898 do not learn the language of the mushriks without a necessity nor enter the churches of mushriks on their festivals because the anger of allaah descends on them
5884899 there is no place in the heart for both sunnah and bidah
5884900 the prophet used not to leave for eed prayer except after eating some dates
5884901 the prophet used to go on the day of eed al fitr and eed al adhaa to the musallah and the first thing he did was to pray
5884902 the prophet prayed two rakaahs for the eed prayer and did not pray before it or after it
5884903 the prophet used to come back from eed al fitr on a path other than the one used in going to it
5884904 it is better that a man is hit with needle on his head than to touch a woman who is not lawful for him

5884925 the understandable reluctance of developing countries to sign up to carbon commitments unless the developed world is prepared to make an equitable contribution calls for more radical options
5884926 in this mix international legal instruments are crucial the existing tools lack the necessary jurisdiction clout and transparency the time is ripe for a serious consideration of an international court for the environment such a court was mooted in washington in 1999 but sank without trace today however we cannot afford to drop the ball
5884927 an enhanced body of law regarding environmental issues and consistency in the resolution of environmental disputes he wrote that such a court should be compulsory and have its own scientific body to assess technical issues
5884928 are lawyers really the best way to save the earth

5884935 a new breed of political observers will be offering volumes of pointed commentary at this years political conventions
5884936 we recognize its a whole new world out there with bloggers but were really embracing it
5884937 its an amazing opportunity for us you dont get all these people in one place but every four years
5884938 the paradox is that the events themselves are all news free and its really mostly just atmospherics theres no real news made after the vp picks are announced
5884939 on the other hand its a target rich environment for bloggers
5884940 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5884941 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5884942 and the ongoing troubles of the new mobileme service see
5884943 we have never seen a gap between the leader and the rest of the pack this big
5884944 they are all windows based and we all know there were some significant problems with vista
5884945 i dont think its possible for apple to have a lead as big as this for long the other companies will retool a bit and come back
5884946 both parts of pope john paul iis pontificate were equally important in the first part in which we saw him as a giant of faith with incredible courage extraordinary force a true joy of faith and great lucidity he took the gospel message to the ends of the earth
5884947 however i must say that because of the humble testimony of his passion to my mind these last years of his pontificate were no less important just as he carried the lords cross before us and put into practice the words of the lord
5884948 who had been a master of words thus showed us visibly it seems to me the profound truth that the lord redeemed us with his cross with the passion as an extreme act of his love
5884949 he showed us that suffering is not only a no something negative the lack of something but a positive reality
5884950 he showed us that suffering accepted for love of christ for love of god and of others is a redeeming force a force of love and no less powerful than the great deeds he accomplished in the first part of his pontificate
5884951 in the first part christ teaches the joy of the kingdom of god brings his gifts to men and then in the second part he is immersed in the passion until his last cry from the cross
5884952 in this very way he taught us who god is that god is love and that in identifying with our suffering as human beings he takes us in his arms and immerses us in his love and this love alone bathes us in redemption purification and rebirth
5884953 that thrives on activism on youth on being young strong and beautiful on succeeding in doing great things
5884954 learn the truth of love which becomes a passion and thereby redeems man and unites him with god who is love
5884955 let us therefore pray for all who are suffering and do our utmost to help them to show our gratitude for their suffering and be present to them as much as we can to the very end
5884956 this is a fundamental message of christianity that stems from the theology of the cross the fact that suffering and passion are present in christs love is the challenge for us to unite ourselves with his passion
5884957 we must love those who suffer not only with words but with all our actions and our commitment i think that only in this way are we truly christian
5884958 faith must continuously face the challenges of thought in this epoch so that it does not seem a sort of irrational legend that we keep alive but that which really is a response to the great questions not merely a habit but the truth
5884959 always be prepared to give reason for the hope that is in you
5884960 wonderful concoction a fruit of our thought and this is why it is universal and for this reason can be communicated to all
5884961 i did once say that to me art and the saints are the greatest apologetic for our faith
5884962 the arguments contributed by reason are unquestionably important and indispensable but then there is always dissent somewhere
5884963 on the other hand if we look at the saints this great luminous trail on which god passed through history we see that there truly is a force of good that resists the millennia likewise if we contemplate the beauties created by faith they are simply i would say the living proof of faith
5884964 it speaks to us itself and on the basis of the cathedrals beauty we succeed in visibly proclaiming god christ and all his mysteries here they have acquired a form and look at us
5884965 are all a luminous sign of god and therefore truly a manifestation an epiphany of god
5884966 i think the great music born in the church makes the truth of our faith audible and perceivable
5884967 in listening to all these works we suddenly understand it is true wherever such things are born the truth is there without an intuition that discovers the true creative center of the world such beauty cannot be born
5884968 when in our epoch we discuss the reasonableness of faith we discuss precisely the fact that reason does not end where experimental discoveries end it does not finish in positivism
5884969 the theory of evolution sees the truth but sees only half the truth it does not see that behind it is the spirit of the creation we are fighting to expand reason and hence for a reason which precisely is also open to the beautiful and does not have to set it aside as something quite different and unreasonable
5884970 i t is the artistic expression of a greatly expanded reason in which heart and reason encounter each other this is the point i believe that in a certain way this is proof of the truth of christianity heart and reason encounter one another beauty and truth converge and the more that we ourselves succeed in living in the beauty of truth the more that faith will be able to return to being creative in our time too and to express itself in a convincing form of art
5884971 few people of our generation have reflected with so much transparency the meek and humble face of jesus christ
5884972 his death wrought by a mentally disturbed woman during a liturgical celebration reminded me of the words of the prophet isaiah about the servant of god mistreated he allowed himself to be humiliated and did not open his mouth he was as a lamb being led to the slaughter as a mute lamb before its shearer
5884973 in a turbulent age for the church and the christian faith brother roger was a source of hope recognized by many including myself
5884974 he was convinced that only an ecumenism nourished by the word of god and the celebration of the eucharist by prayer and contemplation would be able to bring together christians in the unity desired by jesus
5884975 gladly accepting every action that could bring christians of different tradition closer avoiding any word or gesture that might delay their reconciliation
5884976 for me the fact that every year thousands of young people continue to follow the road to the little hill of taiz is truly a gift of the holy spirit for the church today
5884977 i am happy to see that every summer young people from different countries of western and eastern europe belonging to communities of protestant catholic and orthodox tradition pitch their tents in taiz often they are accompanied by their priests or pastors
5884978 how a parable of unity helps to overcome the splits of the past
5884979 i think that many young people realize what is at stake in regard to the unity of christians they know how the weight of divisions makes the witness of christians and the building of a new society difficult
5884980 already from his youth nourished his faith and spiritual life from the sources of other christian traditions thus crossing over certain confessional limits his desire to follow a monastic vocation and with that intention to found a new community with reformed christians says much about this search
5884981 the faith of the prior of taiz was enriched with the patrimony of the faith of the catholic church according to his own testimony referring precisely to the mystery of the catholic faith he understood certain elements of the faith such as the role of the virgin mary in the history of salvation the real presence of christ in the eucharistic gifts and the churchs apostolic ministry in response the catholic church accepted his access to communion
5884982 received communion on many occasions from the hands of john paul ii who had a bond of friendship with him since the time of the second vatican council and who was familiar with his journey in the catholic faith
5884983 in this connection there was nothing secret or concealed in the posture of the catholic church either in taiz or in rome
5884984 reconciling in himself the faith of his origins with the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking communion with anyone
5884985 in his conscience he had entered into the mystery of the catholic faith as one who grows without the need to abandon or break with what he had received or lived before
5884986 out of respect for the journey of faith of the prior of taiz it would be preferable in his case not to apply categories that he considered inappropriate for his experience and that moreover the catholic church never wished to impose on him
5884987 on one hand the prior of taiz felt very close to the bishops of rome in their concern to lead the church of christ on the path of spiritual renewal christian unity service to the poor and witness of the gospel
5884988 profoundly understood and supported by the popes in his personal spiritual journey and in the direction that the young community of taiz was taking
5884989 act in harmony with the thought of the bishop of rome was for him a compass in all his actions
5884990 he would never have implemented an initiative that went against the opinion or will of the pope
5884991 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
5884992 the venerable biblical tradition of sacred scripture known as the old testament displays a series of divine appellations among which is the sacred name of god revealed in a tetragrammaton yhwh hwhw
5884993 the greek translation of the old testament the so called septuagint dating back to the last centuries prior to the christian era had regularly rendered the hebrew tetragrammaton with the greek word kyrios which means lord since the text of the septuagint constituted the bible of the first generation of greek speaking christians in which language all the books of the new testament were also written these christians too from the beginning never pronounced the divine tetragrammaton
5884994 when in fact st paul with regard to the crucifixion writes that god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name
5884995 the attribution of this title to the risen christ corresponds exactly to the proclamation of his divinity
5884996 the title in fact becomes interchangeable between the god of israel and the messiah of the christian faith even though it is not in fact one of the titles used for the messiah of israel
5884997 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
5884998 apart from a motive of a purely philogical order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
5884999 renewed vigor as we seek to build together a society that cares for its own reaches out to the poor and vulnerable and offers true hope to all
5885000 an informed conscience moves beyond personal feelings and individual popularity
5885001 an informed conscience asks first what is right and true an informed conscience examines the candidates and the issues from the perspective of human life and dignity the true good of every human person the true good of society the common good of us all in our nation and in this world
5885002 what can i add to that never forget that human life is the supreme good in this world never forget that human dignity is not an expendable commodity but belongs to everyone without exception
5885003 every day we are pro life every day we are champions of human dignity our voices and our votes should shape society by bringing these inalienable truths into every particular proposal and program every particular candidates projects and plans
5885004 a timely opportunity for catholics to join the pope and return to the bible as the source of parish and personal renewal
5885005 the book series is an opportunity for u s catholics to gain access to the popes personal thoughts and deep spiritual insights
5885006 don alvaros faith embraced faith in god faith in the church faith in the supernatural origin of opus dei and therefore in the divine character of the undertaking god had asked him to take part in
5885007 whom he worked alongside closely for 40 years and later was his first successor as head of opus dei
5885008 it was necessary that she who bore the creator in her womb when he was a baby should live with him in the tabernacles of heaven
5885009 the mother of jesus being in heaven now glorified in body and soul is the image and first fruits of the church which will have its fulfillment in the age to come now shines on the earth as a sign of sure hope and consolation for the people of god pilgrims until the day when the lord will return cf

5885034 we have been over the weekend and we will continue this week
5885035 there is a real need and were trying to fill that need and alleviate the suffering
5885036 surface vessels give us the capability to provide larger amounts of relief supplies because they can obviously carry more and they also give you platform to operate off of they give you aerial assets vertical lift those kind of things
5885037 every open position is an opportunity for airmen to volunteer to meet a critical need of the air force
5885038 we have incredibly talented people looking for new challenges becoming an enlisted aviator is a good match for some of them
5885039 15th reconnaissance squadron personnel have been involved with every major operation in operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom since the inception of combat operations
5885040 every day our people have a direct and lasting impact on combat operations in the aor
5885041 they provide critical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance to ground commanders enable the tracking capture and death of enemy insurgents and provide lifesaving overwatch to coalition forces
5885042 technology today is allowing us to take aviation capabilities to new levels and the predator is a perfect example of how uas support is making a difference in the fight
5885043 the aircrafts armed reconnaissance capabilities provide our ground forces the unblinking eye that can also engage hostile targets either on its own or in combination with manned aircraft like the f 16 fighting falcon if thats not an awesome weapons system i dont know what one is
5885044 the 703rd has been performing heroics fielding more than 165 mq 1s since 1998 multiplying global reach through remote split operations expanding its role to killer by incorporating hellfire missiles surging production to meet an 2009 31 cap requirement and accelerating the original plan of 21 caps by 2010 we broke through 200 000 hours in 2006 300 000 in 2007 and now cruising past 400 000 hours at a clip of about 14 000 hours a month
5885045 this milestone only serves to illustrate the 432nd wings absolute obligation to our ground forces
5885046 four hundred thousand flight hours is a huge number and it takes thousands of men and women here at creech and our air national guard partners at their bases grinding it out to continue to fight over iraq and afghanistan every hour of every day
5885047 it takes great skill to operate the most persistent strike intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platform in the world
5885048 the men and women of the 432nd wing have proved time and again that they are the most qualified for the job which is why the predator remains one of the most sought after assets in the war on terrorism
5885049 while its an honor to be a part of such a historic event this is only one of many more uas milestones to come
5885050 our airmen are flying missions 24 hours a day seven days a week and doing it so well that our combatant commanders are constantly asking for more and theyre getting it
5885051 thanks to our uas airmen there is no telling in the space of 400 000 hours how many servicemembers lives have been saved how many insurgents have been taken out and how many attacks against coalition forces have been stopped before they began
5885052 ive been trying to get on a trip like this for five years

5885141 we will pool our talents and leverage already established friends of the family organizations to launch a grass roots and grass tops effort to register women voters organize a national get out the vote effort around womens issues
5885142 our long term goal is to cultivate and groom women to run for public office at all levels of government including the presidency
5885143 the first order of business for our group is to persuade candidates for the presidency senate and house to incorporate a number of womens rights goals and policies into their platforms
5885144 one womens rights issue conspicuously missing from our list abortion
5885145 its not that the new agenda doesnt view choice as a central womens issue its that roe v wade has been used a single defining issue to hold women voters hostage in the past there are many other issues that are important and relevant to a broad spectrum of women
5885146 although several names were put on a to do list chris matthews was our unanimous choice as the worst offender on womens issues therefore the first person on whom we will focus

5885175 i believe a persons life is pretty much a collection of decisions some small some large but strung together they start to look like one unified thing i learned that you can change the big picture anytime you want it all starts with one decision mine was when i decided that i want to be somebody who brings people hope i want to connect with as many people as possible i want there to be a constant channel of inspiration between me and the people i meet i know in order for this to happen you have to throw yourself out there and allow yourself to be vulnerable

5885200 some hindus in india are actually pressuring the government there to reinstate an ancient requirement of hinduism called suttee a belief that a hindu widow must be burned alive on or beside the pyre on which her husbands body is cremated it matters not if she is a mother with dependent children or dacades younger than her husband if she outlives her spouse she disgraces him herself and his and her families both suttee was abolished under british colonial control around the end of the eighteenth century as soon as india became independent in 1947 some hindus not all began clamoring for suttee to be reinstated thus far the government of india has resisted their pressure

5885217 are not in good condition and are continuing steadily on a long term decline
5885218 coral reefs around the world are confronted by the same types of threats in some places it is worse in some places its slightly better but were finding that even remote reefs are showing signs of decline
5885219 it really stresses out the coral and makes them more susceptible to things like disease
5885220 if the ocean continues to acidify its possible that it would preclude corals from growing because they wont be able to draw the nutrients and elements out of the water that they need to create the structures that they produce as coral colonies
5885221 its also possible that ocean acidification may become so extreme that it may begin to dissolve the corals that already exist which would spell disaster for coastal communities
5885222 coral reefs only cover about one percent of the worlds surface but they are a very diverse and important environment or ecosystem
5885223 they provide us fisheries they provide us culture from the cultural resources they provide us pharmaceuticals and they provide us protection from storm events
5885224 that biodiversity is holding the key to treatment of diseases current and future
5885225 as we disturb that biodiversity and reduce the species richness we change that equation dramatically
5885226 the declining conditions that were seeing is exacerbated by having a number of threats work together to cause the decline
5885227 i think if we dont change the way were going with these reef ecosystems we cant expect them to get better
5885228 so were going to have to make some hard choices society wise political wise economic wise to protect these ecosystems

5885316 we have breaking news today the worlds leading scientists have recently told of a global epidemic soon to begin in the lighter parts of this week
5885317 what scientists believe to be happening is that the sun is turning into a black hole for some of you that do not know it is the death of stars over 20 times as big as the sun these stellar monsters do not stop collapsing even when they become neutron stars there is no force in the universe strong enough to stop them when they implode they bend the very fabric of space and time and form the most mysterious phenomenon in the whole cosmos
5885318 we need to finish what we started i will finish it
5885319 what we do know is that sometime around last week mercury was pulled into the sun along with venus are leading scientists told us that something went horribly wrong with the gravitational field before the planets went in we only know that the sun pulsed radiation and hypersonic waves into deep space those waves pushed our planet away from the sun until we were in the place of the once known planet neptune out of the suns way the sun exploded into a supernova that would be when a massive shock wave radiates throughout the whole star which heats up to around 1 billion c then it explodes as a supernova this flash is as bright as a whole galaxy and leaves behind a rapidly spinning neutron star with all this going on some left on the streets looking out into the abyss when the bright light happened it left many beings blind said to be brighter than 2600 flashlights into your eyes
5885320 although it blinded a few thousand people this was the least of our worries day was slowly becoming the evening all was the same plants died it became cold no matter where you were and people seemed to be turning psychotic
5885321 at any rate scientists have recently released information on what will possibly happen

5885533 tom hearn really embodied what is best about wake forest he was so committed to its purposes and its people
5885534 we separated so that wake forest would be a private university with religious roots but not a denominational university and that was important i think in carrying out the mission of wake forest as a true university
5885535 hearn recognized that wake forest as an academic institution could play an integral role in that transformation
5885536 a very soft spoken individual but when he spoke he spoke with authority and i think people respected that

5885555 the security of our ports is critical to the australian economy
5885556 dsto is using sophisticated visualisation software representing sydney harbour port botany and the port of brisbane to scan for security weaknesses and improve situational awareness
5885557 this maritime security research program builds on dstos world class capability in maritime operations analysis mine warfare and coastal warfare systems
5885558 the government is keen to ensure that dsto facilities are fully geared to meet the operational needs of defence with access to modern technology and leading edge capabilities
5885559 for 100 years now our defence scientists have proven they can deliver innovative technology solutions for the adf including some world leading developments in science
5885560 the australia us alliance is one of the three pillars of labors foreign policy along with our engagement with the united nations and our commitment to engagement with our own region
5885561 the us has a vital role to play in the provision of global peace security and prosperity for australia the continued presence of the united states in our region is vital to strategic stability in the asia pacific both now and for the future
5885562 i was recently in the united states to inspect some of the major procurement projects of interest to the adf namely the wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and the joint strike fighter programs
5885563 i also had the pleasure earlier this year of announcing the activation for australia of the wideband global satellite communications network the direct result of a partnership between australia and the united states
5885564 i am also monitoring the progress of the defence trade cooperation treaty between australian and the united states this treaty once ratified will allow both countries to improve the ease of transfer of technology
5885565 as well as researching ways to make these power stations cleaner we also need to look at ways to locally generate energy closer to the users and better control that energy use
5885566 currently 80 per cent of energy consumed in australia is generated from large centralised carbon intensive coal based power stations as well as researching ways to make these power stations cleaner we also need to look at ways to locally generate energy closer to the users and better control that energy use
5885567 by combining the expertise of csiro and these five universities through the intelligent grid cluster we will be able to help find solutions to australias complex energy challenges
5885568 through nine separate research projects the intelligent grid cluster will model the market benefits of large scale deployment of distributed energy in the national electricity market and fully value the economic contribution of the intelligent grid compared to conventional energy technologies

5885572 its designed to help our members save money at the gas pump and reduce their financing costs
5885573 were lending more on the loans on these vehicles to help our members facilitate that transaction
5885574 so it means they dont have to come up with as much money out of pocket to get out of a car into another car
5885575 theyre borrowing 35 percent more than the car is worth so if theyre currently upside down in the vehicle theyve got more than likely theyre going to be upside down in the new vehicle also
5885576 that can be 20 a month 15 20 a month
5885577 the 7 5 percent loan your payment is 8 less a month thats all
5885578 its about 137 a year in interest savings so to some people thats a lot of money for others its not worth it
5885579 say ok this is the difference in the mortgage payments and the interest payments over say five or six years
5885580 but you also have to look more importantly at whats going to be the savings in fuel over say five to six years and its not always going to be as great as you think
5885581 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5885582 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5885583 were obviously focusing on aspects that have to do with strategic or military situation but we will of course review everything
5885584 these planes are being customized as per our requirement if we get some buyer we may sell them and if not then we can use them with one stop to us or go in for nonstop flights once fuel prices fall to make such flights viable

5885613 dsto is one of the largest employers of scientists in australia and is particularly reliant on highly qualified science graduates to undertake research in support of defence
5885614 while the demand for science qualified staff is growing the numbers of students studying science is falling the shortage of science skills is not good for defence or for the australian economy
5885615 and just as in the army navy and air force we need to broaden our recruitment pool to meet our current and future commitments dsto must also learn to appeal to the full scope of potential scientists and be more representative of the australian community
5885616 i believe the defence science cadetship initiative will go a long way towards motivating indigenous students to take up science as a career
5885617 this landmark agreement will provide h i fraser with 88 additional training opportunities over and above the companys normal training program
5885618 the agreement represents a joint commitment on the part of the defence materiel organisation dmo and h i fraser to spend over 2
5885619 the australian owned hi fraser specialises in gas fluid and waste engineering providing specialist hyperbaric engineering and technical support for sustainment of the royal australian navy fleet
5885620 under the sadi scheme the australian government provides financial support for the direct costs of training which in this instance accounts for around thirty percent of the total commitment
5885621 i would like to congratulate the staff at dmo for all of their hard work on the sadi program and for achieving the 50
5885622 the sadi initiative shares the responsibility for skills growth and development between industry and government given the importance of this industry to our national security the government is strongly committed to supporting defence industry with a meaningful response to the specific training needs of the defence sector
5885623 unfortunately the rust has been ineffective in the tropical north so we started investigating the possible introduction of additional strains better adapted to the tropics that would enhance biocontrol in those areas
5885624 thats when the weed threw the team a curve ball
5885625 none of the extra strains would infect australian noogoora burr australian rust strains on the other hand produced severe symptoms so we couldnt establish cultures of these exotic strains and perform the host specificity tests necessary before approval for release could be given plants developed typical resistance reactions when inoculated with the imported strains thats when the detective work began back where the rust strains came from the dominican republic and mexico
5885626 its more complicated than we first thought but we now know the system better and have laid the groundwork for future success
5885627 in future we hope to find out where australian noogoora burr originally came from and look there for pathogenic rust strains if this cant be achieved we will consider establishing an outdoor garden of australian noogoora burr in tropical america to attract suitable rust strains
5885628 its more complicated than we first thought but we now know the system better and have laid the groundwork for future success

5885632 the feature of the slave south that puzzled and disappointed the more idealistic yankees was the diligence with which so many of the slaves they encountered protected and sustained their masters plantations
5885633 higher percentage of blacks than whites had been born in america
5885634 in fact only one percent were african born no group except native americans had deeper north american roots

5885657 we expect continued supply issues but the situation is definitely getting better
5885658 its a hard game for them to play trying to predict how many phones they are going to sell and ultimately they are going to say its a good problem for them but we say it would be better not to have that problem at all
5885659 we have been quickly selling all the supplies we get
5885660 they have been using best buy pretty extensively with the macintosh
5885661 and the fact that they are going forward with that signals that they are pretty confident that the supply is going to be adequate
5885662 they have a much more complex supply chain than they had in the past
5885663 they are just having trouble figuring out where to put those things
5885664 success in rowing sailing and track cycling can essentially be bought by siphoning off money from the public purse and handing it to the athletes who are then able to train like professionals success in sport like in the agricultural market is easier when it receives huge state subsidies

5885666 this just wasnt a elimination of a threat to iraq this was elimination of a threat to a west part of this titanic struggle we are in between western judeo christian values amp principles amp islamic extremists
5885667 a number one issue people should make in a selection of a president of a united states is will this person carry on in a judeo christian principled tradition that has made this nation a greatest experiment in a history of mankind

5885669 we try to pull out all the summer reading lists and make that available to them we go ahead and start coordinating fall programs sat prep programs
5885670 its not just time for kids to go back to school but the whole town goes back to school
5885671 you want to start early you dont want to wait until the first day of school to begin
5885672 i hope they realize that this is hurting students and some parents are refusing to pay the money
5885673 in the budget process we have to look for additional revenues and we have to look for reduction in revenue in our budget and this was one way of looking for increased revenue
5885674 the effect is an increased dependence on the bus system which in turn adds to the fuel fund deficit
5885675 a number of people have spoken to me raising concerns about traffic safety on country roads should b triples be allowed
5885676 many issues need to be addressed such as increasing the number of overtaking lanes and extending their length to at least 1 8 kilometres which is the preferred length
5885677 there also needs to be a boost in the number of high quality truck stops these are vital to alleviate driver fatigue
5885678 there are about 1400 heavy vehicle movements in horsham a day and this number is increasing with more using the western highway
5885679 truck accidents are of concern on sections of this highway
5885680 it was a massive event and there was no trouble
5885681 they took two weeks off work to get over here we had people from tasmania we sold seven tickets to queenslanders and one person came from darwin
5885682 we wont know exactly how much was raised until next week when all the bills come in but id expect it to be in the vicinity of 20 000 to 30 000
5885683 some of the money will go to longerenong college scholarships and some will go to the community
5885684 wed also like to thank dooen hotel heinrich merchandise ra transport 3wm and the mail times for their support
5885685 i say a deep and genuine thank you to state and federal governments for their continued support to have this rolled over
5885686 weve been advocating for the extension and weve been advocating for a quick announcement
5885687 we are pleased that it has been rolled over for six months and we are pleased it has been an early announcement
5885688 its disappointing for east gippsland but its good news for the other areas
5885689 i like the rest of you and 99 per cent of the community are indeed extremely disappointed that green lake was not on the list of lakes that could be used
5885690 we need 2000 to 3000 megalitres so the community can enjoy the recreation facilities at green lake
5885691 over a long time the community has enjoyed the benefits of the facilities its very friendly to families and young people its the heart and soul of our very special community
5885692 gwmwater is suggesting the community get involved and develop the facilities at taylors lake the community has already done that at green lake why should we do it again
5885693 maybe the board and management at gwmwater should spend the next five years volunteering at taylors lake to develop it
5885694 green lake is so important to this community its a shame to think this system needs so little water to operate yet there seems to be so little water available
5885695 its going to get water in a wet year anyway
5885696 it makes good sense to make green lake our premier boating and recreation lake taylors lakes banks are not suited to it i dont want to take my family out there and sit on rocks taylors lake and pine lake already have beaches
5885697 we have never said we wanted their water we believe its very important that water go down the river and they greatly need water for their community
5885698 that is the kind of money we will need to bring taylors lake up to scratch if not more
5885699 nearly all our members are going on strike everyone sees it as the only alternative now
5885700 the point of this is to embarrass the brumby government about not supporting public education
5885701 our primary reason is to receive a pay rise and reach parity with schools in terms of pay
5885702 the government is offering us a three and a quarter per cent rise which is below inflation
5885703 were seeking parity with schools at the moment school teachers are paid up to 13 000 more than tafe teachers class sizes are also a real concern because pay is so bad we cant attract staff to work in tafe and that causes problems with class sizes we often have to double up and run bigger groups
5885704 i think theres a lot of support across the university for any action that will bring about a change to our current situation
5885705 we were a little disappointed the council didnt move to start a rehousing program straight away but thats been referred to the advisory committee so that could be another really good outcome
5885706 is it economical well its less than 4000 i wouldnt have thought that was overly oppressive to the budget
5885707 the reality is we have no choice we have to adopt the department of primary industries recommendation
5885708 it comes down to where this community and this council sits on things
5885709 we see ourselves as a regional centre and i think we need to act like one
5885710 im amazed people cant see the forest for the trees
5885711 we do it humanely no one can say were doing it wrong
5885712 people who want to get their pet euthanised by injection have that right
5885713 i personally dont like crimes against a person or any victim based crime where people have been broken into or peoples property has been damaged
5885714 having been a police officer for a long time and a person who has been burgled twice i know the effects
5885715 the increase in drug arrests demonstrates a significant amount of work by our members and the single year clearance rate for drug offences is at a high of 97 2 and 99 5 per cent respectively
5885716 the recent drug seizure in horsham was the result of the polices hard work and the use of information from the public
5885717 police have taken swift and affirmative action to all reported sex non rape offences
5885718 we have had a single year clearance rate of 91 6 per cent which means there is a very high chance of being caught and dealt with
5885719 we have the highest clean up rate in the region and one of the highest in the state which is outstanding
5885720 we really need the assistance of the public especially in cases of thefts and burglary
5885721 we target our operations and resources on the intelligence weve received
5885722 we recommend it for their safety and to ensure the closest unit will be contacted to attend
5885723 triple 0 is our communications centre they will know if there is another unit travelling through or another unit close by
5885724 i think it is important to march in memory of mates who didnt make it back its not to glorify war
5885725 he would have made a major contribution to society if he had not been killed in vietnam
5885726 i heard about jims death while i was at sea in the far east
5885727 its very important to remember those who never came home and to remember those who have suffered since
5885728 defence has now received over 3 million in royalties for the worldwide sale of the australian minesweeping system while a significant number of jobs have been created for australian workers
5885729 this is a genuine collaboration in which dsto and industry have shared the risks and the rewards it has enhanced defence capability produced revenue for industry and the commonwealth and reinforced

5885734 i know anything that involves the thp is juicy fodder

5885740 australian special forces observed the airstrike which struck the taliban extremist group killing mullah akhtar mohammed
5885741 the sotg troops extracted from the area without further incident following the operation
5885742 mullah akhtar mohammed was a senior taliban extremist commander within oruzgan province who controlled a large force of insurgents and directed a strong campaign of intimidation and violence within his area of responsibility
5885743 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5885744 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatants afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf airstrike
5885745 this decision cannot stand and we will evaluate our options to seek review from the u s supreme court
5885746 this decision may have a big impact on californias proposition 8 the initiative to protect traditional marriage as voters begin to recognize the radical agenda of our opposition
5885747 the doctors are disheartened by the decision and what it will mean for physicians in the future however the california supreme court made it clear that the doctors will have their day in court to tell their story to a jury of their peers despite plaintiffs argument the doctors will not be silenced
5885748 our clients will have the right to defend against the plaintiffs claims by testifying to the ethical and religious reasons for dr brodys decision
5885749 dr brody was very clear that she would not perform the iui on any unmarried women
5885750 has aroused the ire of musicians and not all of them classical traditionalists damon albarn lead singer of blur and co creator of gorillaz argues that schoolchildren should be forced to learn staff notation
5885751 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation if you think its about giving children some understanding of a wide range of musical traditions then teachers should have the flexibility to talk about other ways in which music is transmitted
5885752 at this stage docs cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin and were not just playing in the vicinity
5885753 at first we thought the kids were just playing in the bin but they are there during the day with no adult and you just wonder why they are dressed the way they are and why they are not at school
5885754 the child jumped up and both of them were shocked
5885755 was unable to provide assurances that shed be able to protect the child in the future
5885756 everythings fine he had a triple bypass and hes fine

5885762 sometimes you are going to get burned thats what happens
5885763 99 percent of what we do here is wonderful and only a little is not
5885764 i dont believe well be more than 90 million over in the end i do not think it will be delayed
5885765 im afraid that with the price of steel and all the things that go into construction the bids will blow by that
5885766 if it gets to a point where we cant afford it weve simply got to pull the plug on it
5885767 if the bids come in and are way over it does not appear to me we can go forward
5885768 i cant answer why he rendell said what he said at the end of the day there will be a convention center expansion there will be casinos built theres too much invested for this not to happen
5885769 i dont know why the governor said what he said it will be a tremendous benefit to the city the region and the state it is my expectation that the project will move forward the building will get built and we will have a spectacular convention center expansion
5885770 everything is much more expensive than it used to be steel is noticeably in the forefront of that
5885771 a lot of owners both public and private are rethinking their projects
5885772 part of it is the chinese buying so much part of it is a slowdown of the auto manufacturers not producing as much scrap
5885773 we couldnt get much more than 790 million from the state and the city combined thats no 1 where can we find the money
5885774 my job is to get this thing done and we are going to get it done
5885775 mayor nutter is 1 000 percent for it hes not going to let this fall through the cracks not when you are looking a gift horse in the mouth of 700 million

5885789 dass es hier passiert ist ist nat rlich bitter das ist schicksal
5885790 es ist eine schande denn satchmo war in gro artiger form aber so ist das leben bis dahin war es seine bisher beste k r
5885791 ich bin gro es risiko gegangen und wurde daf r nicht belohnt
5885792 schade es war bis auf den patzer die beste k r auf satchmo aber nach so einem fehler ist das nat rlich schon sehr entt uschend
5885793 vielleicht hat er sich an den ersten fehler erinnert das pferd ist eben so genial da passiert so was schon mal
5885794 ich kann es mir nicht erkl ren dass es wieder zu dem fehler kam
5885795 so sehr wie hier stand fabian noch nie unter druck deswegen geht das ergebnis in ordnung
5885796 es ist eine dumme einstellung wenn es nur um die goldmedaille geht
5885797 aber wenn jeder irgendwie von diesem verdammten gold redet drehst du irgendwann am rad
5885798 nach dem adler war gar nichts mehr im kopf da habe ich die automatik eingeschaltet und nur zu ende geturnt
5885799 wenn hier alles normal gelaufen w re h tte es gereicht aber es war nicht meine woche es waren nicht meine spiele
5885800 ihm muss hoch angerechnet werden dass er nach dem fehler den karren nicht hingeworfen hat

5885808 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
5885809 governo estabelecer prioridades n o poss vel as pessoas serem maltratadas por falta de atendimento b sico
5885810 est se tornando mais e mais o criminoso neste conflito
5885811 eles pretendiam e provavelmente ainda pretendem estrangular a ge rgia e sua economia
5885812 bom isso o que eles t m feito cruel destrui o da infra estrutura civil informes de uso de muni es que jamais deveriam ser usadas contra civis o ass dio nas auto estradas contra viajantes leg timos o fechamento do porto de poti que agora come a a afetar estados vizinhos

5885820 yes of course st fama and st french say so
5885821 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5885822 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5885823 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5885824 hes quoted as saying i never lost a game i just ran out of time
5885825 and my impression of the 2004 election was exactly that that david soares was elected not because he won the election but because we ran out of time in presenting our case to the public
5885826 soares campaign rebuts saying quote we won because the voters of albany county supported soares aggressive reform agenda
5885827 hes made the office of the albany county district attorney a laughing stock in the state and in the country
5885828 thats where it started and it ended as recently as two weeks ago with the comptrollers report of the mishandling of 300 000 in the office of the district attorney
5885829 while he was out chasing ball players down for steroid violations we were having shootings and gun problems here in the streets of albany
5885830 he took governor spitzers word for something and took the employee and assistants of governor spitzers word for things and then white washed it
5885831 a grand jury can indict it can also report and that would have put the thing to rest
5885832 the city has constructed basketball courts in places where kids can go and play basketball safely and not disturb the neighbors
5885833 i respect mr mirch i think it was a big misunderstanding about taking the goal and about pointing fingers but that is not our call to this neighborhood
5885834 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5885835 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5885836 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5885837 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5885838 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation

5885870 the construction company is getting almost 2 million to supervise this project
5885871 the ohio school facilities said you have to have a construction management company
5885872 the companys major concern is the legal ramifications to make sure they get the job and then make sure they have an attorney for every loophole that there is it isnt about whats right for kids they dont care about the kids they just care about getting the money
5885873 the flaw is that these people are being given these bids by the ohio school facilities commission osfcs fear is that they are going to be sued and theyre not going to be politically correct in awarding contracts and the kids and the school boards are at the mercy of these attorneys its that way all over the state
5885874 i look around and it looks to me like theres a skeleton staff here as opposed to a full force effort by all the people involved to get things done i dont know how in the world theyre going to be able to start school on the 27th its frustrating
5885875 were going to be spending just under 7 billion in the next three years in additional school facilities construction throughout the state
5885876 if they osfc have got problems with an operation like this kccc how in the world are they going to ensure that the money they are spending for school facilities is going to provide quality schools and if it doesnt in a short period of time were going to end up with dilapidated buildings and no money we cant allow that to happen and were not going to allow that to happen

5885938 t he basic prediction of warming is founded on very fundamental physical principles relating to infrared absorption by greenhouse gases theory of blackbody radiation and atmospheric moist thermodynamics all these individual elements have been verified to high accuracy in laboratory experiments and field observations for a time there was some remaining uncertainty about whether water vapor feedback would amplify warming in the way hypothesized in the early energy balance models but a decade or two of additional observational and theoretical work has shown that there is no real reason to doubt the way in which general circulation models calculate the feedback when modified by inclusion of the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols the theory gives a satisfactory account of the pattern of 20th and 21st century temperature change

5885946 re 103 a deliberate world wide effort to stall ghg abatements until someone learns to crack hydrogen from a crude oil molecule err dont we know how to do that now and what would be the point youd still have the carbon sitting around either emitted as co2 during the cracking reaction or as solid carbon which im sure someone would ship off to the nearest coal fired power plant

5885952 but even if we had enough values of the cycle lengths for a reliable statistical analysis there is another difficulty that is inherent with the lengths they are measured from a cycle minimum to the next minimum but the definition of a cycle minimum is not based on any theory the next jovian perihelion is in late march in 2011 i predict that the length of the cycle 23 is in the range of 12 2 13 years this means a minimum earliest in october 2008 and latest in july 2009 i use the minimum of 1996 6 this means that the cycle 24 is very low in the range of 40 70 or a dalton level this means that the maximum will be reached only in 2014

5885982 executive search has become a real need because bpo businesses have excellent opportunities for expansion both locally and globally
5885983 although these companies have their own in house recruitment teams increasing client demand for services expansion has put additional operations pressure on these teams thats one reason they are outsourcing the strategic task of top level executive search
5885984 most bpos have very young recruitment teams and they are focused on large ramp ups for agent level positions this is important to assure continuous operations in their customer and technical services departments
5885985 this is where executive search fits in its an inefficient use of resources for in house recruitment teams to engage in senior executive search because this is not what they are set up to do
5885986 when we started out with our executive search services we were only servicing five companies
5885987 just a year later 30 clients have engaged our executive search services
5885988 we can safely say that industry wide our bpo clients have a sizable 50 share and the remaining 50 of our clients are distributed among the manufacturing electronics pharmaceutical and finance industries

5886116 the groups research has paved the way for the development of a versatile light weight low cost high speed and high performance hyperspectral imaging system
5886117 the overall approach to systems design has overcome the problem of processing large amounts of data and they have also achieved miniaturisation essentially producing a spectrometer on a chip
5886118 the universitys innovative work could have many far reaching consequences in the defence domain
5886119 they include improved threat and target identification at longer ranges in hazardous urban environments and for the protection of ships aircraft and vehicles

5886121 a 23 year old mans attempt to show his girlfriend a pistol ended in tragedy when the gun discharged killing her jefferson parish sheriffs deputies said
5886122 you know what they say a bat in the hand is worth two in the belfry
5886123 both research and the hands on experience of state highway safety agencies indicate that this law has saved countless lives underage drinking remains a serious problem that needs to be addressed but lowering the drinking age would be a gigantic step backward for highway safety
5886124 we know from previous experience that when the drinking age was lower in the 1970s that deaths among 18 to 20 year olds in traffic fatalities went up by about 800 a year
5886125 we also know that when the age was raised in the 1980s the opposite occurred deaths went down
5886126 it would be a national tragedy to turn back the clock and jeopardize the lives of more teens
5886127 would be the dumbest thing in the world that we could do
5886128 were estimating that the reduced drinking age has saves 900 lives a year and 25 000 since weve begun collecting data on fatalities
5886129 we think that the minimum drinking age law has been incredibly effective at saving lives and we think it should stay just where it is
5886130 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
5886131 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
5886132 for a long time some college presidents have felt that the drinking age provides them with a problem
5886133 it makes them card students it makes them prevent students from making their own choices its a nuisance for college presidents it is difficult for them to deal with this problem so they are giving up and they are finding reasons to give up by saying the drinking age is causing the problem
5886134 there has been a drop in drinking among younger people
5886135 but when they get to college the conditions at college really serve to be catalysts for increasing the drinking presidents should talk about what it is at college that contributes to this problem
5886136 had this trademark been allowed it would have given dell a monopoly over a term clearly in descriptive use what is surprising however is how long it has taken for this application to be rejected
5886137 googles programs are frequently described in this manner if dell wishes to protect its particular cloud computing solution it needs to give it a distinctive brand name and trademark instead
5886138 it could brand its solutions to make clear they are based on cloud computing technology without laying claim to the process itself

5886143 in the past 12 18 months lexmark has been through a lot of re structuring and consolidation which has had an impact on the companys performance
5886144 despite the economic doom and gloom of the past year as other industries fell victim to job cuts and declining profits it remained resilient
5886145 it has been one of the last fields to be affected this time meaning it will be one of the first areas to pick up again when the economy revives no sector is immune from economic fluctuation but any downturn in it is only likely to be temporary because it companies simply cannot survive without it
5886146 i would expect to see the existing metering and systems firms fleshing out their portfolios through acquisitions so that they can offer a full solution to energy suppliers

5886148 the first time that i saw your face on a cold december night it was a tuesday on a gig with a band that we both liked
5886149 32 measures of the same loop doesnt usually hold my interest
5886150 we dont like feeling stuck to a genre or a constricting definition of what we are we like to play with our creativity and let whatever comes out come out
5886151 shes constantly coming up with ideas and im utterly inspired by her we carry around little tape recorders and capture snippets of ideas as they come along and later patch them together into songs thats how it usually works
5886152 there were different opinions in the company about which direction we should go with our music because we had so many different ways we liked to play
5886153 in the end we often got to do what we wanted with some compromises here and there
5886154 being strongly independent and having a vision for our project has been very good for us
5886155 its allowed us to guide the direction of our music and visual content and given us a lot of freedom now that weve started our own little label the green witch society both girls are dedicated environmentalists we can do any project we put our minds to and its up to us to follow through with it were learning a lot as we go
5886156 we slowed down and got to meet a lot of great people and enjoy the wind and the trees and the rocks and the seas
5886157 i realised how huge the us is its full of so many beautiful types of terrain and there are so many people with different ideas all within the same country
5886158 many people are afraid to ride bikes here because cars rule the place
5886159 on the bike tour we rode through many large cities that were much better set up for bicycle commuters and we were so inspired to see how well bikes can be incorporated into the transportation system if given some attention
5886160 shes amazing the first time i heard her on the radio i was so excited that something that good was being created in my lifetime shes got a great record out called kismet
5886161 typically a breakdown of energy usage does not exist so an it manager does not understand how energy is used
5886162 the imarsat 4s are the worlds most sophisticated commercial network for mobile voice and data services and the successful launch of the third 1 4 allows us to complete the global coverage for our broadband services
5886163 this orbit allows inmarsat to provide global broadband coverage with just three satellites
5886164 despite the economic doom and gloom of the past year the it sector has been pretty robust
5886165 while other industries fell victim to job cuts and declining profits it remained resilient the results of our survey show it is only now that we are feeling the effects of the credit crunch
5886166 it is at the very heart of businesses companies simply cannot survive without it and this survey demonstrates that it professionals understand this point
5886167 unlike during the last recession which was linked to the dotcom boom and bust this time it is one of the last fields to be affected by the credit crunch
5886168 these figures should act as a wake up call to anyone employing it professionals
5886169 people management has not been an area of focus for many in the industry but the possibility of unhappy employees willing to leave their employer at the drop of a hat should help to highlight the issue
5886170 it reflects a significant increase in business for us within london where demand for capacity and power is outstripping availability
5886171 with this in mind operational sustainability was at the forefront during the design and build
5886172 however a datacentre will perform equally well at a higher temperature and in doing so datacentre owners will see a significant reduction in their energy bill
5886173 it is the simplest steps that make the biggest difference
5886174 my familys always been involved and abreast of whats going on in the country and with politics
5886175 were getting very positive feedback from people and coming up to christmas we expect it to really increase
5886176 they havent had that to sell before theyre going to make recurring revenue out of that with every pc theyll make a living even without any service calls

5886180 because were all lairy and lost and this is such a pointless cost
5886181 dont collect them all and dont ask for a specific one they will be sent out according to a random number generator by our blindfolded mail order crew
5886182 this could be a very stupid idea and completely fall on its arse
5886183 at least all of the internet will be there to see it happen
5886184 a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with warm devonshire cream you feel like a paper bag filled with curtain rods
5886185 summertime is here cant you see light through those branches
5886186 i just want to have a good time with my friends everyone gets drunk and parties hard
5886187 great forum to get new ideas out there and maybe come up with a better solution than we have now
5886188 even if nothing came of it i certainly dont think anything bad could come of having an open discussion
5886189 it saves about a thousand lives a year were happy to have a further dialogue and have engaged on the whole subject of underage drinking because its still too high and it needs to come down but that law needs to stay to save lives
5886190 maybe not all the way to 18 but i think probably a 20 year old or 19 year old could handle it
5886191 i dont feel an 18 year old or 19 or 20 necessarily is responsible enough to drink
5886192 torre m 30 se levanta junto al donde el tr nsito vehicular seg n la definici n de junquera
5886193 we have certainly been affected by illegal narcotics weve been affected by gang activity
5886194 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5886195 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5886196 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5886197 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5886198 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5886199 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5886200 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5886201 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
5886202 it means the world to me to retain the armband
5886203 it was a little bit of a surprise because of the form rio has shown for manchester united and what they have achieved over the last couple of seasons
5886204 i was standing next to rio when the coach announced it and he turned to me and shook my hand that shows the quality of the man
5886205 i think i showed to the manager what kind of captain i am at the end of last season he gave me a boost by giving me the armband against the united states when i scored and i am now delighted to have the chance of captaining a winning england team
5886206 johns big personality is why i chose him but rio is also important for the team which is why i made him vice captain
5886207 but the captain needs a big personality on and off the pitch and in the dressing room
5886208 i want to see england playing with spirit and without fear tomorrow and with a big personality as a team it is a very important match for us the last before the qualifiers start and i want us to take another step forward
5886209 what about jack reed of rhode island a friend there says the town is crawling with secret service and government plates i dont know any better but to trust him
5886210 i know hes a short little brick house and a good wrestler but ill have a lot or reach on him and i dont think anybodys wrestling compares to mine
5886211 people underestimate my wrestling joe riggs did and got thrown because of that im going to do the same thing to terry if he wants to wrestle with me
5886212 dennis runs practice almost like a wrestling practice and ive been a wrestler since elementary school so i learned the same way he teaches
5886213 when i was in the hospital recovering i was around people who were shot in the same places as me but who couldnt walk or who lost their limbs as a result of what happened
5886214 some of them even passed away that really made me think twice and start hanging out in a different environment
5886215 fighting has always been a part of me i come from a fightin family
5886216 you have to be aggressive to make it in mma im aggressive and agile and i think i have a very entertaining style
5886217 i think that ed is a pretty good striker with good hand speed but i think his ground game is questionable and im confident that i can neutralize it
5886218 as more schools enter the bsf programme expenditure will rise steeply
5886219 partnerships for schools the organisation responsible for bsf has predicted that 35 schools will open between 2008 09 115 in 2009 10 165 in 2010 11 and 200 each year afterwards until the completion of the modernisation programme
5886220 local authorities are seeing it as extremely important for their transformation
5886221 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5886222 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5886223 if ca has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise
5886224 they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5886225 our information is specific to being an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5886226 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence
5886227 the ideal situation would be for the icc to move the event because from an aca perspective our players wont be going to pakistan and they want to play in the champions trophy
5886228 sri lanka has its own set of concerns for us
5886229 the primary concern is that we have a well established process for assessing the security situation wherever we go theres 20 days between now and the start of the event does that give us enough time to assess the situation in sri lanka
5886230 we have nominated as the back up venue we can hold all the games in colombo or if they want to go out we can go out
5886231 we already have india here playing in one day and test series we have just hosted the saarc south asian association for regional cooperation meeting i cant see how sri lanka is unsafe
5886232 the rains in july and august dispelled earlier concerns about hot weather in june
5886233 i view the time now in the cranberry industry as one of change and opportunity
5886234 i think thats really what the industry needed a really good crop
5886235 as long as the equation is in our favor i think the price will remain the same
5886236 yes son i am dead now and i will never find rest until my death is avenged
5886237 you will enlist in the school of magic and become a servant to lord xanith when the timing is right you must put an end to him do you understand
5886238 yes i am afraid he is but he came back to give me a command
5886239 father commanded me to serve his killer the lord xanith i am to serve him and kill him
5886240 with father gone i am free to join the church he never let me in the past
5886241 would you like to join me in the church sister

5886247 we want to know why youre crying such a pretty lady should not be filled with sorrow what could be so wrong it sent you running through the woods and who knows rumors of a thieving group that steals from lonely travelers sometimes they wouldnt even leave there victims alive
5886248 im not afraid of anything i would join them if i could
5886249 that might be possible maybe you hadnt noticed but we are the thieves we just mentioned we would love to add a woman to our number what you say
5886250 he took a pass around rashina and looked her up and down
5886251 i like it from now on i am claw and i will be known as claw to all those that have harmed me and to those who will harm me in the future
5886252 now claw you didnt answer our question why are you crying
5886253 well i guess i can tell you i was cleaning the church and decided to steal from the tithe my sister caught me and got me in trouble with the head monk that is when i started to run
5886254 the church isnt too far off how much do you think the church has
5886255 perfect lets go to the church and help ourselves to some holy money
5886256 rashina what are you doing here youre with the thieves stealing our tithe again
5886257 but im so hungry cant you have sympathy on me
5886258 i belong to no guild i belong to no man or woman i am a renegade
5886259 i beg to differ you are the one who wont get out alive she drew her blade and readied it
5886260 i kill who i want i take what i want i do what i want understand
5886261 maam renegade lady i have troubled news the church has sent out a band of men to search for us they intend to slay us and place our heads on display and the charr are making raids of their own now this is our territory not theirs
5886262 last summer i really had to take a break and see what i should do see if it was time for me to stop
5886263 i was not feeling huge motivation to keep going but i came up with the fact that i didnt want to end the way i was feeling last year
5886264 i wanted to find some more emotions on the court and maybe try to do a few more things in the big ones i want to keep going
5886265 i am really happy and feeling that i am adjusting pretty well so far
5886266 even though its been a pretty tough year because a lot of injuries came up i think i can keep going a little more
5886267 i thought maria sharapova played a pretty good first few months but got injured
5886268 these stories and the accompanying pages for a novel in progress are exhilarating unflinching in their portrait of a country and people in torment yet full of spirit humour and humanity

5886274 the consumer lending market has moved beyond recognition lending markets are currently beset by high market uncertainties with the ongoing credit crunch falling
5886275 cca has delivered another strong profit result in tougher trading conditions with excellent performances from the australian and new zealand beverage businesses and the continued growth of our indonesian operations
5886276 the result has been driven by well balanced revenue and mix management and tight cost control programs across the business in addition cca continues to benefit from efficiency gains from its capital spending program while the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages contributed nearly 20 of the australian beverage business growth
5886277 the australian business delivered 10 0 ebit growth for the half despite being impacted by poor weather and heavy discounting by our major competitor in the first quarter the earnings result was driven by a strong second quarter trading performance with 2 0 volume growth while continuing to recover cost increases and grow margins
5886278 increasing pressure because of the combined effects of the drought and a higher currency
5886279 spc ardmona is proactively taking this restructure to ensure our business remains competitive in the australian and international markets
5886280 when i joined the project i knew it was something special just by the scripts and i knew russell t davies was involved and i was a big fan of his it has grown into something far beyond what i ever imagined its a bit overwhelming at times flattering and i get flown over to beautiful countries like this
5886281 it is more family orientated bbc1 but i think torchwood will be going on at the post watershed time so the adult themes are going to be there i think within the bbc that its sort of a promotion its more of a mainstream channel and because of torchwoods popularity and the success they felt it was worthy of bbc1 which is our main channel in the uk so its a bit of a promotion for us its really exciting
5886282 ive read the first script of the next season which is the beginning of what is going to be one big storyline all together its going to be like a 5 hour film really the tone as far as im concerned doesnt seem any more tame its very much still torchwood torchwood in the most vulnerable situations theyve been in so far
5886283 it was a decision by burn and naoko to come and tell us theyd been made aware it was ambiguous to me where the decisions came from or how they came about but they decided to tell us we were all sort of mortified it came out of nowhere it was just as surprising for us as it was to the fans and the emotions that you see at the end of the series where were deleting their files and putting their things away that this is all very real emotion because we had developed a family atmosphere we were very close spending that amount of time with somebody you do naturally
5886284 we tried to approach it the same way but we tried to have a bit more fun behind the scenes because we knew they were leaving and we knew we were going to miss them so we tried to make as much of the time as possible while they were still there
5886285 i can tell you that theyre both mentioned but i cant really divulge much more information beyond that really certainly their presence is going to be felt there as far as two new members i think were going to be joining torchwood at a point where theyre still recruiting theyre still very much feeling the loss of tosh and owen that sort of adds to the vulnerability they i was talking about as far as two new fully fledged members youll just have to wait and see
5886286 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board we were last aware that he remained in transit
5886287 the incessant churn of building destruction and redevelopment that characterizes the japanese city

5886290 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5886291 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5886292 with the older biblicism it i e biblical realism agrees that the bible is gods revelation and that we may therefore confidently turn toward the scriptures in search for the ultimate truth concering mans predicament vi
5886293 i confess that more light has come to me from the wisdom of ancient times than from modern speculations
5886294 learns from the attitude god takes toward sex that it has its metaphysical dignity and is no mere shortcut to pleasure and also that frar from being unessential for the constitution of true life it is used by god as the means for execution of his redemptive plans
5886295 see if you can guess why my mental housemate has suddenly decided to move out of my house

5886339 we did a gig once which was sort of a protest about children in refugee camps in australia
5886340 it was a 24 hour lock in in brisbane in a big cage in the middle of the city square there were bands playing non stop for 24 hours and we ate slept and played gigs in there so that was kind of like a detention centre but fun
5886341 the great escape is an amazing festival its sort of a half industry conference and half music festival they basically take over the whole town and they use every little venue in the place which is about thirty and theyre all pretty great its an incredibly vibrant city for the size of it
5886342 there were plenty of crazy antics none that i want my mum to read about though we didnt get to try any of their famous herbal drugs they had plenty of real drugs though well have to check the herbals out next time theyre probably better for you
5886343 we played two shows there one with the teenagers and one with a band called alpha beat we did a bunch of shows in london as well all the venues and the line ups were perfect we got a lot of support before we went over there from people getting us into the right shows it was amazing wed been overseas once before to la and it was good but kind of overwhelming this time we really felt like we fit in and we were well and truly up to scratch with the standard there
5886344 live nation are fantastic and were very lucky to have them involved were going back to the us later on this year and the uk so well strengthen those contacts and hopefully something will come out of it
5886345 then we had some hilarious technical difficulties as our mixing desk literally exploded and caught on fire so weve spent a lot of time finishing it i think in doing so weve had a huge number of songs to choose from so we could really construct the album in a direction that we really wanted to namely pretty up poppy and positive its a very clean record and that was what we were aiming for im really pleased the we achieved that aim so thoroughly
5886346 we worked very hard on the band from the get go and we made a lot of good contacts very very quickly
5886347 you see a lot of bands lose momentum and then that affects their morale and they break up
5886348 but weve been lucky in that sense its always been a steady upward curve its really important to keep up momentum and to balance that with not overexposing yourself i think what a lot of bands struggle with is momentum and having the energy to keep putting things out and staying organised looking one step ahead of the process every time
5886349 its a name that we came up with a long time ago because to be honest we were young and na ve but at the time it didnt have any of the political hot potato elements that it does now
5886350 we felt it was a name that conjured up more romantic images you know people setting off to find a new life leaving behind a place where they werent welcome i guess we have sort of felt especially in the past that we lacked a home musically we didnt feel like we fitted in to a scene so the name felt very fitting since then its obviously gained a lot of baggage but we still hold on to that more romantic image
5886351 chinese media according to the chinese constitution are free to report on the games
5886352 this was a decision of the directors to achieve the most theatrical effect
5886353 i think it is clear that the right information has to be given to the people
5886354 youre the deepest pain in my heart if i could see you stand on your feet again it would make me much more excited and happier than any praise ive received
5886355 la persistente censura sulla stampa gli abusi contro i lavoratori immigrati che hanno costruito le strutture olimpiche
5886356 the spanish daily la razon said the rule was one of a number of signs of censure and intolerance towards religious objects particularly those used by christians in china
5886357 its an honour to compete for canada at the olympics this will be
5886358 it was partly in order to draw attention to this censorship that reporters without borders organised a clandestine fm broadcast in

5886365 i dont care what identity groups could claim him he died an honorable american warrior
5886366 it is possible that there exist human emanations which are unknown to us
5886367 we have seen that the philosophers of science are in widespread agreement that empirical science depends for its operation upon subjective and intersubjective structures that allow objective knowledge to emerge and stabilize in the first place
5886368 is that a person who carries such an attitude certainly is prejudiced
5886369 matter is spirit at the lowest point of its cyclic activity
5886370 the distinction between matter and empty space finally had to be abandoned when it became evident that virtual particles can come into being spontaneously out of the void and vanish again into the void without any nucleon or other strongly interacting particle being present here then is the closest parallel to the void of eastern mysticism in modern physics
5886371 it is in the realm of so called mind that the great principle of separateness is found
5886372 the psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious it happens outside as fate that is to say when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner contradictions the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposite halves
5886373 from an inner center the psyche seems to move outward in the sense of an extraversion into the physical world
5886374 when the scientific temperament approaches the unseen it chooses the occult path of development and when the artistic temperament approaches the unseen it chooses the mystic path one progresses through right knowing and the other through right feeling and both meet in the end
5886375 we might speak of the mystic art and the occult science and in so speaking we are reminded that every art is based on a science and every applied science partakes of the nature of art
5886376 science is the art of creating suitable illusions which the fool believes or argues against but the wise man enjoys for their beauty or their ingenuity without being blind to the fact that they are human veils and curtains concealing the abysmal darkness of the unknowable
5886377 an immense mass of verbiage has gathered around the sacred science since madame blavatsky drew back the curtain of the sanctuary and the theosophical society sought to popularize the ancient mystery teaching
5886378 is no old fuddy duddy who isnt sure where he is going
5886379 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing i just wanted to be rid of this whole thing
5886380 so basically i had a prophelactic double mastectomy as people would say
5886381 i looked at all my options after seeing doctor after doctor and finally decided to have the other side also removed along with my ovaries
5886382 with my particular cancer its about 60 percent that it would return
5886383 i am not sure this is a trend that i would support until i see some long term statistical outcome five years from now i would want to see what the affect of the double prophelactic double mastectomy would be in the general population

5886405 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5886406 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought

5886425 kind of took us by surprise why it was handled
5886426 all pay has to be negotiated and this was pay for compensation we feel it was and it wasnt negotiated it was just handed out
5886427 somebody had done a survey and said if you just slow down ten mph youre gas mileage is going to be considerably higher
5886428 the officers are a whole lot more alert when theyre out patrolling because theyre not keeping up with the flow the flow is kinda keeping up with them
5886429 after a few weeks it does become routine its kinda like when you first get used to wearing your seat belt once in a while you might forget it but after a week or two you dont even thing about doing it

5886446 at this time very high standards of personal hygiene are needed to avoid spreading the ailment to others living in the home

5886457 creativity requires a mental process that is unfettered by past dogma and deductive reasoning but it is not anti scientific it is a critical part of the scientific process because it generates hypotheses that are later tested with experimental data and deductive thinking
5886458 the science of matter began 400 years ago with copernicus opposing the ptolemaic theory that the earth was in the center of the universe newtons theories of motion gravitation and light as well as his invention of calculus demonstrated that modeling could provide powerful explanations of how systems of matter worked
5886459 this stream of thinking has created a material science organizational design that inhibits creativity and therefore innovation
5886460 weve developed graphs and charts and maps to take us into the future revering them as ancient mariners did their chart books
5886461 we made organizations fit newtonian mechanical models by putting responsibilities into functions and people into roles with boundaries and a secure sense of control
5886462 we need bounded instability which is the framework in which nature innovates
5886463 our polling today shows mccain well outside the margin of error in both of those counties

5886477 if the mccain camp does that they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and put the conservative movement in the bleachers

5886493 we are delighted to today announce that one of the greats of australian football is a central coast mariner
5886494 since joining us as a triallist mark has proven to be an exceptional role model for not only the younger members of our playing group but also our senior players and i have every confidence that by mark continuing his stay with us in the capacity of a guest player we have significantly boosted our aspirations on and off the pitch for the current season
5886495 we as a club have been simply amazed by the work ethic mark has showcased since joining our playing group and cannot speak highly enough of the overwhelmingly positive effect his presence has had on our squad and our club
5886496 it has been a feature of our recruitment history to repatriate australias finest football exports and with mark on board we have continued this tradition and very happily and willingly provided a well deserved opportunity for one of the greats of the australian game to contribute to this most exciting time for football in this country

5886505 dont buy this crap dont read it dont believe it dont pass these lies on in email id rather lose the election on my own merits than win it because the american public believed anything this scumbag says
5886506 face to face interaction is like flushing the toilet bowl on the shit of the internet
5886507 how can i grow as many edible vegetables and plants as possible in this small shady spot so i can harvest tons of food
5886508 most of the touble you get into is because youre wound down
5886509 i just want somone to love somone to wake up next to and to hold and to be held
5886510 thats the magic moment when you get to connect two different worlds
5886511 many locals never dreamed someone in the us would care enough to come here
5886512 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5886513 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5886514 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing
5886515 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5886516 por curiosidade tenho mais estas duas linhas para acrescentar ao seu mui estimado conto
5886517 do not under any circumstances depend on a partial feeling
5886518 resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others
5886519 do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love
5886520 do no hold on to possessions you no longer need
5886521 do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful
5886522 do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age
5886523 respect buddha and the gods without counting on their help
5886524 in what belongs to the deeper meanings of nature and her mediation between us and god the appearances of nature are the truths of nature far deeper than any scientific discoveries in and concerning them
5886525 why the future of business is selling less of more
5886526 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5886527 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5886528 i am sorry for the discomfort caused but i am not sorry for the verbal diarrhea i made
5886529 media reports have suggested mr green could step aside as early as this week
5886530 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5886531 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday 21 august 2008 when necessary information is available to them to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5886532 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5886533 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5886534 im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5886535 its highly unlikely any of those choices are going to decisively impact the election
5886536 it could make a difference at the margins but the choice is much more about governing
5886537 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5886538 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5886539 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5886540 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5886541 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting
5886542 that said recent and further evidence of significant economic weakness makes it unlikely for the fed to push up interest rates this year
5886543 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5886544 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5886545 the u s economy is growing and showing great flexibility but were in a period of slow growth
5886546 when the housing sector returns we expect broader economic activity to return as well
5886547 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5886548 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5886549 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia
5886550 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond
5886551 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5886552 the russian occupation of my country is untenable it cannot be sustained
5886553 well thats what theyve done wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure reports of the use of munitions that should never be used against civilians the harassment along highways of legitimate comers the closing of the port of poti which is now starting to affect neighboring states
5886554 if intellectual property had a theme song it would have to be like a virgin
5886555 why because ip is all about the very first time the aha moment the creative spark that gives rise to previously undreamed imaginings
5886556 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5886557 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5886558 when im president there will be a whole lot more like them not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5886559 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now
5886560 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5886561 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
5886562 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5886563 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5886564 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5886565 the offer is very compelling in that it provides ausdrill shareholders with an above average takeover premium and provides them the opportunity to participate in a larger company with improved geographic and business diversification
5886566 the acquisition provides macmahon with increased scale in contract mining new capabilities in exploration drilling and increased geographic reach through ausdrills african operations
5886567 crown melbourne and burswood further cemented their leadership position in the australian casino industry
5886568 recent trading for the australian casino businesses has been satisfactory with total revenue excluding vip commission based play to 14 august up four per cent on last year
5886569 year on year growth in vip commission program play has been strong over the same period
5886570 the past year has been one of significant activity with the most important event being the separation of crown and pbl into two separately listed companies
5886571 this result was achieved despite the introduction of full smoking bans in bars on the main gaming floor and an increase in the victorian gaming machine levy during the year
5886572 mpel is on track to open city of dreams in the first half of 2009
5886573 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5886574 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5886575 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic
5886576 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5886577 in order for our system to not be in emergency status we need to have 47 beds empty on any given day or moment
5886578 john mccain was in a completely different building when sen
5886579 one of the most gifted running backs that ive been around for a long time very similar to terrell davis when he came in
5886580 john mccain was in a completely different building when sen
5886581 we like mr obama we hope that he will win the election
5886582 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5886583 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5886584 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5886585 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5886586 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5886587 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5886588 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5886589 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5886590 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5886591 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5886592 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5886593 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5886594 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5886595 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5886596 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5886597 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5886598 you can not use one set of pliers to build a house
5886599 search engine marketing is one of the most critical acquisition channels for many companies but it is clear that a significant portion of these investments are being wasted or underutilized
5886600 as search marketing becomes even more competitive marketers would be smart to investigate automated methods for increasing sem returns
5886601 we have customers that are realizing over 1 500 percent return on ad spend after switching from their old bid management tools
5886602 but more importantly all webtrends ad director customers have seen substantial gains over bid management while reducing the manual overhead associated with these outdated solutions with webtrends ad director we have struck the optimal balance between what machines can do best repetitive analysis testing and updates on a massive scale and the insight and perspective humans bring to search marketing decisions
5886603 we were able to achieve a much higher conversion rate and broader coverage of the online space while reducing staff hours dedicated to search campaign management by 50 percent
5886604 it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
5886605 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit
5886606 i dont recall anything as big since the decade of the civil war
5886607 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5886608 its a huge coup for us theres no more credible source
5886609 a tactical plan of which lobbying may be a part
5886610 our borders are where our security and future prosperity intersect the borders are getting more secure but the doors are not opened enough
5886611 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5886612 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
5886613 russia is very clearly isolating itself its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5886614 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5886615 does anybody really doubt that russia could use its overwhelming military advantage to beat up on a small neighbor well thats what theyve done
5886616 reports of the use of munitions that should never be used against civilians
5886617 the message is very clear and we will continue to consider what further consequences are appropriate as russia demonstrates this kind of behavior
5886618 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5886619 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5886620 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5886621 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5886622 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5886623 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5886624 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5886625 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5886626 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5886627 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
5886628 joe wont be afraid to get in mccains face which is what obama needs
5886629 quite the opposite they are spreading out to other regions
5886630 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this
5886631 if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response we have all the necessary resources political economic and military
5886632 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing
5886633 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5886634 its okay i guess but the other one was better
5886635 aint nothing but a heartache aint nothing but a mistake tell me why i never wanna hear you say i want it that way
5886636 we want to thank you all for 15 unbelievable years
5886637 we want to thank you for keeping the backstreet pride alive
5886638 i love jersey so much that i actually married a jersey girl
5886639 just to set the record straight my moms from jersey hackensack to be exact
5886640 blogging is not easy you may experience unexpected droughts of inspiration difficultly maintaining a schedule or succumb to the pressures of always needing fresh content
5886641 as any expert on web publishing will tell you the single most important thing you have to do to build a new blog is to post regular content
5886642 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5886643 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5886644 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5886645 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5886646 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5886647 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5886648 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5886649 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5886650 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5886651 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5886652 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5886653 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5886654 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5886655 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5886656 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5886657 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5886658 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5886659 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5886660 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5886661 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5886662 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5886663 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5886664 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5886665 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5886666 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5886667 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5886668 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5886669 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5886670 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5886671 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5886672 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5886673 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5886674 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5886675 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5886676 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5886677 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5886678 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5886679 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5886680 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5886681 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5886682 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5886683 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5886684 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5886685 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5886686 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
5886687 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5886688 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
5886689 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
5886690 my agents spoke with other teams but as far as signing there was none of them
5886691 to have that taken away from you that can be really hard
5886692 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5886693 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
5886694 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling
5886695 once off suspension well have an opportunity to see whether or not hed be a positive addition to the football team and go from there
5886696 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5886697 resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty
5886698 the cause is just it is the honour of france and its armies to defend it
5886699 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5886700 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5886701 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5886702 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5886703 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5886704 less than 0 001 percent of first generation ipod nanos
5886705 apple has received very few reports of such incidents which have been traced back to a single battery supplier there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5886706 if theres anything thats out of control in there theres very little room for error and im not surprised its happening to the nano
5886707 youre asking it to do a lot in a very very small package and thats pushing the envelope

5886713 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5886714 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5886715 this argument is not about shots to the moon or specific missions in space
5886716 this is a lot more about the economic side of the space program and the high tech high paying jobs that it creates
5886717 while im pleased the issue of space exploration is getting attention from our presidential candidates
5886718 sen mccains record of unwavering support for nasa speaks louder than obamas newfound appreciation for the space program
5886719 cultivate support for americas space program and increase much needed funding
5886720 america benefits when important issues like nasa are debated in a public forum
5886721 is no old fuddy duddy who isnt sure where he is going
5886722 me colocaram em uma camisa de for a e eu vou ter de decidir
5886723 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5886724 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5886725 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5886726 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5886727 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5886728 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5886729 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5886730 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5886731 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5886732 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5886733 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5886735 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5886736 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5886737 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5886738 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5886739 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5886740 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5886741 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5886742 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5886743 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5886744 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5886745 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5886746 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5886747 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5886748 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever

5886755 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5886756 they were kind enough to give me a few of the playboy bunny necklace that i wear in the film i mean theyre not that expensive but it means a lot
5886757 she was really kind to me i didnt really talk to many of the people on bobby but lindsay and i got along really well
5886758 then when they were struggling to find the character to play opposite her in i know who killed me lindsay suggested me i met with the producers and got the part it seemed to be a pretty good role and the cast was great
5886759 but lindsay was going through a lot of personal things in the media and there was a lot of pressure on her shes a tremendous talent but she was very young and she was basically carrying this multi million movie
5886760 ive got nothing bad to say about lindsay she helped me buy my house
5886761 it appears they may have been sleeping in the dumpster and from their descriptions were poorly dressed and looked like they are in need
5886762 according to store employees the children are two boys aged about four and six years old and a girl aged about nine years
5886763 we patrolled all the bins overnight theres definitely no one sleeping there
5886764 our investigations lead us to believe that we think the kids were playing in the area at the time
5886765 the local docs people think they may know the family the kids came from and they are trying to confirm it today
5886766 i dont think she realized the talent she had it was hard for her to be in the spotlight she didnt want to offend anyone
5886767 every once in awhile id be like why arent they trying
5886768 now after sitting im going to give it 100 percent all the time
5886769 after while it overwhelms you because you want to play
5886770 once i got the captain role i said to myself i need to be here for my team and not be so selfish
5886771 we had a lot of good things going for us so i wasnt going to be like poor me
5886772 when i first got in i was kind of freaked out
5886773 it was justice that she got to be part of our season statistically
5886774 theyre hardly an appropriate judge of character theyll do anyone in spandex
5886775 when you make a game based on a license you really are playing roulette you dont know how the film is going play out in the market when we were first asked to do speed racer the property it was incredible it was very exciting it was a film by the wachowski brothers and it was about car racing awesome thats going to make a great game were in a unique situation with the game were like 40 metacritic points above the film usually the film and the game mirror each other quite closely on review scores we released on the same time frame as ironman which was very successful film the games didnt review very well but we know that ironman games sold very well
5886776 this type of industry support certainly bolsters our belief that the time for the us bx is now
5886777 we are excited with the building momentum and look forward to announcing more developments in this important project

5886780 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today

5886782 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
5886783 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
5886784 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
5886785 the sad fact is that come christmas time we estimate that one million australians will suffer mortgage stress thats a huge number of people that are potentially going to face losing their property unless drastic action is taken
5886786 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing

5886794 i have sent a statement to the nato public affairs headquarters recommending that the science and economics committee of nato parliament be postponed it was to have been held in moscow in september
5886795 we are also putting on the agenda for the november meeting in spain not only the russian georgian situation but also russias participation and relationship with the nato parliamentary assembly
5886796 we the united states cannot force russia down by ourselves
5886797 it will have to be a combination of diplomatic and economic pressures to deal with this situation rather than just straight military we are bogged down in iraq to the extent that it would be hard for us to do a whole lot militarily
5886798 theres no question we need more domestic production of crude oil in the short term but that alone is not going to solve the energy problem its going to require a comprehensive program that not only encourages exploration offshore continental shelf wherever but also the development of alternative sources whether its wind solar or ethanol or whatever
5886799 hopefully we can begin to address the horrible deficit situation
5886800 we have now the largest deficit weve ever had and this cannot continue indefinitely not only can we not pay it back we are transferring our tax base to interest which leaves us unable to meet the needs of the american people in terms of education and health care

5886808 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5886809 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5886810 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5886811 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5886812 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5886813 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5886814 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5886815 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5886816 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5886817 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5886818 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5886819 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

5886922 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5886923 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5886924 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5886925 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5886926 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5886927 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5886928 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5886929 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5886930 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5886931 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5886932 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5886933 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5886934 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5886935 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5886936 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5886937 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5886938 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5886939 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5886940 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5886941 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5886942 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5886943 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5886944 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5886945 the situation today is nothing like the cold war times
5886946 nobody has a good idea of what is to be done
5886947 the us is imposing a new cold war on russia
5886948 to destroy the long range nuclear arsenals of russia or china with a first strike
5886949 complete encirclement of russia and then the loss of its sovereignty
5886950 if they violate our borders they should be shot down
5886951 the era of russian geopolitical concessions is coming to an end
5886952 compensates for the geopolitical harm the united states is doing to russia
5886953 accountable for the ominous security threats developing between natos eastern border and russia
5886954 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5886955 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5886956 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5886957 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5886958 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5886959 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5886960 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5886961 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5886962 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5886963 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5886964 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5886965 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5886966 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5886967 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5886968 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5886969 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5886970 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5886971 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5886972 after the meeting with the comrade he went directly to the guest house and had dinner at this very moment the fedayee is in his bedroom making love to his bodyguard the one i knew was his latest lover hes playing tiger again the officer monitoring his microphones connected me live with the bedroom and the squawling almost broke my eardrums arafat was roaring like a tiger and his lover yelping like a hyena

5887043 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5887044 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5887045 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5887046 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5887047 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5887048 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5887049 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5887050 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5887051 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5887052 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5887053 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5887054 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5887055 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5887056 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5887057 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5887058 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5887059 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5887060 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5887061 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5887062 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5887063 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5887064 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5887065 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5887066 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5887067 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5887068 the universe keeps shoving vesuvius right back in my face
5887069 i am unapologetic i dont write about things unless theyre true im a grown ass woman and ive experienced grown ass things
5887070 he was like a surfing jim morrison he lived in the fast lane but had an incredibly dark side to his character id really like to explore that
5887071 i mean he was the stepson of clark gable and he inherited a vast fortune as the heir to the spreckels sugar millions but there was this other side to him
5887072 theres this great documentary about his short life called bunker 77 he was a fascinating guy
5887073 i want a half a dozen what do you expect from me i want 12 kids
5887074 sometimes i get sad because sometimes im out of town a lot
5887075 luckily hes used to it because both of his parents are in the business so hes used to always being in transit and its not so hard on him but i feel guilty a lot
5887076 i was raised in the south and my mom was a strict disciplinarian its really easy for me to lay out the rules and make sure that the rules are followed constantly but i think because hes from a home with divorced parents its hard for brian to punish him kassius
5887077 he feels bad that cash has to always go through the transition in switching homes
5887078 its just water and raw apple cider vinegar and it just cleans out your system entirely
5887079 it will get rid of for women who retain water weight from your menstrual cycle and all that it gets rid of it really fast sic
5887080 im not one for dieting or exercising cause im lazy and i have a really big sweet tooth so i have to do cleanses every once in a while cause of the amount of sugar i take in
5887081 last we checked if youre a virgin you wouldnt need to take a pregnancy test
5887082 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5887083 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5887084 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5887085 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5887086 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5887087 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5887088 id be very surprised if any of these bags were being reused because the stores are just handing them out as a replacement for the old checkout bags
5887089 was to have consistency with a ban all the way across or to require that the bags be compostable
5887090 they need to deplete that supply fast and switch to paper my feelings are that theyre exploiting the intent of the law
5887091 i f you do not lay off poor violet blue the porn star i will absolutely see to it that the world is reminded about how you abused the legal process against a struggling single mother between now and the end of my time on this planet nobody confused the two of you shes pretty youre not she does porn films you give bad sex advice
5887092 i am a woman i do not take these things lightly
5887093 how far would he go i didnt want to find out
5887094 i have never threatened violence to blue in any way
5887095 unfortunately there is not yet such a thing as an internet stay away order
5887096 there needs to be one that does not violate the first amendment but i guess no ones charted that territory yet
5887097 violets looks are a threat to my ability to keep my food down can i sue for that
5887098 were just going to sue to get him to stop
5887099 as soon as you do something that puts someone elses rights in question youre fair game
5887100 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5887101 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5887102 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5887103 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5887104 the doctor prescribed a painkiller and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5887105 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5887106 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5887107 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5887108 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5887109 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5887110 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5887111 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5887112 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5887113 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5887114 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5887115 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5887116 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5887117 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

5887331 theres other races around for him in sydney but well see how he goes in the golden rose first
5887332 charming rogue cant do much better than win five from five here and the trip away will toughen both of them up
5887333 charming rogue is a december foal thats why ive only been able to give him five starts
5887334 hell come back from sydney a better horse no matter what happens and hell be a lot stronger for next years winter carnival
5887335 seeyou judge me not triskele and moulin lady have been nominated for the caulfield guineas
5887336 seeyou has come back well from a spell and will have a barrier trial next week
5887337 ive only got four in work and i want to keep it that way unless someone comes to me with a redoutes choice
5887338 ive trained three winners at the gold coast but ive had heaps of placings and ive only got four in work
5887339 the horses ive got arent over blessed in ability but ive got a couple coming through which show some promise but they havent raced yet
5887340 one is called zaman which is by zabeel and is a half brother to show a heart
5887341 unfortunately hes a four year old gelding and hasnt raced because hes just had an operation to remove a cyst under his jaw
5887342 i hope hell run well but hes gone up in weight in his last few starts
5887343 with the claim hes got some chance and his last win was good
5887344 ive only had three or four runners in brisbane since ive been on the gold coast and hopefully this old bloke will be my first winner
5887345 in the previous three years only makybe diva 124 in 2005 06 had achieved a rating higher than 120
5887346 having three individual horses el segundo weekend hussler and apache cat rated above that mark this season underlines the growing reputation of australian horses which has been further enhanced by the group one win of haradasun at royal ascot
5887347 i try to explain to them racing nsw that they are denying horses a chance to progress through the grades but they dont listen theyve got no idea
5887348 both were three year olds winning their first races they should have been rated the same
5887349 the explanation given to me by racing nsw for the extra ratings points was that my bloke has placed a couple of times in town but that should have nothing to do with it
5887350 hes done very well and i couldnt be happier with him
5887351 it was a tough win there was a scrimmage he got bumped and then bumped into another horse and he did a good job to balance up again
5887352 a race like that would be nice but whether hes up to it well find out along the way i just dont know at this stage
5887353 hes a horse whos been looking for a bit of ground and hopefully he can continue to head in the right direction tomorrow
5887354 all i know at this stage is that the way the handicappers are treating him well probably be forced to look at set weight races
5887355 he was stepping up from 1300 to a mile 1600m after a freshen up so ill give him the benefit of the doubt
5887356 my president is black my lambos blue ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
5887357 when i pulled up in my car that shit was unbelievable to people in my neighborhood because they were like we grew up with him
5887358 i feel like it was the same way with obama i grew up all this time but ive never seen a black man this close to running this country

5887365 seeing another human being of another race or creed or religion having the mick taken out of them its just not on
5887366 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5887367 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5887368 were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5887369 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how garth and doherty would react
5887370 but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnectiong
5887371 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5887372 i mean brothers and sisters the appointed time has grown short for the present form of the world is passing away

5887376 many technology companies have moved their development and support functions from australia to china and india but for red hat the growth of these two economies has contributed to the expansion of our operations in australia
5887377 a number of engineering functions are headquartered in brisbane including internationalization research and development content services which create the media and documentation for our products and localization services
5887378 the global support services team in brisbane is one of three follow the sun support centres that function 24 hours a day seven days a week
5887379 the brisbane team also provides support in english and japanese to our customers around the world and supports our technical teams across asia pacific
5887380 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5887381 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5887382 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5887383 there was no ecological damage we didnt have a fish kill
5887384 it reflects a larger pattern which is his companys record of polluting oregons waterways and his votes in washington to roll back environmental regulation
5887385 as there are no direct flights to london hes boasted he may just disappear into asia and start his life afresh

5887387 one night i was just relaxing at home watching a movie and i thought to myself why dont i look on myspace just maybe she might be on there
5887388 so i typed in her name and hers was the first picture that popped up
5887389 the first thing i asked him was have you had a good life
5887390 i just want to give him a big hug and even though hes a man and not a little boy i just want to hold him until theres no tomorrow
5887391 it was like it was the missing jigsaw to my whole life
5887392 thaddeus stephens wears a george bush mask as he protests against john mccain in front of a group of mccain supporters at the marriott marquis
5887393 this misguided policy will increase ticket prices for consumers and hurt struggling small market airports while doing nothing to relieve or mitigate delays
5887394 this is a tragedy anytime somebody dies anytime somebodys killed thats a tragedy but one has a right to act in self defense
5887395 he was traumatized and upset about what had happened and had been up all night long and he had several drinks
5887396 there does not appear to be any pattern of any type where there is an attempt to harm someone
5887397 rummaging around in the drivers license records and those types of things
5887398 there is at this point no evidence whatsoever any public officials were targeted or any political maneuverings going on
5887399 i know anything that involves the thp is juicy fodder
5887400 but the last couple of years theyve done an awful lot to clean that place up
5887401 ironically its the films that allowed me to progress spiritually to the point i left mormonism
5887402 there was indian cinema for the indian community gay and lesbian cinema was starting to mature there was black cinema
5887403 i realized theres 12 million mormons in this country and we dont have a cinema of our own
5887404 but after filming several other of the genres touchstone works dutcher renounced mormonism last year citing a theological evolution he calls
5887405 one of the best small pictures of its kind in recent memory
5887406 in one moment i went from being a true believer to knowing that everything i had thought about god everything i thought about the universe the way i looked at the world might be off
5887407 ironically its the films that allowed me to progress spiritually to the point i left mormonism if i hadnt been making films i doubt i would have reached that point
5887408 at that point the representation of mormons on tv and in movies had been pretty negative it was all polygamy and crazy people really extreme and marginal
5887409 one of my main impulses was to portray mormons as real people
5887410 too many badly made films in the marketplace too few good ones
5887411 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
5887412 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
5887413 richard became a local lightning rod because he accepted what might be called an ill informed and premature title like the father of mormon cinema
5887414 he didnt make it up nor did he ask for it but i think hes also done little to distance himself from it
5887415 what youre seeing on his face is exhaustion and despair
5887416 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5887417 one of the make up artists at tv show pushing daises was like whats your next album gonna be and i said i dunno he was like how about for the gays i was like genius that is going to be the title of my next album for the gays
5887418 i am devastated that due to the loss of a major investor in the harsh reality of a slowing economy there were no other options at this time than to postpone
5887419 i could not in good conscience move forward without full confidence that the capitalisation was in place and that all of those employed by the production could be responsibly taken care of
5887420 my passion for this vibrant production is unwavering and it is my goal to regroup as soon as possible
5887421 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

5887429 not impossible but improbable that canfield will be no 2 at stanford
5887430 i dont know anything more than you know said riley of the condition of no
5887431 theres no definitive statement back from the doctors yet on the tests that were taken
5887432 i think were reaching the point where its not impossible but improbable that he would be ready to be the back up at stanford
5887433 i think hes doing very well said riley of no
5887434 i think he would function and run our offense but i would like to look at this a year from now
5887435 and the second back on third down against the cardinal
5887436 hes practicing at speed right now so he should be able to do that
5887437 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
5887438 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future
5887439 the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5887440 it wants to be a part of these institutions that are so essential to the international economy and the international order and on the other hand it wants to engage in kind of soviet style behavior of intimidating and invading neighbors both cant be true

5887450 i sigh reach down to the floor pick up a m249 squad automatic weapon and empty a 200 round magazine into the warrior
5887451 thats happened to me twice in my career and believe me its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back or wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back from what happened this offseason
5887452 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
5887453 believe me i wanted to win the game but i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
5887454 thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed
5887455 im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league and were just trying to get better this week
5887456 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
5887457 if im going to come out here and practice i want to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it and whatever eric wants to do we havent really talked about it
5887458 for the most part its the things that people dont see that weve got to get on board with in a hurry
5887459 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using a term thats already in place or maybe coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things i mean its a work in progress and i think thatll be the case all year long
5887460 in our 2 minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try
5887461 we kind of just turned it loose today we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
5887462 i said well theres no substitute for game type situations the 2 minute drills red zone situations third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5887463 he wouldve wanted me to play all along and im sure it wouldve been in green bay but hed probably be out here at practice every day raising hell with me what i could be doing better he wouldve wanted me to play until my legs fell off thats just the way he was
5887464 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
5887465 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5887466 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5887467 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5887468 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5887469 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5887470 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5887471 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit

5887475 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5887476 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5887477 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5887478 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5887479 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5887480 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5887481 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5887482 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5887483 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5887484 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5887485 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5887486 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5887487 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5887488 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5887489 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5887490 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5887491 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5887492 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5887493 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5887494 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5887495 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5887496 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5887497 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5887498 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5887499 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5887500 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5887501 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5887502 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5887503 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5887504 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5887505 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5887506 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

5887509 its not a secret that we are in serious settlement discussions with a large segment of the remainder of the cases
5887510 what were trying to do is factor age out of decision making
5887511 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
5887512 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
5887513 sometimes i get sad because sometimes im out of town a lot brian works but hes always in town and i have to travel a lot and sometimes thats hard because itll be weeks and weeks without seeing cash kassius and thats sad
5887514 luckily hes used to it because both of his parents are in the business so hes used to always being in transit and its not so hard on him but i feel guilty a lot
5887515 i was raised in the south and my mom was a strict disciplinarian its really easy for me to lay out the rules and make sure that the rules are followed constantly but i think because hes from a home with divorced parents its hard for brian to punish him kassius
5887516 he was like a surfing jim morrison he lived in the fast lane but had an incredibly dark side to his character id really like to explore that
5887517 i mean he was the stepson of clark gable and he inherited a vast fortune as the heir to the spreckels sugar millions but there was this other side to him
5887518 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5887519 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5887520 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5887521 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5887522 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5887523 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5887524 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5887525 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5887526 graffiti is an epidemic and through our graffiti enforcement program we are telling the graffiti vandals we mean business
5887527 i hope other jurisdictions will implement similar graffiti enforcement efforts
5887528 how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ
5887529 i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made
5887530 we all did a double take because she was dating pro skater terry kennedy
5887531 i dont do drama and altercations unless its verbal because i can mediate that
5887532 if aliens were to attack my beloved earth what video game characters would i assemble to combat them
5887533 i am devastated that due to the loss of a major investor in the harsh reality of a slowing economy there were no other options at this time than to postpone
5887534 i could not in good conscience move forward without full confidence that the capitalisation was in place and that all of those employed by the production could be responsibly taken care of
5887535 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5887536 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5887537 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

5887545 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5887546 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5887547 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5887548 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5887549 youre going to raise taxes in a bad economy are you nuts
5887550 were so looking forward to working with each again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
5887551 east asians focus more on the central region of faces to extract information in a holistic global fashion

5887554 we need them to play hard we cant accomplish anything if they are just standing there theyre a big part of what it takes to win a football game and i saw a much better effort today
5887555 at positions like a back and wide receiver im not sure its all that important who starts anyway
5887556 well probably play four or five players at each of those positions
5887557 beckhams story is a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love and what it means to lead your country
5887558 his rise from obscurity to international stardom his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman and his hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable
5887559 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5887560 to come to the conclusion that i am homophobic from these sentences is far from the truth some of my friends and colleagues are gay and if i was truly homophobic then i have picked the wrong industry
5887561 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5887562 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience

5887724 that the casualties of an a bomb attack might be reduced if the population had been well prepared in advance to react appropriately to the flash of the explosion
5887725 of the 50 000 or more deaths which would ordinarily result from a single attack on a modern city about 10 000 could be avoided if every person in the city were adequately informed beforehand as to what he could do for himself in case of an a bomb disaster

5887736 the authority has been working hard to remove privet from all council managed land and we need the cooperation of landowners to treat the weed on their land
5887737 the authority receives many complaints from people suffering from allergies triggered by the privet pollen privet is also an aggressive invader of disturbed land and can have a significant impact on native bush areas

5887743 we were thrilled with the outcome of last years event and its great to have a supportive crew on board this year to help us reach an even more ambitious fundraising target
5887744 everyone has been hard at work sticking to training schedules and organising night and day to make this event a huge success we are relying on the armidale community to make it all worthwhile and get behind the riders and show their support for ronald mcdonald house in the hunter
5887745 it felt a lot better than expected it wasnt frightening or confronting

5887748 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5887749 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5887750 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5887751 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought

5887760 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5887761 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5887762 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18

5887766 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5887767 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5887768 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5887769 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5887770 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5887771 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5887772 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5887780 they take everything personally they see their dad or mom coming and going and they hear these things about the war and theyre probably set up for anxiety disorder
5887781 it affects their school work it affects their future relationships their ability to make relationships
5887782 the kids have got to be suffering they might start using alcohol or drugs and they dont know why so it would be good for them to come in

5887807 well sir i believe i am here because of the robbery and perhaps more importantly the robber and even more pertinently how he got away
5887808 yes yes the description you gave was colourful to say the least he just vanished that is what you put in the report and that report is currently in front of me now you are here to elucidate these claims
5887809 and do you have an explanation as to how this miracle occurred
5887810 so you expect me to believe that a man 5 foot 5 dark hair freckled complexion in possession of 500 recently taken from the national bank boise idaho simply vanished
5887811 no sir whether or not you believe it is up to you i am only reporting what i saw
5887812 yes you do know that any other officers on the scene do not corroborate your version of the events
5887813 they saw it too sir they were just too afraid to deal with it and what it represents
5887814 that everything we know is wrong that somethings happen for which we have no explanation
5887815 mr hittenburg i am in one of my more charitable moods im going to give you a choice here i do hope you choose wisely you can help with the honourable setting up and running of a new department or you can return to boise with your career fatally wounded colleagues amp co workers telling all manner of lurid atrocious stories the stories am i sure you have already heard from behind semi closed doors you may wonder correctly for i credit you with a little intelligence why me let me elucidate you have been chosen due to the simple fact of your unwise choice of honesty it amuses me that you choose this of all things to take a stand over most people would bury it deep and never look at it again but you you reported it amp filed it fully aware of the ridicule it would inspire i can use someone with that sense of purpose however misguided i would like you to meet a colleague of mine
5887816 mr daniels is of a similar breed to your recently absconded thief different but no less miraculous
5887817 welcome to a brave new world mr hittenburg so are we to send you back to boise or has your interest been obtained
5887818 i have seen the future baby and it is murder
5887819 violence naked force has settled more issues in history than has any other factor and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst

5887834 manawatu have not had a challenge since 1991 so we just want to go out and enjoy the moment well certainly have a crack
5887835 we started poorly against waikato and gave away too many easy points which put us under pressure
5887836 we showed a lot of character coming back for the draw but we cant afford a similar start against auckland
5887837 but theres a lot of belief within the squad after beating canterbury we know if we front we can be competitive but weve got to front up for 80 minutes
5887838 its time for big corporations to pay their fair share

5887865 the governing board discussed several pros and cons of purchasing the property with mayor bayliss asking if there is a time issue
5887866 city manager hartman stated there is and the city would like to let the owners know by tomorrow
5887867 they can instruct their negotiating agent but they are not supposed to take that kind of buying action in a closed session
5887868 so what you have is a provision with no teeth
5887869 were asking the county to keep their offices in new bern
5887870 we spent the money to hire a consultant to tell the county why their stuff needs to stay in new bern so to put our own offices in james city doesnt spark me as setting a good example
5887871 we could have put them in five points we could have put them in a place that needs help
5887872 im kind of curious why we didnt vote in open session this time
5887873 we might have already approved the purchase in an earlier work session scotts reviewing it
5887874 we need our young players to step up and do well
5887875 we need young players to play like they are juniors or seniors to fill rolls they may not have to do it for 90 minutes maybe we have two players split in the game or one player playing 60 minutes and one player playing 30 to get comfortable
5887876 i think the freshmen are definitely coming in and filling those weak spots that we have had in the past it should be exciting to see how they gel with the returners the depth is really exciting its nice to know that if someone is tired or an injury happens on the field that we have a girl right there waiting to jump on the field and is just as good as the girl before her
5887877 we have a lot higher expectations than we did last year
5887878 we had a really good season and went to the big ten tournament this year i think we are going to expect a lot more and hope to do better in the big ten and better in the big ten tournament
5887879 i think we should be really excited about the opening weekend
5887880 drake is a super opponent one of the top teams in the missouri valley for really over this past decade with western illinois coming in who just missed out on an ncaa berth and south dakota state was picked to finish third in its league it will be a great start for us malibu will be fun and i think it will be fun for some of our californian players who will be able to go home and see not just parents but family friends and maybe former club coaches or high school coaches who will come out and support them
5887881 i dont know if we have turned the corner yet i think our team said it best when they talked about the philosophy of the program last year we put in there as a rebuilding program this year we put in there as an emerging program
5887882 i love playing penn state because they are a dynasty
5887883 they have been dominating the big ten penn state will be our biggest competition but we always play good soccer against them because they play good soccer it is always a nice game to see how we rise up to the occasion
5887884 i dont know if we have turned the corner yet
5887885 i think our team said it best when they talked about the philosophy of the program last year we put in there as a rebuilding program this year we put in there as an emerging program emerging programs probably still have not turned the corner but we are a lot farther ahead than we were a few years ago i like that term in order to emerge this year i think it becomes as simple as against all of our opponents cutting down their scoring chances adding more to ours and finishing on some of those

5887895 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual e mail accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
5887896 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
5887897 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today

5887911 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5887912 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5887913 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5887914 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5887915 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5887916 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field

5887918 the three of us have had some amazing times training and sightseeing here in china
5887919 however i think i can speak for all of us when i say we are very ready to begin competing
5887920 i have set my expectations high for this competition but feel they are very realistic
5887921 my goal is to make the finals and once there leave everything on the track i feel that i have the tools needed to make the final and once there i will do everything in my power to bring home a medal
5887922 for me approaching the olympic games is quite different than preparing to compete in u s trials
5887923 at the trials i was one of the favorites to make the team and i was also competing in front of my home crowd those things add a certain amount of pressure that can be tough to deal with
5887924 out here i dont think i am expected to make the finals and though i am racing in front of five times as many people i feel less pressure because im not at home obviously the level of competition is much greater here at the games but i feel confident in my ability to rise to the occasion
5887925 i have made so many new friends and had so many interesting experiences
5887926 the chinese people have been incredible and the olympic village is something else
5887927 ive always considered myself a citizen of the world and to sit down in a room and hear a dozen different languages being spoken at the same time is awesome
5887928 ive made an effort to go outside of the usa track and field team to meet athletes from other teams and other nations and im pleased to see how friendly everyone is
5887929 andrew will take one race at a time and will approach the prelims with the same energy that he used throughout the olympic trials in eugene
5887930 i expect him to be a good competitor and to set himself up to advance
5887931 the reality of all of this is that this is a new and exciting experience for him
5887932 intellectually i think that it will be a tall order to advance however he has been able to accomplish some incredible goals this year and rise to the occasion

5887973 i dont see how i could go out there and help the team
5887974 i dont think i could pitch effectively to begin with or come back and pitch the next day
5887975 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and we got a great chance to go to the playoffs you want to be a part of that and so for me im very frustrated
5887976 summarizes a series of large scale studies comparing juveniles who have been transferred to adult with those who have remained in juvenile courts
5887977 all of the studies found higher recidivism rates among offenders who had been transferred to criminal court compared with those who were retained in the juvenile system thus the extant research provides sound evidence that transferring juvenile offenders to the criminal court does not engender community protection by reducing recidivism on the contrary transfer substantially increases recidivism

5887981 this code is consistent with what our efforts and current best practices and is one more way we can let students and families know we are working to best serve their needs
5887982 we in the attorney generals office appreciate the collaborative effort by the major universities in the district in agreeing to a code of conduct that should reassure students and parents that the financial aid offices are committed to working in the best interests of the borrowers
5887983 its important to make sure that students and families know were working in their best interest

5887989 we will match the 40 000 and the development application is currently being considered by council
5887990 we have to make sure all environmental concerns are addressed and sometimes the process does take a bit of time
5887991 trying to get it all done within a 12 month period can be an interesting exercise
5887992 our objective will be to try and get the work completed during the off season the last thing we want is to have the facility out of order during the peak season
5887993 the community in particular the facility users have been keen partners in this it is a good project and council is doing its best to respond to community needs
5887994 we think its important for merimbula because fishing is a major drawcard for the area its part of merimbulas residential economic and social footprint thats why people come here

5887998 the community has been very supportive of this project and its only a matter of a few months before pambula has its own bank
5887999 i am not objecting to the owners wanting to improve their property but it shouldnt be at the expense of other residents this will have a visual impact on our property
5888000 buildings in pambula beach should not obstruct other view corridors
5888001 the way the street is arranged now is a fair way to share the views on offer and it has been this way for over 30 years councillors should consider themselves in this situation
5888002 people on the lower side of the street will want to maximise their view at the expense of others and i am fearful that it will keep happening
5888003 it will be view taking rather than view sharing and there will be a domino effect
5888004 if you were to put the house any further down on the block it would impact on neighbours and result in a loss of privacy which would have a far greater impact than the loss of view predicted

5888009 i feel our government is now drawing the line in a place with which canadians are comfortable and i continue to review new information as it comes forward

5888101 obviously it is of extreme concern to us so we are making investigations and have notified docs
5888102 there is considerable risk involved so we treat it seriously but there is also the chance that the kids may have just been playing in the area
5888103 at this stage docs cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin and were not just playing in the vicinity
5888104 however concerns remain that the children were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for the winter weather and were without any adult supervision
5888105 once the children have been located docs will work to secure their ongoing safety and well being
5888106 a lot of people said they were coming here in july to save on the extra costs associated with coming in december
5888107 there also hasnt been so many families this winter mainly couples
5888108 it has been quiet but overall i think people were pretty pleased with july with some accommodation places booked out
5888109 we were at nine percent occupancy for the month which is our worst result in the six years we have been here
5888110 it has never been that bad before and i think the town was deserted from what i could tell
5888111 july this year was dramatically down we were at 12 percent occupancy which means we are not even making rent this month
5888112 it has been the worst month we have seen in the four years we have been here
5888113 i find it hard to believe that the visitors information centre can say that july was the best month because as a motel in merimbula we really struggled
5888114 i think it also has a lot to do with the amount of accommodation we have here in merimbula and the fact that we need to get more quality entertainment in town to draw people here
5888115 quality entertainment has really dropped off in recent years and when people come here there is just nothing for them to do
5888116 i think we are wearing the brunt of the financial hardship people are suffering from petrol prices and mortgage repayments
5888117 i mean this was the worst season for us and the weather has probably been the best ever it has been sunny nearly every day
5888118 at the moment we are just surviving not making any money
5888119 the further out of town you get the worse it gets merimbula sort of fills up from the middle and works its way out
5888120 ours is a tourism based motel and a lot of our customer base comes in off the road
5888121 when we started we were getting about two or three off the road customers every day now we are lucky to get one every three days or so there just isnt the same traffic coming into town
5888122 we are fully booked out for august and september it has been really busy with a lot of forward bookings which is very positive
5888123 there have been a number of promotions on we saw the quiet time coming and acted early
5888124 it has been surprisingly quite good and august is shaping up that way as well we have been booked out for a few days
5888125 we had one elderly couple who were booked in for two weeks and on their way up to queensland
5888126 they cancelled the trip and ended up staying here for six and a half weeks they said why drive
5888127 we will never pull out our priests because they are shepherds and shepherds are willing to die for their sheep
5888128 i told my companions to calm down hide and observe whats going on and there we saw heavily armed men around the church
5888129 some 14 heavily armed men speaking in maguindanaoan dialect stood at the gates of the holy cross parish but did not attempt to enter the church premises nor the holy cross high school a diocesan school under religious sisters of mercy
5888130 i know the people here i know their dialect and i am hoping all these conflicts would end sooner

5888144 we also see our weaknesses and what is lacking in our response and so we call upon all the people of god in the diocese of maasin to be committed to these synod decrees as a sign of our determination to renew ourselves and build more effectively the reign of god here in the diocese of maasin

5888213 first off let me make it perfectly clear i am
5888214 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5888215 indeed mr obama appeared to misstate his position on saturday when he said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level his campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law those concerns did not exist for the federal bill because there is no federal abortion law

5888219 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities

5888241 do you beleive that mccain got the answers was briefed or perhaps was not even in the cone of silence room i kid you not and here we have it it is being reported that all our assumptions may be true
5888242 the cone of silence did not ahve the decency to admit that he was not even where he should have been mccain needs to stop following in the footsteps of his fellow rebublicans and be honest
5888243 a source at the debate tells me that mccain had access to some communications devices in the few minutes before he went on stage with you and that there was a monitor in his green room in violation of the debate rules

5888247 david the tide has been turning in mccains favor for a while now its about time that the press realized what the american people already have with this forum mccain just showed exactly what he is a very formidable candidate that obama will in no way walk all over in fact he answered the questions way more eloquently than obama i can see now why obama will not do town hall meetings with mccain hed blow him out of the water obama is all talk with very little substance to back it up this forum showed that in spades
5888248 the cross is a central symbol this could have happened twice
5888249 the old man will be blown out of the water
5888250 thats not the issue when not prepped and rehearsed to a fare thee well mccain freezes and looks momentarily like a doddering old man
5888251 the only reason you dont like wont vote for obama is that youre a racist
5888252 id seek the opinions of the former presidents to add to my own experience and advisors analysis
5888253 you can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool me
5888254 these results confirm that the confidence we have expressed in the past six months about our guidance was well founded managing director michael fraser said
5888255 opportunities have come my way and i count myself as quite lucky
5888256 i thought id be crazy if i didnt apply for it thats where my strengths lie and i wanted the position
5888257 i was a bone carving tutor especially for rangitane iwi i have some greenstone pounamu but im waiting for the right tools
5888258 my own family has been my biggest support if i can count on anyone its them without question
5888259 its a bit funny being welcomed on to your own marae but its not just for me its the whole position being welcomed my whanau know me but they dont know my position the powhiri is for us for the benefit of the iwi
5888260 a lot of the work in the community has a direct impact on the 2006 to 2009 plan and it needs to be looked at again
5888261 ive had a bit to do with the maori health providers and the work they do the iwi health board with nicola ehau the director of maori health for the nelson marlborough district health board is working hard in those areas
5888262 we need a balance in all four areas to have a healthy life if one is out of balance your roof falls and foundations crumble i have an affinity to that model of health and i feel it works for everyone
5888263 this is a particularly pleasing result given the increasingly challenging economic environment in many markets and it confirms the strength of our business models
5888264 we continue to win significant new business in both existing and new markets and we have made excellent early progress in the implementation of our growth strategy
5888265 our performance makes me optimistic about the medium to longer term growth outlook for brambles
5888266 i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5888267 so i decided in my mind to come here to earn money and support my mother
5888268 im very proud to work for here because this vineyard is the biggest area in new zealand and im the one of the workers in here so im very lucky
5888269 new zealand people always try to explain some locations if we dont know
5888270 original rallys and will sale without 17s if not wanted
5888271 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5888272 the way nato assesses the fulfilment of this condition is biased they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side
5888273 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5888274 the resolution is a waste of time let me tell you its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
5888275 theres no signs as i mentioned that they are preparing for the withdrawal
5888276 in gori no one told us to leave or helped us to leave no one no car would stop now i see that we must take care of ourselves even here
5888277 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5888278 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5888279 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5888280 we are pleased that the president and congress worked together to enact meaningful legislation that protects and enables families in this country to continue to strive for and enjoy the dream of homeownership
5888281 this federal housing package represents a significant move in the right direction for california homeowners
5888282 the measure will not only help thousands of borrowers facing financial trouble to stay in their homes but pave the way for thousands more to achieve the dream of becoming first time homeowners
5888283 the housing legislation will give the states housing market the shot in the arm it needs for recovery
5888284 the federal housing bill will provide stability in our economy and help boost home buyer confidence it will also help many deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure keep their homes
5888285 as home prices have adjusted to more affordable levels buyers have just the limited period of time to take advantage of these incentives
5888286 how could he do such a thing to a dying woman
5888287 they are close to us of course but also they have really taken to our sauvignon blanc
5888288 its not that the uk performed poorly at all our growth in the uk was in line with expectations it was just that australia outperformed in the past year
5888289 we are doing very well in places such as ireland we are also seeing a huge surge in asian markets consuming new zealand wine
5888290 the number of our vineyard members has grown from 407 in january 2007 to 683 members in january 2008
5888291 we are absolutely delighted with the response from the industry to the sustainability policy
5888292 i jumped a personal best oh and i qualified for the olympics
5888293 the snp always told us they had a vision for scotland they didnt tell us they were going to use photoshop to make it
5888294 after a great deal of forethought and a considerable amount of soul searching councillor katie moffat has decided
5888295 hes a guy we feel like understands the position well
5888296 he gives us some experience and some versatility thats really the first thing we saw and hes in pretty good shape
5888297 every time i saw my ob gyn during my pregnancy i asked if it was safe to be taking paxil and every time he said there were
5888298 every time i saw my ob gyn during my pregnancy i asked if it was
5888299 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5888300 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5888301 im not sure why anyone would get upset with your comments either but this post
5888302 is skeeball an olympic sport suzies last blog post a whole lot of rambling observations questions
5888303 love skeeball great job im always amazed at how little those tix will buy lisas
5888304 olympic marathon awesom cammo not the pink stuff for girls but the green and brown mostly just a
5888305 do you know that i love you very very much
5888306 ways of communication now include widespread use of the internet email and mobile phones enabling electors to live further from their elected representative yet still find it relatively easy to seek assistance when required
5888307 the end result of a careful process of adjustment is that there has been an increase in the number of electorates in the faster growing regions of the southeast necessitating a reduction in other less populous areas
5888308 all told there have been many changes to existing boundaries in all regions to enable electoral districts to meld with their neighbouring electorates
5888309 obesity is probably the largest public health problem facing our country and has the most dramatic impact on the conditions that are driving escalating health care costs
5888310 we are now at two thirds of the country overweight or obese some forecasts say that within the next decade that will be 75 percent people are not leading as healthy lives as they could
5888311 i look around my community and this obesity thing is out of control
5888312 we are just now getting more into implementation where we are seeing things happen
5888313 but we are going to see changes in some of the target behaviors before we see changes in obesity rates
5888314 the more people we have working on it the farther we get down the road
5888315 funding over the last few years has been going down for obesity efforts
5888316 if we take seriously the notion that this is a major public health crisis we need to invest more money
5888317 we live in a society that does not encourage or promote the kind of behavior that makes a difference
5888318 we have to do a better job of helping them make healthy choices
5888319 i do and will continue to love you but i will always hate that
5888320 we call it our transformation our belief system was transformed
5888321 we realized that what wed been taught all our lives was not true
5888322 we have had some mild criticism that weve been preaching to the choir but we always feel like theres a ripple effect from that
5888323 what we want to do with mary lous presence here this friday night is to awaken our own church awaken all of the christian movement and all faith traditions to see what theyre doing
5888324 the church is the biggest contributor to homophobia in our culture the price we are paying for that in the lives of gay people is just tragic and we need to stop
5888325 a lot of our ministry is to sit and listen and share love and make them know that they are a person of worth
5888326 it is kind of a broad diverse thing but it really is focused on simply telling gay people that they are a child of god just as worthy as any of us unfortunately its hard for gay people living in our culture and in the shadow of our churches to believe us
5888327 the question ive been most frequently asked is dick why do you do what youre doing
5888328 ive had a simple answer because jesus is calling me to do that love has enabled me to do it so it isnt a complicated ministry
5888329 hi ty this is phil how much did you want again
5888330 i think it builds a lot of camaraderie and a lot of unity
5888331 today was a working day we tried to to get them back going again after they had a day and half off
5888332 i think the defense is a little ahead because theyre more talented
5888333 theyre a fast talented football team on that side the nice part of it for me is our offense is going against a very good defense every day so were getting great work
5888334 our hopes would be that by the middle of the big east schedule wed get him in there he can run the option he can throw it and hes very athletic
5888335 maybe it will take a couple of games maybe a couple of bcs licks before theyre really worthy of getting in there and playing full time
5888336 i reminded brandon at the end of practice that hes started no games in his college career so hed better step up because hes getting an opportunity
5888337 hes probably got f lee bailey and a couple other people surrounding him right now and they wouldnt let me in his inner circle
5888338 hes certainly not polished but he did show pass rush ability
5888339 he showed the thing that he showed at usc which was his awareness in certain situations against certain blocking schemes crossing faces reading things
5888340 instead of being two steps away when the ball is thrown be a half a step or be hitting the quarterback
5888341 i know im a rookie i have a lot of things to catch up on
5888342 ive got to be a lot quicker in my reactions to certain things and a lot more aware on my visual keys
5888343 i come out here and its my job to get better as a football player to help the seahawks its not my job to worry about darryl or whatevers going on with that
5888344 after you guys reporters bring it up i dont even think about it anymore
5888345 they werent lying when they said its definitely 80 percent mental
5888346 youve just got to have that sharpness every day and pay attention to detail on every little thing
5888347 it has a way of humbling you as soon as you think youve got one thing going then bam you figure you dont really have it and youve got to go back to the drawing board
5888348 trying to work my technique and trying to beat walter its a pretty big deal
5888349 what can i show walter jones that he hasnt seen before
5888350 weve got to give him every opportunity to raise his level of production
5888351 and one of the best ways to do that is to get him the best competition

5888358 to come to the conclusion that i am homophobic from these sentences is far from the truth
5888359 deliberately loving pink wearing pink underwear pink socks pink shirts pink anything is wrong
5888360 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5888361 its the sort of stuff that gets said every day in the schoolyard a lot of young people are quite impressionable and when they see celebrities saying stuff like that they think its ok to say it themselves
5888362 i dont think they have maybe the right understanding of when to hit a guy how to hit a guy if youre gonna do it
5888363 the way they did it tonight just shows a lack of respect for the game and very little knowledge on their part of how to play the game
5888364 but i heard the deal was on the table for a while
5888365 i appreciate the organization for moving me if they werent going to have a significant role for me in the last year of my contract at the same time im upset they werent able to find a role for me
5888366 rabbi zushua give us a wise word before you die
5888367 when i stand before god on judgment day god will not ask me zushua why werent you more like abraham or moses

5888371 the doctor prescribed a painkiller and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5888372 in reality it wouldnt be in the best interests of the sporting community
5888373 tom initiated the grounds but a lot of other people have done a lot of work since
5888374 tom flood sports centre is probably just an easy target
5888375 on the other side we are talking about a sporting venue
5888376 a hospital is a little more important and would supersede that
5888377 the business plan is the first stage and will need to be considered carefully by the victorian government
5888378 there are many projects there which you cannot be involved in without the right environmental credentials
5888379 its something we are passionate about but we also know its a smart business move
5888380 the back half of the land is equal to national park status
5888381 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed
5888382 its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
5888383 its happened to me twice in my career believe me its disappointing
5888384 wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reasons to come back wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back for what happened this off season the only reason i came back is i wanted to play simple as that
5888385 once again in the two minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try weve put in during the weeks and really just talked about them
5888386 we never really came out and executed them and we kind of turned it loose today
5888387 we did good on a couple we didnt do quite as well on other ones the good thing is it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections i dont think were even close yet
5888388 he was pretty straightforward he would have wanted me to play all along im sure it would have been in green bay but hed probably be out here at practice every day raising hell with me what i could be doing better
5888389 he wouldve wanted me to play until my legs fell off that was just the way he was
5888390 i said theres no substitute for game like situations two minute drills red zone situations and third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5888391 with every preseason game ive played in id love to play the whole game
5888392 if im going to come out here and practice id love to play in the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it
5888393 if we can get that chemistry and play well together this team has a good chance our receiver talent here is a lot like what i played with in green bay young quick guys
5888394 each one of them offers something different than the next but we have four or five guys who can easily make big plays at any time i like it
5888395 he had just got over that and was kicking back to life again and this happens
5888396 he was a bright spark who would do anything for anybody and was a real good jovial bloke
5888397 hed come along and have his social time and barrack for the club
5888398 you want to cry in shame its an absolute tragedy
5888399 at the time he was on his own so there are no witnesses and hes suffered fairly horrific injuries
5888400 he had such severe burns to the face he had inhaled smoke and heat which causes swelling in the airways
5888401 he enjoyed his work had a keen work ethic and was a well regarded conscientious member of the team
5888402 were getting fairly close to getting clearance in terms of him getting his visa meehan said i would think by the end of the next week hell get it thats the last conversation i had with a contract at the u s embassy
5888403 looked up the translation of nikita filatovs name nikita means inconquerable filat or filatov means god guard inconquerable god guard not a bad name
5888404 he fights with zero defense and welcomes punches to his face with a big smile his warrior spirit is reminiscent to that of his deceased indian warrior heroes crazy horse sitting bull and geronimo

5888407 we are looking into providing a dedicated area for dogs to run off leads mr hands said
5888408 this area provides a social connection for other dog owners
5888409 the first step is to find a preferred site and then consider our options mr hands said
5888410 most sporting grounds support off leash areas but after speaking with some groups of people the need for an area for dogs off leads to socialise and be safe was identified
5888411 its such an important part of peoples lives we are always trying to promote exercise and healthy lifestyles cr jones said
5888412 theres been strong recommendation for a dog park and council is looking at that
5888413 its evident we need somewhere for them dogs to go off lead its important for them ms wingrave said
5888414 im pleased the council is realising the fact there is strong community support for this its certainly very encouraging ms wingrave said
5888415 at the same time im disappointed at the denial of off leash shared access to strathdale park as in this area we are short of dog exercise spaces she said
5888416 it has been a policy of the city to fund a part of these costs with bonds in order to avoid higher interest rates
5888417 bendigo bank is always looking for ways to get involved with the community and the otis foundation is bendigo initiated
5888418 its an exciting new way for us to raise funds for the otis foundation
5888419 it doesnt cost anyone anything the otis foundation gets a percentage of the profits
5888420 because the foundation is a free service were continually looking to raise money
5888421 i encourage all our fabulous supporters to help spread the message about the community enterprise and encourage their family friends and workmates to get behind this exciting project
5888422 the man was conveyed to bendigo hospital suffering major leg fractures and significant blood loss she said
5888423 motorists need to be vigilant and take the time to have a good look at give way signs he said
5888424 too many people are looking at stop signs like give way signs and drivers really just need to be more careful he said
5888425 when brown needs defense down low he can go to anderson varejao
5888426 not too many mexicans get the chance to do that

5888457 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year the company said
5888458 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe chief executive louis gries said
5888459 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5888460 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share

5888489 truth is there are very few people being healed in lakeland i have worked with charisma magazine editor lee grady in discovering how many false reports have been released as facts these are our brothers and sisters involved in this but this move of god has been a move of men with god still touching some who come to seek him
5888490 charisma reporters and a few others like myself have tried to get these verified and cannot
5888491 friday night todd said that god said there were 1000 people that were to give 1000 and they were to receive a 1000 fold blessing the one hour drama on this giving subject was so deceptively evident that it was embarrasing to watch on top of that those that would give that money were able to come to the platform to be recognized
5888492 peter wagner and chuck pierce nominated me as a marketplace apostle 6 years ago
5888493 after this year we will pray about next year and so far it looks like the father is giving us a sense that we may not to be a part of the ica if peter and the leadership do not reconsider their impromptu decision to jump into the lakeland stream when many of us warned him not to
5888494 i am praying for todd because he really is an evangelist and he is a gifted evangelist
5888495 the biggest thing about lakeland is the lack of the fear of our awesome god lack of repentance and humility many have exchanged the truth for a lie and chosen experience over content angels trances and 3rd heaven focus has replaced the gospel as a focus lord do what only you can do to bring your divine alignment to all of us in jesus name
5888496 to answer your question yes there is at least a dozen ica members that i know of that are extremely concerned at peters endorsement and more to follow as the nonsense continues
5888497 it is my opinion that it was man orchestrated and demonically influenced from the very beginning
5888498 we have heard a few people getting well being touched and so on
5888499 god is about nameless and faceless people who are operating without any agenda but the lords preaching about the king and his kingdom and moving supernaturally after him and as they do signs and wonders follow the problem in charismania is that they seek the sign they seek the thrill they seek the craft supply quality gold dust feathers and gems they may get the chills and frills but leave with nothing more than goose bumps and really little spiritual change when they seek the king the kingdom of god and his righteousness you begin to see transformation take place at the heart level this is gods way and always has been bentley is just a product of the charismatic apostolic prophetic trending away from plumb line truth at the same time the fact is none of us amount to much no not one but in him and dying to self and living his agenda we can move mountains the church is getting there i wrote an article for charisma that everything that can be shaken is being shaken and this is what is happening in a great way right now
5888500 hi staff we need to talk probably as a staff and go through what ive found out
5888501 the reports he has given me are firsthand not hearsay
5888502 on the financial front todd recently told the crowd that god had told him that there were 1 000 people who would give 1 000 and that they would be blessed 1 000 fold
5888503 what i am saying is that we need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland and that we need to stop repeating claims being made on the air lest we end up getting splattered with the collateral damage when certain issues of false claims embellishments and lapses of integrity begin to come out more publicly by the way no one is saying that some healings have not happened only that many false embellished or unsubstantiated claims have been made a number of really good men champions of revival through the years are actually saying that the whole thing is of the devil and that even the healings are demonically inspired i want to be clear that im not going there
5888504 need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland
5888505 as a member of ica peter wagner actually caused many questions to come my way because of my membership there i will no longer be involved with that organization and actually have not tracked well with them and some of their agendas since i have been involved with them however i have enjoyed the many relationships i have developed from going to the annual meetings most all of those relationships are also disengaging from their affiliation with ica because of many issues beyond lakeland
5888506 the ica leadership continues to adopt belief systems without seeking the advice and counsel of members
5888507 i think that there is a chance that many may disassociate with the ica depending on todd continuing to reveal his deceptive doctrine and peter continuing to support such doctrine
5888508 e il momento disperato in cui si scopre che questimpero che ci era sembrato la somma di tutte le meraviglie uno sfacelo senza fine n forma che la sua corruzione troppo incancrenita perch il nostro scettro possa mettevi riparo che il trionfo sui sovrani avversari ci ha fatto eredi della loro lunga rovina

5888522 if we tell them tonight there will not be one
5888523 some leaders say the controversial lakeland revival is forcing us to choose sides
5888524 its been more than 10 years since charismatic prophet rick joyner predicted in his popular book the final quest that believers would experience a civil war in the church
5888525 other charismatic leaders have echoed this theme since joyners book was published in 1996
5888526 even in early 2008 before the lakeland revival erupted in florida in april some charismatic prophets were declaring that a great rift would divide those who believe in
5888527 ill admit i was not paying too much attention to these civil war predictions 10 years ago
5888528 i became the bad guy because by asking questions i was relying on my intellect
5888529 but now i realize that some people really want a war
5888530 i cant even describe how much this hurts because i love people on both sides of this conflict
5888531 i want to plead with everyone in our movement to reconsider the whole civil war scenario
5888532 please pray for bentley and for the leaders who are speaking into his life during this season and pray that the church will not only experience genuine spiritual revival but also true unity lets work out our differences support one anothers ministries and focus all our efforts on one common goal to tell a lost world about the love of jesus

5888546 what if we would have been asleep i wonder if we would have woke up
5888547 the best place for smoke detectors would have been outside the sleeping area and inside the sleeping area and one in the basement as well
5888548 mainly due to the reason more people work different shifts a lot more people are on certain medications that make them sleep better they might not hear one outside the hallway

5888551 when was the last time you watched 10 000 movies you know i dont care how many movies are available to me as my personal taste as a customer i want to watch the new stuff so whether we have 10 000 movies or 200 movies it doesnt matter if i dont want to see any of the movies that we have
5888552 is heavily weighted toward newer releases and mainstream staple titles
5888553 this is a particularly pleasing result given the increasingly challenging economic environment in many markets and it confirms the strength of our business models
5888554 we continue to win significant new business in both existing and new markets and we have made excellent early progress in the implementation of our growth strategy
5888555 our performance makes me optimistic about the medium to longer term growth outlook for brambles

5888557 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5888558 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5888559 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5888560 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5888561 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5888562 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5888563 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5888564 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5888565 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward

5888567 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them
5888568 what he has done is chicken out of that and i dont think that the leaders across the region will respond to that positively
5888569 the challenge for pacific countries is to have a united front on the question of fiji and to apply maximum political and diplomatic leverage on bainimaramas regime
5888570 i use the word regime because its not a democratically elected government and were not accustomed not to have democratically elected governments
5888571 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
5888572 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
5888573 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
5888574 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
5888575 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
5888576 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5888577 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5888578 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
5888579 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that

5888581 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5888582 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
5888583 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5888584 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5888585 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5888586 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5888587 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5888588 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines

5888593 honestly those last two losses really came down to the focus that i had in those fights my mindset for other fights i wasnt in there just to win
5888594 i was in there to really try to be my best to prove im the best and to always improve and come out a better fighter
5888595 for my last two fights i was basically trying to coast i was trying to get in shape for the fights but i wasnt in there to really become a better fighter so thats really what i brought back to my focus my motivation
5888596 im still with dream i still have one more fight on the contract
5888597 negotiations are underway right now for a new one ill know pretty soon whats going to happen but you will see me fight in dream at least one more time
5888598 we are in negotiations and who knows how the negotiations can go if they go well in japan then youll see me fight in japan if not it will be somewhere else
5888599 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5888600 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5888601 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
5888602 more importantly i got to see my new niece who was born this past weekend its always great to welcome someone so new and so adorably cute to the family ive never really found newborn babies to be cute just because they dont really do anything and are usually a delicate little ball of wrinkled skin when theyre born babies are cute when theyre 1 or 2 months old however this niece was really cute already which was great i look forward to her becoming even cuter over the next many months
5888603 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5888604 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth where he thinks hes above the law
5888605 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5888606 is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5888607 what we need to do is stabilise this business and we need to see its scale
5888608 at the moment were on a run rate of doing 25 million to 26 million for the year in terms of revenue but for this to become a 50 million to 100 million business we need to invest
5888609 davin joseph has hurt his foot hes getting x rays and examinations and all those things at this point in time but i dont have anything concrete in terms of what the injury is
5888610 hes not a 100 percent and therefore its hard to play but he is back in a limited capacity
5888611 there are a lot of people questioning if youre going to come back and how youll come back
5888612 you came into this league hungrier than heck and led your team to a championship and now people think youve fallen off with your injuries
5888613 if i was you id be really upset about that id come in with a chip on my shoulder
5888614 i was written off in one year quicker than anybody had ever been
5888615 being injured it was like i had forgotten how to play basketball but it made me hungry and it put me back in the position where ive always been and thats the underdog
5888616 he hasnt just come back at the level he was
5888617 you need things to push you and i found them
5888618 there are always things that are going to push you
5888619 you end up working with a lot of guys who think they know everything but he doesnt ever go halfway hes a perfectionist
5888620 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5888621 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5888622 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
5888623 republicans know that government appropriations are inherently less productive than private spending taxes have become more and more burdensome over the years
5888624 democrats know that state government spending has been reduced drastically there is no practical way of improving public services without spending more
5888625 academic research has established that every claim in each of the previous two paragraphs is false
5888626 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
5888627 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

5888634 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5888635 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5888636 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5888637 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless

5888639 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5888640 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5888641 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5888642 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
5888643 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5888644 has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5888645 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5888646 he did well at right tackle and then we put him in at guard and he actually did better at guard
5888647 hes kind of a big body guy who just seems to bend just right and when people run into him they dont tend to get very far
5888648 the guy has a chance to be a pretty good starter for us
5888649 is a big loss for us he was a veteran on the offensive line
5888650 they really want me to use my quickness and strength on that side
5888651 but you never know what will happen at a grand slam every player is good everyone wants to win i will be happy if i am in the second week or in the quarter finals or something for now i just have to enjoy this moment
5888652 when i played roger federer he was intimidating me a lot
5888653 rafa nadal too novak djokovic these players are one step up but now maybe i can do good matches against them or maybe other players will feel the same when i am playing with them because i am winning a lot of tournaments
5888654 i dont know if i play my game i have chances against every player
5888655 with my serve and my forehand it is better to play on hard courts
5888656 i like playing on clay because i started playing tennis on clay courts i know how to do it but if i want to be a good player i want to be able to play on a harder surface
5888657 if i could choose one grand slam title to win it would be the u s open its on hard courts and i like new york manhattan i like the atmosphere
5888658 it is one of my dreams wimbledon has the history and i loved it this year but i just love the u s open
5888659 you know lionel messi the barcelona and argentina striker i played like him
5888660 the results are not obviously satisfactory to the state we want to see higher student achievement overall
5888661 lolz im gonna make a joke about living with his mom and question his car knowledge cus i cant carry out a reasonable debate about the actual topic at hand
5888662 success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm
5888663 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5888664 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5888665 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5888666 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5888667 shouldnt we go back im sure there shouldve been a trail back there
5888668 i said let me handle it i know what im doing
5888669 well why dont we yell to see if the others hear us
5888670 but there has to be a path back there somewhere
5888671 what do i want i want to get to where were going
5888672 you never know well have to tell the others about it
5888673 im sure theres lots of weird trees out here they wouldnt want to hear about it
5888674 well its the first like it that ive seen and you sure seemed interested in it
5888675 no jack youre not what are you doing out here
5888676 new healthcare crisis on horizon thousands of doctors and nurses face unemployment
5888677 i talked to my doctor and he said i tore some ligaments or something
5888678 its something where he still has to wear a cast because of a bruise
5888679 we think by the time we get to the season opener that it will be a non issue
5888680 the problem is hes got to wear that cast throughout all these practices and probably will still have to have it on this week
5888681 its hard to tackle its hard to be a corner with a cast on but its the situation that it is and well make the best of it
5888682 theres nothing telling us that theres going to be surgery
5888683 everything tells us that hes going to be ok for the opener we think that it will be over by then
5888684 plain and simple he threw a perfect ball the first game i turned my hands the wrong way and dropped it the second game misjudged it and took a dive you watch it on film i misjudged it when i dove it hit my fingertips and popped off its one of those things
5888685 i think we have a perimeter group that catches the ball very well illustrated by what we have done in the past but that doesnt carry over obviously to the present
5888686 we work on it every day im not concerned as we move forward but we need to catch the ball better
5888687 but we have to do it anyway im the first one to criticize myself and after that game the first thing i said was i shouldve caught that deep ball would it have changed the game it was the first quarter but it would have made a big play for us those two plays i shouldve made but ive always come back to make another one
5888688 you dont want to see it because it obviously doesnt help the offense when it happens and it might kill a drive and so forth
5888689 but with a guy like donald who catches the ball so consistently has such good hands its not a concern
5888690 but its one of those things you can always work out
5888691 he just wants to win and whoevers at quarterback hes going to be the pro bowl performer that he is and always has been
5888692 its certainly easy to understand the relationship and the connection he had with brett but i think you can see that same level of confidence and production with he and aaron
5888693 i think friday night is more important because we get to play a little bit more
5888694 and we want to establish some momentum going into the season because you know that last game of the preseason were not going to play as much we know that we never have and we never will this is the big test to see how were going to get on the same page and start rolling
5888695 im definitely a young guy with a lot of experience i have to get under my belt but im up to the challenge
5888696 there were some effort plays that bothered us that he needs to clean up there was a third down shallow cross where he lost his guy across the field hes now put a couple of weeks of practice under his belt and well give him plenty of snaps and also as a returner
5888697 we did a great job of coming together developing chemistry and we certainly changed that around so i dont see why we cant do that here
5888698 the coaches may want to mix up the rotation no matter what unit youre on you always have the potential to move up just as you have the potential to move down
5888699 every day is a job interview this may be my opportunity to move up or move down but i definitely believe that once i get my opportunity im going to take advantage of it
5888700 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5888701 it is a fallacy to say there is a limit to tax rates and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5888702 everybody is a perfect person there are no 2 people alike that youll meet in your lifetime
5888703 they remember that day 10 years ago when they made it to work in seven minutes flat that becomes their standard
5888704 why are people so bitter and jealous and being so horrible to me
5888705 through the night they heard bombs bursting and saw the red glare of rockets
5888706 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
5888707 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
5888708 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
5888709 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5888710 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
5888711 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
5888712 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
5888713 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
5888714 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well
5888715 ms maddow will almost certainly be a closer ideological fit with mr olbermann s
5888716 the horse is very powerful and special and he fits with stronger music
5888717 if the horse likes the music we made for the horses then they can dance
5888718 i felt that he rose with the music and he likes to listen to the music
5888719 hes a little bit of a latino guy you know
5888720 its fitting to his way of moving hes very powerful in his moving and has a lot of knee action
5888721 rangers are a huge club i think it is a great story for him and shows kids that they should keep following their dream
5888722 he is one of the strongest people i know if you look at how he handled being in the national team and being mls rookie of the year he is strong mentally and i am sure he will handle this
5888723 you cant hold these young kids back they have to graduate to the next level its a big loss for us but i could see it coming over the last few weeks
5888724 but they watched him leading up to the olympics and at the olympics and made another bid
5888725 the deal is pending as mo needs to get a work permit but he is looking forward to his new challenge and were looking forward to moving on
5888726 the mls gets 33 percent of the 5 million and 66 percent comes to our club which we can utilize in many ways for the development of the soccer club
5888727 theres another player leaving the club and another player coming in
5888728 i think the player coming in will help us immensely
5888729 white men imposed quotas on us and now were going to do the same to them
5888730 whites bused blacks to enforce segregation and now they deserve to get a taste of their own medicine
5888731 seize any opportunity or anything that looks like opportunity they are rare much rarer than you think
5888732 many people do not realize they are getting a lucky break in life when they get it if a big publisher or a big art dealer or a movie executive or a hotshot banker or a big thinker suggests an appointment cancel anything you have planned you may not see such a window open up again
5888733 take paid time off for holidays travel and rest when they want without asking permission just letting managers know as a courtesy
5888734 early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
5888735 put no trust in the benefits to accrue from early rising as set forth by the infatuated franklin
5888736 i want him to make me a better quarterback a better player and a better team leader
5888737 thats one of the greatest things you can do as a young player and earn your respect
5888738 i want to tell him i cant wait to come and learn from him
5888739 that was one of the pluses we had going for us is that we had a senior quarterback coming back that terrelle thought he could learn from
5888740 if there are some things that terrelle demonstrates that hes going to add to the package that maybe are not todds strong suits then maybe you find that mixture of everyones strengths
5888741 i think thats why a lot of people will put a huge emphasis on the usc game to try to give ohio state credibility
5888742 you dont want to feel like you felt the last two years
5888743 im starting to drive the ball better and my putting is coming around so im looking forward to a good stretch here in the playoffs
5888744 my game is pretty much the same just the scoring at times isnt as good but every tournament were playing in if you shoot par youve played a heck of a round its been a tough stretch of tough golf
5888745 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5888746 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5888747 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5888748 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5888749 here are the services logan qualifies for as a child with disabilities
5888750 we were on cell phones and as soon as we reached 2 861 we targeted a fan at gate h
5888751 the 50 000 is great and getting the two season tickets is amazing
5888752 my buddy bought my ticket i was going to switch tickets with him in line

5888754 from all the salesmen looking a pr0n during their off hours
5888755 im waiting a few hours at the thompson toyota my prius is getting some minor work done to it to pass state inspection it still takes a few hours they have a wireless connection to the internet but even though last time i connected without problems this time my pii debian system was not happy so i checked out the bank of beat up gateways with vagabond keyboards in the corner i wiggle the mouse and up pops the ubuntu heron wow i can tell from the scribbled out tag that these are likely hand me downs from thompson lexus i bet them bastards over there now have vista i expect that they just didnt want to pay for licenses but i can do some work the neat part is that other people are actually using them by default there are no icons on the desktop so some people cant find firefox right away but they find it the card games seem most popular thought at least today i guess ubuntu really is a user friendly system
5888756 85 of the worlds most powerful super computers run linux

5888758 he was to western shirts what henry ford was to cars
5888759 the first thing i did was get rid of the farmer
5888760 cowboys have a strong independent identity and want to be different i offered them a special fashion statement to make them stand apart from city slickers when they come to town
5888761 the west is not a place it is a state of mind
5888762 he remained vital until the end when he got into his 90s he seemed like he was 60
5888763 love your job if you dont change jobs because nothings worse than the drudgery of a job you dont like
5888764 for him his work was his second romance next to his marriage
5888765 a bit of jack daniels once or twice a week to keep his blood thin
5888766 sure theres some intangible value to being the first kid on the block to have that new toy
5888767 but and i cant think of a single product where this isnt true the first generation is bound to be buggy plus you have to realize that the price is going to drop eventually
5888768 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5888769 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5888770 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5888771 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5888772 overkill takes you back to when special agent g was fresh out of the academy
5888773 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5888774 this study speaks to the value of knowing genomic sequence instead of relying on a patients appearance or self identified ethnicity
5888775 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have show cased
5888776 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming
5888777 it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
5888778 you can literally come to berea with nothing but what you can carry and graduate debt free

5888785 a coordinated assault by at least 10 suicide bombers against one of the largest american military bases in the country
5888786 the attacks were part of a sharp escalation in fighting as insurgents have seized a window of opportunity to press their campaign this summer taking advantage of a wavering nato commitment an outgoing american administration a
5888787 ten people were killed during several attacks targeting coalition troops and iraqi police in the past 24 hours
5888788 al qaeda kurdish and leftist fighters have all carried out bomb attacks in turkey in the past
5888789 floating down the sound resounds around the icy waters underground
5888790 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life
5888791 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5888792 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5888793 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5888794 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5888795 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5888796 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5888797 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5888798 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5888799 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5888800 all forms of measures and sanctions against zimbabwe must be lifted in order to facilitate a sustainable solution to the challenges that are currently facing zimbabwe
5888801 the parties reaffirm the principle of the united nations charter on non interference in the internal affairs of member countries
5888802 the parties hereby agree that the responsibility of effecting change of government in zimbabwe vests exclusively in and is the sole prerogative of the people of zimbabwe through peaceful democratic and constitutional means
5888803 reject any unlawful violent undemocratic and unconstitutional means of changing governments
5888804 no outsiders have a right to call or campaign for regime change in zimbabwe
5888805 upon the united kingdom government to accept primary responsibility to pay compensation for land acquired from land owners for resettlement
5888806 we call upon governments that are hosting and or funding external radio stations broadcasting into zimbabwe to cease such hosting and funding
5888807 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
5888808 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
5888809 without further delay we are demanding that ngos be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance distributing food medicines and life saving assistance this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
5888810 the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis requires the immediate and unconditional lifting of the suspension on all ngo field operations harassment of ngos must cease immediately and protection for humanitarian workers must be guaranteed timing is critical steps must be taken now in order for food to be available to those in need in future months
5888811 its a great deal and its something weve been chasing after for a while
5888812 on selected routes we can add some coaches to a train on other ones were already maxed out
5888813 whether its older ladies or middle aged women or young girls the show reached a lot of people
5888814 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
5888815 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
5888816 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
5888817 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
5888818 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
5888819 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
5888820 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5888821 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pre game talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5888822 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
5888823 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practise and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow
5888824 clearly ian paisley jnr hasnt learnt anything from the history of the last 40 years
5888825 this is the type of corner boy approach to politics we have come to expect from paisley g
5888826 what unionist leaders and in particular the dup need to demonstrate is theyre prepared to share power with nationalists and republicans on the basis of equality rather than appealing to lowest common denominator
5888827 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5888828 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5888829 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
5888830 there are some crumbs of comfort that the weapons deployment has been botched or else more likely dissidents have been infiltrated and at the last moment the explosives undermined and therefore lives saved
5888831 however we cannot always rely upon infiltration and treachery within the ranks of the dissidents to undermine their activity
5888832 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of the ratepayers until that amount is collected
5888833 i believe that it is important to show our support for our men and women in uniform who are serving in harms way
5888834 i had the opportunity to lead this congressional delegation to iraq pakistan and afghanistan to gain more insight about the current situation in the middle east we also were able to meet with our servicemen and women from guam including the guam national guards alpha company i told them that the people of guam as well as our nation support them we are very proud of their dedication and professionalism and we hope that they can return home soon i also brought them gifts from home including guguria donn and mementos we had a very special visit with members of alpha company in afghanistan who recently lost two of their soldiers i told them we share their loss and we are praying for their safe return
5888835 those 2 projects have gone a long way the one thats finished and the one thats almost finished in to reducing our dependency on navy water along with leak detection and the rest
5888836 dont even get me started on 360 and their supposed
5888837 11 out of those 24 are exclusives and titles such as folklore and hsg is missing from the list the ps3 doesnt have enough good exclusives argument is crap as well
5888838 when people say the ps3 doesnt have any good games they usually mean any good exclusive titles gtaiv orange box oblivion assasins creed rock band bad company skate and many others are for the 360 in addition to the ps3
5888839 if youve got a ps3 you should get these games
5888840 picking between the ps3 and 360 versions of rock band is pretty much a toss up
5888841 well its good for getting rid of nazis trying to steal your ark
5888842 here are the 24 titles that every playstation 3 owner should have in their collection
5888843 more developers are inclined to produce more exclusive dlc gta4 in exchange for a bigger share of the profits
5888844 desde hace dos d as los cpc se dieron a la tarea de instalar mantas en las calles y avenidas con mensajes ofensivos que llaman a la violencia en contra del mrs las maniobras de los cpc y del frente sandinista era crear choques entre ambos grupos y por esa raz n decidimos suspender la actividad programada para este lunes
5888845 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5888846 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5888847 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5888848 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5888849 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless

5888861 this is tougher for me as i have been through four rounds of the 100m and this is the first time ive had to do eight rounds in a championships
5888862 im feeling it but i feel like ive got one run left in me
5888863 small on size and big on potential the best of 45nm technology is used to deliver a rich and full experience in a tiny power packed package
5888864 nettops represent a fundamental shift in system design and pc consumption over the next 20 years we will see nettops emerge as a powerful and significant force in computing
5888865 we believe that we are in great shape to remain on top of this segment for some time with our leading architecture and engineering strategy
5888866 we are up against a worthy competitor and we will remain cautious to put a specific date on the how long
5888867 i wouldnt be as bold or disparaging as to make the sort of claims that our competitor made about us prior to the launch of rv770 4800 series which has seen us gain considerable share and has caused it some embarrassment
5888868 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5888869 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5888870 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5888871 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5888872 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5888873 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5888874 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5888875 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
5888876 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5888877 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5888878 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centered on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency

5888890 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5888891 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5888892 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5888893 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5888894 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5888895 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5888896 a number of guys have received interest from nfl teams which is a part of having great players and winning a championship

5888898 whether its older ladies or middle aged women or young girls the show reached a lot of people
5888899 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
5888900 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
5888901 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
5888902 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
5888903 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
5888904 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle dbrickashaw ferguson was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
5888905 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5888906 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pre game talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5888907 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
5888908 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practise and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow

5888911 brian j noggle apparently forgot that the proper design for a tin foil beanie calls for the shiny side out
5888912 im weeping openly right now thanks for hurting my feelings pinhead
5888913 the more i get to play characters that are glamorous the less pressure i feel to do it in my own life
5888914 when you never get dressed up sometimes you think oh i really should pull it together when its your job to look like that you think ill just wear jeans and the most awesome rock star t shirt i can find if anything its liberated my inner couch potato
5888915 there are lots of form fitting dresses with truly beautiful lines theres more of a focus on ankles calves and collarbones as opposed to cleavage butts and things like that i had really nice clothes oscar de la renta chanel
5888916 jewish holidays dont coincide with ramadan this year so even if palestine gets the coke cans with the crescents the company is not likely to feel obligated to make coke cans with a shofar the rams horn blown on the jewish new year or with a picture of a succa or a palm branch and citron for the holiday of succoth for israel
5888917 the campaign has paid the expenses based on longstanding regulations
5888918 the white house has a formula that has been in place since reagan that has been adhered to by ronald reagan george h w bush bill clinton and george w bush
5888919 but tim bee is acting like a typical politician and abusing their services to pay for his political campaign bees campaign has bragged about raising a half million dollars during his bush fundraiser the president was clearly here for a private event yet the public got stuck with the tab this is inexcusable behavior by someone who wants a say in determining how federal taxpayer dollars are spent
5888920 obviously well comment from a partisan point of view we will have a press conference and otherwise be available to the media to comment from our perspective
5888921 since 9 11 people in general are not waiting to realize certain dreams
5888922 people in their 40s and 50s are motivated to try something new because they realize they dont have unlimited time
5888923 i thought id better take that leap of faith now
5888924 after having done so many things youre able to use everything youve learned
5888925 most of the bosses i saw who failed did so because they became more obsessed with company politics
5888926 get coaching from other people including your attorney to cover your bases
5888927 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5888928 so now youre left denying the truth and its hitting in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
5888929 if you think holding hands is all in the fingers grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers
5888930 if you think that a kiss is all in the lips come on youve got it all wrong
5888931 the funny thing is he really thinks hes getting the best part of this but im getting the treat the blessing to be around him it just reminds you of how blessed we are hes so special i gave him a bat in pittsburgh and we became very friendly and he said he wanted to come here i said why doesnt he come to my apartment and come to the park with me
5888932 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5888933 thats the best we can do and then of course get these two trees that are certainly very threatening to out two garages and our home
5888934 my guys have been working around the clock to at least get things on the ground in case we do have some good winds
5888935 were offering 10 bags per household to anybody that needs them that lives in low lying areas
5888936 other people may not be as worried it may just be a tropical storm
5888937 it may not get as much as we need to worry about but im concerned
5888938 h es been great in terms of our conversations and with the team and with the guys
5888939 now we may see fay here and this is not the first time this has happened to us we got wilma in miami when we had evacuated from the keys
5888940 top casino group for 2005 in the gambling online magazine readers poll awards fortune lounge confirmed their position as leaders in the online gaming industry
5888941 they found a loophole in the video poker law to reintroduce this similar type of gaming
5888942 we get an awful lot of complaints from the public as far as my father my spouse theyre taking their entire retirement cheque and spending it in location a on these poker machines
5888943 comcasts high speed internet connects wii owners with their friends all over the world
5888944 this is really an economic generator in terms of creating more business and creating people coming into the area
5888945 and when you have a resort like this and you have a resort nearby theres certainly a synergy of people that are tourists to the area that want to see both and i think that thats occurred
5888946 believe its helped our sales and the way that its hurt i think we have lost some restaurant business
5888947 donations from the pokagon fund have included the city of new buffalo and new buffalo township for improvements to public parks borgess lee memorial hospital for the expansion and rebuilding of its emergency facilities and the hartford community center for support of an after school tutoring program these are only a few of the nearly 70 projects funded to date

5888950 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5888951 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5888952 if present government does not bring musharraf in the court any one could misuse powers like him musharraf and ruin the national institutions in future
5888953 he misused his powers and destroyed several national institutions how could the nation provide him safe passage
5888954 in a day the value of rupee increased as compared to dollar which is a positive sign for our economy
5888955 pakistanis are now recognised in the world as terrorists only because of musharraf
5888956 it basically allows people struggling with a mental health illness in their child or adolescent a resource where they can try to figure out where do i turn what do i do now
5888957 at the best of times people dont know those answers
5888958 kamloops is no exception its going to be really helpful its going to prevent a lot of suffering
5888959 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5888960 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5888961 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5888962 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5888963 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5888964 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5888965 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5888966 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5888967 we really want to get the message out to people
5888968 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5888969 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
5888970 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5888971 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5888972 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5888973 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5888974 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5888975 as there are no direct flights to london hes boasted he may just disappear into asia and start his life afresh
5888976 i said all along they deserved it the way they played throughout the playoffs i give them a lot of credit but thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
5888977 its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back the only reason i came back is because i wanted to play
5888978 i have no idea id like to have the opportunity to make that decision
5888979 i told him he should take as much time as he wants
5888980 youve been in the nfl 17 years youve earned that right
5888981 hed have wanted me to play all along and im sure it would have been in green bay
5888982 but he probably would be out here in practice every day raising hell telling me what i could be doing better hed have wanted me to play until my legs fell off thats just the way he was
5888983 now more than ever live sports like football continue to be something that advertisers recognize break through
5888984 we worked with the nfl to orchestrate the jets at the chargers
5888985 its the biggest game of week 1 that i can ever remember
5888986 you wouldnt ever know that the new york giants existed and theyre the super bowl champions
5888987 now more than ever live sports like football continue to be something that advertisers recognize break through
5888988 we worked with the nfl to orchestrate the jets at the chargers
5888989 its the biggest game of week 1 that i can ever remember
5888990 you wouldnt ever know that the new york giants existed and theyre the super bowl champions
5888991 it might be inconvenient to interrupt our profound discussion and change the subject slightly but i would like to know whether extraneous abstract thoughts ever enter your head while playing a game
5888992 oh what a difficult job it was to drag out of the marsh the hippopotamus
5888993 and the following day it was with pleasure that i read in the paper how mikhail tal after carefully thinking over the position for 40 minutes made an accurately calculated piece sacrifice
5888994 practitioners can now go beyond therapy on the basis of ethnicity into the precisely targeted arena of personal genomics
5888995 its already mutating the animals the pollution that theyre causing we need to do something quickly
5888996 for me personally it does piss me off you know knowing that its not under my control right now its the government of canada that has the control over it they have monopoly over our land but industry somehow they got the licence to pollute
5888997 were going to make changes by unity of the people
5888998 were going to come out with one message protect the environment and the water at all costs
5888999 using a really conservative estimate using the largest possible size of shark using a low fin to weight ratio thats still 10 000 sharks that would have needed to be killed for that amount of fin
5889000 start protecting places like osprey reef out in the coral sea one of the few places in the world where sharks come in large numbers they aggregate there
5889001 another key action that were calling for is that we want the queensland government to shelve its plans for creating a shark fishery literally in the great barrier reef world heritage area
5889002 currently theres around 1 400 licences that can be utilised to take shark in queensland waters the proposal is to reduce that to 200 licences and restrict the catch to a precautionary level of 700 tonnes
5889003 i want to be absolutely convinced on the basis of the material that comes to me that we can agree with the queensland government on a management plan that sees fisheries managed sustainably and which doesnt see impacts on fish species and an impact that has been reflected in the figures that have been released today
5889004 there was a whole change right through the ecosystem and the scallop fishery collapsed because with the loss of the sharks the rays increased dramatically and they ate all the scallops and so the fishery collapsed because of the fishery for sharks so you lost two fisheries
5889005 for me it isnt about breaking other peoples records im not interested in the limelight
5889006 i just like catching fish and getting better at it i like improving on my own achievements
5889007 it might take me years but i want to get something really big like 130lbs in my net mrs street was on a nine day trip to the lake with her husband chris a 39 year old driver when she struck lucky
5889008 i shot out the bivvy and knew id caught something big straight away because of the way the rod was angled
5889009 i was half asleep and the fish was putting up a really big fight it had swum into the reeds further down the lake
5889010 i just kept going and going at it until id reeled it in that took about 50 minutes alone
5889011 then i had to wade out into deep water put my hand in its mouth and pull it in i was shouting let me do it and i managed to scoop it into the net on my own
5889012 to get it on the bank all in all took about an hour
5889013 our position is really that it shouldnt be placed anywhere on the mainland
5889014 if anywhere it should be kept on plum island and the hundreds of billions of dollars that would go into building a facility here should be used to update the facility on plum island
5889015 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5889016 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5889017 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5889018 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5889019 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5889020 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5889021 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5889022 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5889023 we know specifically where a tagged salmon has been and when and that helps us fill in a big gap
5889024 the news is encouraging in 2008 more than 2 000 adult salmon returned to the penobscot river to spawn the highest annual total in more than 20 years research like this ultrasonic tagging project will help us understand why and perhaps then managers can work to actively improve atlantic salmon marine survival
5889025 as it runs out of body reserves it may beach itself or simply slip away from us in shallow water
5889026 as that happens it does become a little bit susceptible to predators
5889027 ive been sailing back from port stephens and came in late last night and woke up this morning to a strange sucking sound at the bottom of the boat
5889028 it sounds quite pathetic like someone with a great vacuum cleaner trying to suck the bottom of the boat
5889029 i just didnt want to start the boat or do anything to hurt the whale
5889030 if it was smaller perhaps but this is too big and too specialised in its nutritional needs
5889031 its absolutely the case that we havent given up on this little whale
5889032 if you start thinking about what are the chances of you getting cut you go out there and make mistakes and look bad
5889033 you cant do that you just have to keep working and do the best you can
5889034 but i like the team that im on now and im just trying to be here when the 53 comes around
5889035 i used to do it in high school so im kind of familiar with it
5889036 i think i showed that they can put me in i know the protections im going to run hard no matter what
5889037 put me on special teams im going to go out and do the best that i can and im a fighter
5889038 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
5889039 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5889040 once we were working it felt like a good fit
5889041 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5889042 it is not out of the question for smith to put up excellent numbers this year

5889044 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5889045 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5889046 its smart for one of the major parties to plant its flag in a region that is trending rapidly toward swing status
5889047 it will be a few elections before it the region rivals ohio and florida as a presidential battleground
5889048 but it is a place with a new vital economy its a place where the nation needs to build new infrastructure a place of great social mobility and to where tremendous numbers of new residents are being attracted to the possibility of a middle class life
5889049 weve always known that youve got to grow the battleground state map and when you look at some of the recent senate races in the west and the transition from republican governorships to more democratic governorships youre starting to see a transition
5889050 if you just look at the electoral map from 04 to the present if obama can pick up a red state he can win colorado is one of those that can flip it really is in play
5889051 they democrats want to make a statement about going after the west and that they intend to be competitive there
5889052 i personally dont think it matters though where a party holds its convention i think its a worthless symbolic gesture
5889053 but youve got to have it the partys convention somewhere
5889054 i want you to win almost as much as i want to beat this cancer
5889055 ill run if you fight hard to beat the cancer
5889056 the answer is not throwing money at the problem the answer is throwing good qualified people at the problem
5889057 its an amazing opportunity for us you dont get all these people in one place but every four years
5889058 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5889059 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5889060 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5889061 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5889062 all you are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed
5889063 intersections emerging commonly accepted and best practices in higher education it
5889064 the fairmont scottsdale is committed to being good stewards of the environment and its pretty amazing to think that our kitchen grease can be used to help power school buses and other vehicles
5889065 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5889066 theres nothing on our risk list that i would term a showstopper or major issue that we cant deal with
5889067 this is great getting a regular cable show is something ive wanted
5889068 this is too easy theyre running like slimebait from a speelfox

5889072 adkisson targeted the church still wrote in the document obtained by wbir tv channel 10 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
5889073 adkisson told still that he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
5889074 adkisson told officers he left the house unlocked for them because he expected to be killed during the assault
5889075 now the kicker in the military commissions act mccain acquiesced to the use of these techniques against terror suspects by the cia and so the tortured became the enabler of torture someone somewhere cried out in pain for the same reasons mccain once did and mccain let it continue

5889141 but in terms of discussions today there is no doubt there are significant moves where our governments are moving in a similar direction
5889142 consumers need real protections against unscrupulous builders who build shoddy homes and the trcc has never provided homeowners with that kind of protection
5889143 we were created to help consumers and builders and remodelers to resolve differences thats what weve been doing
5889144 was never meant to be a true regulatory agency with a clear mission of protecting the public
5889145 still has no real power to require builders to make needed repairs
5889146 i think you are being very meticulous i would argue it is normal for dancers performers to be dressed in other races clothes i dont know exactly where these performers are from

5889151 the reason these populations are doing well is that this is one of only two large remaining blocks of rainforest in the whole world
5889152 of course most gorillas most chimpanzees mot primates arent so lucky to live in areas with such a huge unbroken expanse of habitat left for them
5889153 we have the formal commitment from the president sassou nguesso to work with us to create this as a protected area probably as a national park over the coming years
5889154 as the funding becomes available to do that and as international plans move forward for thinking about how countrys can be rewarded for protecting their forests and not promoting climate change

5889179 la tarea es coordinarnos en una misma l nea y la misi n es que el equipo califique de nueva cuenta
5889180 volver a casa en esta nueva etapa y en una nueva faceta implica retos y por eso estoy muy contento es para mi un sue o cumplido que de ser jugador del club ahora sea parte de la directiva
5889181 siempre ha tenido la posibilidad de ganar es uno de los m s importante del pa s y est a la altura de cualquera
5889182 claro que le fallamos a sergio ordu a claro que se puede revertir sabemos en la situaci n que estamos a nadie nos gusta realmente es lamentable lo que le pas al profe que lo cesaron sabemos que l no es el culpable sabemos que los que estamos dentro del campo somos nosotros como dijo l se corta por lo m s delgado pero aqu todos somos culpables responsables de lo que estamos haciendo o dejando de hacer
5889183 el equipo siempre hab a jugado bien pero el futbol se gana con goles y lamentablemente no los hemos metido hemos regalado espacios y es lo que nos han ocasionado las derrotas la primera divisi n es de mucho oficio se maneja con mayor experiencia y hay que saber ordenarse m s estamos pagando errorcitos en lo grupal
5889184 no la verdad no te mentir a si te dijera quiero regresar lo antes posible pero todo depende de c mo responde la pierna
5889185 todav a no estoy al cien por ciento hay que esperar a que la pierna responda a la mejor manera la semana pasada se complic un poco se volvi a inflamar entonces creo que no ser a lo m s justo estar arriesgando algo del equipo y m s a mi persona entonces prefiero llevarla con calma y espero pronto integrarme al grupo
5889186 se da de esa forma as es el futbol hay que encarar las cosas como debe de ser la victoria contra puebla lleg en buen momento nos sirve de mucho y nos da tranquilidad para trabajar en la semana
5889187 hay un buen grupo un buen equipo y las cosas van a mejorar hay mucho material humano gran calidad entonces no debemos de dudar que vamos a seguir por buen camino

5889190 s es m s nervios y m s desesperaci n estar fuera estar viendo y un poco de impotencia el ver que no se dan las cosas pero ya se fue calmando a ra z de que cay el primer gol temprano y a pasar de eso el equipo se vio bien
5889191 tranquilos pero no a gusto con los puntos que llevamos queremos seguir sumando de a tres y creo que ahora contra chivas va a ser muy importante salir de casa y jugar en el jalisco y hacerlo de la mejor manera y ganar los tres puntos all
5889192 contento por haber marcado nuevamente en el futbol mexicano siempre he dicho que con el esfuerzo y el trabajo las cosas llegan a su tiempo tuve un poco de fortuna por el error que tuvo el portero de chivas pero de igual manera cuenta
5889193 esperemos que sea as siempre es m s dif cil anotar el primero del campeonato ya lo convert as que ahora m s tranquilo y a seguir aportando para el equipo que es lo m s importante

5889196 seventy per cent of all new zealand kids are living in an urban environment now so theyre not having a lot of the experiences that previous generations have had getting out into the bush and seeing wildlife and thats an international trend
5889197 we identified places that we could contribute positively to the environment
5889198 i enjoyed spending time at dakotafest and visiting with farmers from around the state agriculture is one of the pillars of this states economy and we need to ensure that our farmers have the tools they need for success i worked hard to secure country of origin labeling in the 2008 farm bill and will continue to fight for ag interests in the senate

5889207 yesterday 10 of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan 21 others were wounded during a joint reconnaissance mission with the afghan national army
5889208 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hit hard
5889209 the initial patrol was reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams during the engagement a large number of insurgents were killed
5889210 the president was briefed on that this morning during his intelligence briefing and sends his condolences to the loved ones of those lost as well as those wounded
5889211 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5889212 the government has full control over all parts of afghanistan
5889213 we are no doubt in a war we must remember that were in a war with the enemies of afghanistan
5889214 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
5889215 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

5889217 intels entry into the ssd market has been expected for a while and although a bit delayed represents the start of what we expect to be a very competitive market
5889218 the new generation of mlc based products are an improvement over the initial ssd offerings which had a host of issues
5889219 ssds are ideally suited for the netbook category and will eventually replace high performance hard disk drives in the enterprise segment
5889220 we expect mainstream notebooks to continue to utilize hdds for the foreseeable future
5889221 the mlc will go into production in the next 30 days and the slc in the next 90 days
5889222 right now 95 percent of the flash memory consumption is in consumer electronics devices storing photos showing videos if your card fails you throw it away
5889223 we know the data is critical we know enterprise is going to thrash these drives 24 hours a day 7 days a week for years
5889224 bottom line is enterprise users cant count on hard drives you cant predict their failure by being solid state there is that predictive ability you can predict when its going to wear out when its going to fail
5889225 this player is good at video on demand that guys good at iops input output operations per second for database its a highly fractured market
5889226 the differentiation between storage infrastructure will disappear as soon as you can put enough performance and capacity right inside the server
5889227 hard disks will become the new tape drive hard disks will store data ssds will house active data very big difference your active data tier will become a silicon tier

5889229 youve got to have the right environment to invite investment in innovation to invite investment in development
5889230 this is my political statement of the day theres really only one country where i dont see this attitude this one the u s
5889231 we dont focus as hard as we should at incentivizing investment and innovation the lapse of the r amp d tax credit is enough of a political statement today where the government refuses to acknowledge that investing in r amp d is important to the future competitiveness of the u s everyone else in the world is recognizing that
5889232 since the wiimote can track sources of infrared ir light you can track pens that have an ir led in the tip by pointing a wiimote at a projection screen or lcd display you can create very low cost interactive whiteboards or tablet displays since the wiimote can track up to four points up to four pens can be used it also works great with rear projected displays
5889233 to be interesting today technology has to be the fastest the best the brightest the lightest but here you can see if you sacrifice a little bit of capability and performance for dramatic savings in cost you can have a pretty dramatic impact
5889234 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation

5889252 he was a humble dog he was brought up as a pet at home
5889253 im not blaming the sheriffs or anything like that they were doing their job responding to a burglary and the dog was here they ran into the dog and it was a freak accident
5889254 its impossible for them to properly supervise people much less do a pre sentencing evaluation and supervise
5889255 theres been a small number of truly appalling situations but in the most part people dont hate disabled people
5889256 disabled people are often the victims we are vulnerable and perhaps remind people of their own inadequacies it makes them feel better to put us down
5889257 christine might as well have had a target on her head saying attack me victimise me
5889258 the use of the word retard referred to as the r word contradicts the basic rights of persons with disabilities pwd and the un convention on rights of pwd
5889259 it is our role to spread awareness against the use of this word that underestimates the intellectually disabled and harms the feelings of their families watching such a movie with multiple use of the r word will revive it after the years we spent trying to get rid of it and erase all of our efforts and we have to do something against it
5889260 i have received many e mails and calls regarding this movie and how it humiliates persons with intellectual disabilities i was really hurt
5889261 intellectually disabled persons have abilities and can function in many ways but ignorance of their condition leads some to describe them in such a way i will definitely reject such a movie and will be part of this campaign to create positive change
5889262 we condemn this movie and will work hard to create awareness in the local community against it
5889263 it took us time to select the appropriate term to describe this category and if this movie is screened in local cinemas our work will be destroyed we will send letters expressing our point of view to cinema halls in jordan so they cooperate with us in boycotting the movie i think they will do so when they understand our goals and what this means to families of the disabled
5889264 if it does not conform to moral and religious values we try not to show it
5889265 i refuse to hear anyone calling my children or any child with a mental disability a retard we worked to delete this word because people used to think it has the same meaning as crazy or a nut which is unacceptable
5889266 if the movie is going to be released in jordan i will not keep silent and i will fight against it
5889267 locadora online vale a pena testamos a game em casa
5889268 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5889269 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5889270 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5889271 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5889272 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5889273 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5889274 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5889275 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5889276 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5889277 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5889278 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5889279 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5889280 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5889281 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5889282 securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox today unveiled the successor to the agencys 1980s era edgar database which will give investors far faster and easier access to key financial information about public companies and mutual funds
5889283 under the control of the uvf leadership but not accessible for use by members
5889284 they said a thing in the statement it even galled me to read it out but i read it out anyhow that the arms had been bunkered beyond reach and the general de chastelain had been contacted
5889285 i said why not take the ultimate step it wouldnt only add to the statement
5889286 now i look forward if i am still living to stand on some podium to say that the uvf have decommissioned their weapons that would be my dream that would be i suppose the icing on the cake
5889287 if you are the leader you lead from the front perhaps maybe after consultation you have to have the confidence in yourself the confidence in your men to say im making a direct order here that uvf arms will be dispensed with decommissioned call it what you want i expect every man to obey that
5889288 omg do you believe topps accidentally inserted fukudomes updates and highlights card in

5889294 a pt crusier a white pt crusier doesnt exactly seem like the car of choice for gangbangers
5889295 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5889296 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5889297 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5889298 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5889299 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5889300 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5889301 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5889302 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5889303 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5889304 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5889305 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5889306 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5889307 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5889308 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5889309 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5889310 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5889311 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5889320 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5889321 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

5889326 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5889327 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5889328 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5889329 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5889330 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5889331 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5889332 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5889333 who are open to doing something on the production side
5889334 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5889335 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5889336 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5889337 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5889338 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

5889347 this is a disappointing result but it is considered appropriate in the current economic environment to adopt a conservative view on the realisation and underlying security value of strategics loan book and further increase the companys collective provision to reflect the inherent uncertainties that currently exist

5889350 remember how much fun we had when we went to the beach a few weeks ago
5889351 and im going to go home too if were not going to the beach since thats the only reason im still here
5889352 if you dont go im going to be very sad very sad and very angry

5889358 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5889359 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5889360 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5889361 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5889362 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5889363 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5889364 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in
5889365 the police officers were checking a parked car this afternoon on the road when it detonated and killed all of them
5889366 what we need to do is stabilise this business and we need to see its scale
5889367 at the moment were on a run rate of doing 25 million to 26 million for the year in terms of revenue but for this to become a 50 million to 100 million business we need to invest
5889368 he she you it broke my heart one time two time tree time
5889369 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5889370 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5889371 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5889372 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5889373 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5889374 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5889375 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5889376 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5889377 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5889378 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5889379 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5889380 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5889381 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5889382 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5889383 why do english speaking people say cheese to make you smile but chinese speakers say eggplant
5889384 the spontaneous smile of the little child is essentially truthful
5889385 certainly we all know not saying please and thank you is usually considered rude
5889386 but the list of rude behavior is much longer than those offenses im not sure why we constantly need to be reminded to smile
5889387 but we do youd think it was common sense to smile when youre with a customer
5889388 is yet another good reminder to keep a smile on your face when youre talking with customers

5889397 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5889398 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5889399 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5889400 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5889401 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5889402 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5889403 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5889404 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5889405 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5889406 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5889407 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5889408 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5889409 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5889410 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5889411 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5889412 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5889413 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5889414 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5889415 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5889416 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5889417 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit

5889425 one thing i absolutely do know though is that both in this case as in the test tour cricket australia has absolutely uppermost in its mind the safety and welfare of its players and any proposed touring party
5889426 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5889427 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution

5889430 we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers
5889431 we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features
5889432 but to genuine social experience as strategies from british born chinese are rather western like
5889433 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in
5889434 caution should be taken when generalizing findings to the entire human population
5889435 into why non verbal between people from different cultures is sometimes problematic as gaze in direct face to face interactions might land in disjointed locations

5889448 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5889449 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5889450 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5889451 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5889452 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5889453 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5889454 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5889455 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets

5889457 it is not going to be an open slather event and it will not be designed to line prospective councillors up to shoot them down
5889458 it will be a chance for people to get to know the candidates to ask questions to hear what direction candidates would like to see the future of young heading what issues concern them and why they are standing
5889459 we are trying to make it as fair as possible for everyone
5889460 we are trying to be honest and trying to put some integrity back into the process
5889461 by the end of the year it is hoped that a deal will be made based on government approvals and product sales
5889462 this will depend on the feasibility study which will involve presentations to the ministry of environment ministry of trade as well as potential customers
5889463 without exaggeration the hydrodec technology is recognised around the world as the leading waste oil refining technology
5889464 this is a great thing for the town as we employ very capable and experienced people in this high tech industry and will be sending a group to japan to set up the new plant if a deal is made
5889465 we considered the pros and cons of moving into each of the surrounding boards finally resolving that a move of the whole board into the new lachlan super board was most advantageous and likely to succeed
5889466 everyone was very positive agreeing that our boards have significant similarities and many complimentary strengths
5889467 we will be waiting to see what the minister reveals as to how the changes proceed
5889468 we are hoping she will come here and then we can give her a look at how goldenfields operates and how unique it is
5889469 i think the more people understand the complexities of water in nsw and in the goldenfields area the better they can make informed decisions
5889470 my general perception is that the mr rees appears to be very forthright and genuine in his approach to see reform for the better within regional nsw
5889471 but my personal view is that the intricacies of water across the state make it difficult to have only one model that could successfully work
5889472 the weight of scientific evidence tells us that australians are facing risks of accelerated and damaging climate change the risk can be substantially reduced by strong and early action by all major economies
5889473 effective international action is necessary if the risks of dangerous climate change are to be held to acceptable levels
5889474 while an effective response to the challenge would play out over many decades it must take shape and be in place over the next few years
5889475 without early and strong action some time before 2020 we will realise that weve indelibly surrendered to forces that have moved beyond our control
5889476 we will delude ourselves if we think that scientific uncertainties are cause for delay delaying now will eliminate attractive lower cost options
5889477 delaying now is not postponing a decision its making a decision to delay is deliberately to choose to avoid effective steps to reduce the risks of climate change to acceptable levels
5889478 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5889479 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us

5889520 if all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value there is a large number of homeowners in the united states who are in that situation
5889521 i would say its probably 70 of the volume of our foreclosures right now
5889522 its a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
5889523 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
5889524 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster
5889525 the democratic vote by however strong a majority would have no legal effect on its own and could not push aside the principles of federalism and the rule of law the rights of individuals and minorities or the operation of democracy in the other provinces or in canada as a whole democratic rights under the constitution cannot be divorced from constitutional obligations
5889526 our message has to indicate that if a clear majority of quebeckers vote on a clear question to leave canada the country will not be held together by force
5889527 should they ever win a clear majority on a clear question i would say ok the people have spoken clearly
5889528 if the qu b cois very clearly in accordance with a procedure that is very clear decide to leave canada we cannot retain them against their will
5889529 no one challenges the right of the qu b cois to stay in canada or to leave it a canada wide referendum cannot block the clearly expressed will of the qu b cois
5889530 if some day we quebeckers no longer want to be canadians and it is clear that we no longer want to be canadians well then we will be able to commit the future generations to this fundamental choice and it will happen there is no one who will hold us in canada against our will
5889531 if the qu b cois should some day vote for sovereignty how will you react
5889532 if it is a decision freely consented being a democrat profoundly a democrat i accept it
5889533 that the house recognize the qu b cois consensus according to which it belongs to the quebec people alone to freely decide its future

5889535 unified social and individual income taxes must be reduced as much as possible to socially reasonable levels for individual spending on education healthcare and pensions
5889536 you know not what you are given but forever will you know what has been taken away from you
5889537 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
5889538 they who are decrying the christian religion are undermining the solid foundation of morals the best security for the duration of free governments
5889539 and i think thats where the church has got it so hideously wrong in celibate men telling people how to live their lives its just not appropriate
5889540 we are about to celebrate 20 years in the business and weve had a really good run
5889541 the company is doing great there was no reason prompting us to sell but i see our industry changing and the firms are getting bigger and the projects are getting bigger
5889542 in a larger organization it will create some larger opportunities for our employees if someone wants to work in hong kong weve got an office there
5889543 urs has always felt that texas because of its quality of life and economy would continue to grow in population and this growth in population would necessitate new infrastructure in power transportation and water resources these are all the things that urs focuses on

5889552 re siemens layoffs yes soarian was singled out lost as i have heard 150 soarian programmers in bangalore also consider this when siemens took over sms there was a huge push to get soarian formerly known internally as tnt to be a viable installable not just marketable product so siemens threw a bunch a people at it to get the base system working its stability has greatly improved in the last year therefore why keep the overhead just a thought
5889553 re siemens layoffs revenue per employee is too low more people will leave all employees age 60 with 15 years of service have been offered early retirement thats another 100 people stopping offshore development in india is another 200
5889554 re virtualization and pacs tpd has read doctor dalais latest post on virtualization and thought it would be good reading for histalkers since the vee a tpd acronym is gaining momentum in our move to a more digital world through the proliferation of pacs and other digital systems around the world in case you didnt know tpds vee stands for virtual electronic enterprise
5889555 its not that you couldnt find people smart enough to do it you cant find people who would want to
5889556 if you mess with edgy mama youll get more than just the wrong end of my cane up your backside
5889557 its maybe the size of a tiny piece of white thread you
5889558 all you have to do is bring along some material of your choice and sewing equipment including scissors pins and needles and you
5889559 i used to sew school uniforms for the nabua village school my interest for sewing grew and i also had a keen interest to weave mats i admire women who can weave mats
5889560 the ppi has an effect on the dollar movement because eventually consumers will pay for those prices
5889561 coupled with the negative news that the financial sector has seen the market is thinking that theres going to be a lot more to go in terms of an economic housing crisis
5889562 basically theyre taking a more cautious stance on the second half
5889563 once they consciously intentionally step over the lines of our policies good judgment and the law im gonna be the first person on this police department to do everything i can to separate them from that badge
5889564 you would have no choice only if you assumed that your own ambitions were more important than your honor
5889565 bloggers are somehow responsible for mccain running juvenile ads comparing obama to paris hilton and britney spears
5889566 brooks of course never bothers actually talking about mccains negative campaigning with any specificity and needless to say he certainly never gets around to passing judgment on his tactics
5889567 frantic and freewheeling style which was unpredictable untamed and at some level unprofessional in other words erratic between obama and mccain who is the responsible adult who is prepared to lead
5889568 have you ever wondered why they pay david brooks the big bucks ill explain you see anyone can argue that john mccain is so pure and virtuous that he had to be forced into running a campaign consisting almost exclusively of vicious negative attacks and anyone can argue that longtime media darling mccain is actually pure virtuous mccain was forced to run a negative campaign because of liberal media bias thats just brilliant thats advancing two memes at once
5889569 and dont you dare wonder why we should vote to give this guy control of the country when he cant even control the direction of his campaign
5889570 she needs to be more vocal because she has the experience and ability to be a leader
5889571 she needs to create opportunities for her teammates and they need to respond
5889572 i dont think she realized the talent she had it was hard for her to be in the spotlight she didnt want to offend anyone
5889573 every once in awhile id be like why arent they trying
5889574 now after sitting im going to give it 100 percent all the time
5889575 after while it overwhelms you because you want to play
5889576 once i got the captain role i said to myself i need to be here for my team and not be so selfish
5889577 we had a lot of good things going for us so i wasnt going to be like poor me
5889578 when i first got in i was kind of freaked out
5889579 it was justice that she got to be part of our season statistically
5889580 i told the kids this week that they are now playing for a state championship team until someone takes it away
5889581 well need to find more guys to score some goals for us
5889582 every one of them looks much stronger and more aggressive
5889583 hopefully itll get better in a few weeks and go from there
5889584 surgery is definitely not on my lifetime check list so i dont want to end up going under hopefully i can get back on the field in a couple of weeks
5889585 today when i woke up i could actually sit up in bed rather than roll out the side and fall on my face
5889586 its not 100 percent that hell be ready but its not 100 percent that hell have an operation
5889587 weve got that in between those two weeks to find out
5889588 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5889589 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5889590 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5889591 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5889592 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5889593 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5889594 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5889595 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5889596 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5889597 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5889598 last time it was a minus net nine percent so on balance people thought it was a bad time to buy
5889599 now on balance people think its a good time to buy and to put that in perspective thats just ahead of the levels we were at in early 07 when the market was actually going quite well
5889600 our communities our borough and our city deserve a real world class park with year round recreation without having our waterfront turned into a de facto backyard for luxury condo towers
5889601 shes definitely our intensity leader her motor never slows down
5889602 hopefully this her wisdom teeth is the last medical emergency of the year
5889603 so were going to have to play our rear ends off to ever put ourselves in position to talk about a conference title or anything like that
5889604 but she is interested in being someone who steps up in more ways than just smashing balls over the net last year her part of the pie was making good plays not someone who was going to rally the troops
5889605 i think were going to be decent at everything but if we go in thinking were going to lose were going to lose were all a lot better and should be a lot more competitive this fall
5889606 obviously well evaluate him every day he gets in here and see how his knee is holding up
5889607 theres still internal discussions about what were going to do and i should have something for you before we go to baltimore
5889608 we have to wait and see how some things come out and then ill give it to you on thursday
5889609 it feels a lot better than it has which is a good sign its coming out good the more i play catch the better it feels
5889610 i just have it up until saturday and well see how he feels come sunday morning
5889611 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5889612 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5889613 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5889614 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5889615 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5889616 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5889617 well just try to match up the best way we can
5889618 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5889619 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5889620 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5889621 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5889622 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5889623 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5889624 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5889625 its very eye opening that the vast majority of plans are small
5889626 a private event for her close family and friends it was low key
5889627 but also absolutely integral for the functioning of the family
5889628 i realized a very basic difference in attitude between japanese and american cultures toward serving another in my family to serve another could be uplifting a gracious gesture that elevated oneself for many white americans it seems that serving another is degrading an indication of dependence or weakness in character or a low place in the social ladder
5889629 serving humanity is the greatest virtue giving service of yourself is more worthy than selling the service or goods of another
5889630 i dont know what your destiny will be but one thing i do know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve

5889875 ele pediu lateral e estamos tentando o m rcio caeca mas quer tamb m um jogador para acalmar o jogo distribuir a bola estamos vendo as possibilidades mas complicado
5889876 ele um grande jogador e muito bem visto por n s queremos muito a volta dele mas nesse momento os valores da negocia o n o permitem um acerto
5889877 sab amos que o momento era complicado e que precis vamos de uma vit ria hoje ter a feira jogamos fora de casa e respeitamos a for a do mar lia mas precis vamos dessa recupera o e o jogo valia muito para n s
5889878 nossa equipe tem qualidade e n s sabemos que essa situa o na tabela complicada precis vamos reagir e conversamos muito sobre isso t nhamos de fazer um bom jogo contra o mar lia
5889879 n s vacilamos no come o do jogo e depois ficou complicado correr atr s o brasiliense se fechou demais e n s n o encontramos espa os para jogar e chegar na defesa deles
5889880 n o temos nenhum contato com esse atleta conhecemos o futebol dele e ele realmente passou pelos nosso planos mas quando fomos estudar os valores vimos que est muito distante do que podemos pagar hoje

5889928 its not worth spending extra for quote unquote organic seafood
5889929 there is no such thing because the government has no standards for what organic seafood means
5889930 its best to buy the organics when the conventional versions of them are very loaded with pesticides
5889931 one other thing that we found is that fruits and veggies that are imported tend to have more pesticides than those that are domestically grown
5889932 they are not allowed to use heavy duty pesticides or synthetic fertilizers so its not a bad idea to buy organic wine especially if you are concerned about the environment

5889941 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
