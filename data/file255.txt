2550239 the operation of forces within this country that are not accountable to any military but appear to be controlled by foreign intelligence services
2550240 i have spoken with a large number of people in relation to the operation of foreign intelligence units
2550241 it is clear that there are certain units operating in certain provinces the names are well known to those involved and these forces operate with what appears to be impunity
2550242 id been living in london when my world turned upside down and id had to come home by the time my plane landed back in sydney all i had left was a carry on bag full of clothes and a world of troubles no one to welcome me back no place to call home i was a tourist in my hometown

2550244 be strong and courageous do not be afraid do not be discouraged for the lord your god is with you wherever you go he goes before you and will be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you
2550245 for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
2550246 i pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the saints

2550248 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising god and enjoying the favor of all the people and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved

2550252 why not run rancheros and el caminos thats a car and a truck
2550253 from an owners perspective you can run a truck on about half of what you can run a nationwide budget on maybe a little less than that actually
2550254 for the manufacturers trucks make sense just for the fact that they sell more trucks than they do anything else
2550255 weve been fortunate to make it make sense and be a part of the series and look forward to being a part of the series for a while to come i think theres a lot of things in motion for the nationwide series to take place as we go forward and i think collectively as owners nascar everybody is working in the same direction to make that better

2550264 the growing trend of companies tailoring internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use

2550273 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2550274 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked and i guarantee you its going to happen again i promise you
2550275 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2550276 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2550277 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2550278 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2550279 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2550280 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2550281 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2550282 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2550283 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2550284 la verdad es que l me dejaba como nueva despu s de nuestras sesiones

2550288 violaciones de los acuerdos anteriores de paz y alto el fuego
2550289 un intento de involucrar a otros pa ses y pueblos en sus sanguinarias aventuras
2550290 creo que esto es ahora obvio tanto en georgia y rusia como en el resto del mundo
2550291 las acciones de las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur son por supuesto un crimen y ante todo

2550301 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2550302 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2550303 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2550304 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2550305 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2550306 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2550307 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2550308 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2550309 theres something fundamentally wrong with a world where children have to live like this
2550310 he sent for me he wants me to come to the hidden hall but
2550311 but no one can find the hall unless theyve been brought there
2550312 you look drained would you like a cup of coffee
2550313 you see im working on a project for a very important client and i could use your help my client is conducting vital research in the area of ultrasonics however to continue this research i need to get a component for a new device theyve developed
2550314 thats not really important right now the important part is the component a bathroom ipod stereo deck do you know where i can get such a component
2550315 she always keeps it in her lab coat pocket not that shed part with it i suspect
2550316 what do you think it would take to convince her to give it up
2550317 and she and her friends would stop you before you could do that anyway
2550318 no one is suggesting taking it by force and violence
2550319 thanks this stuff is amazing i mean amazing i really like it it really provides just the right pick me up you know what i mean
2550320 now im sure by now youre wondering who this client is
2550321 id love to accommodate you but im afraid the schupakinator took the last of it
2550322 she did well well took the last of my coffee well just see about that
2550323 i had some help with it its like trucker coffee but with extra kick
2550324 hes had the caffeine equivalent of a dozen cups just now which should take care of the schupakinator i trust you can get me the component now
2550325 soon it wont matter if they all know that the instructor is just one guise of mine
2550326 remember we need the component delivered to the movie theater
2550327 i have no problem getting the component for you but i have no intention of actually killing anyone for this project im not a villain whatever bgg or anyone else may think
2550328 assuming you are no villain yourself you still have not told me what the device being built is
2550329 there are still too many variables to divulge that information
2550330 if youll excuse me i have two more movements to play
2550331 we want states to decide if they want to drill for oil but you cant drill within 50 miles of the coast so alaska no anwr and only four coastal states can drill

2550388 our conclusions show that we think weve peaked in terms of the housing valuations and were in a period of sustained decline going forward
2550389 as people buy fewer homes well also expect them to buy fewer of the things that go into new homes for example drapes and furniture and things like that

2550648 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences it is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order

2550676 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2550677 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2550678 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2550679 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2550681 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2550682 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2550683 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2550684 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2550686 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2550687 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2550688 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2550689 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2550690 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2550691 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2550692 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2550693 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2550694 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2550695 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2550696 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2550702 but the morocco of poverty backward countryside and urban slums is increasingly averse to tourism and the internationalized elite
2550703 its discrimination by wealth and tourism is highlighting the sore

2550705 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree

2550708 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2550709 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2550710 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2550713 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it
2550714 apple runs the app store so youll have to ask them about the availability of this and other apps for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capabilities at amp t has a number of other options to choose from
2550715 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2550716 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem

2550718 they want privacy in their rooms and on the phones
2550719 even if they bellow at the top of their voices
2550720 they will say it is only among my friends and i say do you want to go into law or medicine and do you want this information to come back in 20 years time they say they deleted it and they are unaware that the material still stays around
2550721 this may override any thoughts or concerns about the ramifications of sacrificing privacy
2550722 we were warned back in year 10 about putting pictures of yourself on the internet because people would still be able to see them in the future
2550723 people can google you and your facebook can come up and if they can get on to it and see something inappropriate you could lose out on a job opportunity in the future
2550724 we all realise that if you do upload a picture of yourself someone could look at it in the next second and in the time between you uploading and deleting it that someone could have saved it and sent it on to other people
2550725 we have had a lot of education about it at school and you hear about it on the news
2550726 it is our stuff they dont have any right to snoop
2550727 i believe that many young people are aware or are becoming aware through education about the facts that deleted emails messages and photos can be traced or recovered and that lost privacy cannot be restored
2550728 but the unknown or possible consequences of this may not influence their actions as much as we might hope
2550729 intimacy is much easier to create and less risky in a lot of ways than person to person contact connections with many people or groups can be established quickly it is far easier to join a conversation or ask to be added to a myspace page than to approach a person face to face and risk social rejection to an extent you can control the information that others have about you they cant judge you on your looks if they cant see you
2550730 as teenagers we used to put locks on our diaries so nobody could read them
2550731 i would argue that individuals still have to take personal responsibility for the way they allow others to use their information for example even on facebook you can look at the privacy policy and adjust the settings
2550732 so many young people are exposing themselves in ways that later in life they are going to regret big brother contestants are included that footage is forever and people can record it
2550733 a party might look for the cleanest possible candidate one with the least facebook images
2550734 the older generation has to be careful of making presumptions about the attitudes of youth
2550735 the facebook phenomenon could also be seen as a reflection of the fact that a certain openness about ones private life is now accepted as a fact of life for young people
2550736 they have got to get some technically competent people to talk about the science
2550737 for all i know they may have it down cold but they need to be transparent
2550738 the crocodile is hungry from the point of view of someone who wants to keep his own leg thats hard to accept
2550739 nothing can be heard through the thunder of the mind
2550740 given how few serious problems face the united states in this election year it was inevitable that oregons u s senate campaign would get to the issue of furniture not to mention rugs
2550741 we can sympathize with smiths point theres a certain appeal to the idea of state legislators assembling their own office furniture from ikea
2550742 150 000 oregonians a year visit the capitol producing hard wear on its furniture and rugs in the last purchase when the two new legislative wings were added 30 years ago the state went cheap with predictable results this time a bipartisan committee of six legislators concluded it would be better to buy furniture likely to last 50 years oregon corrections enterprises a group that can be counted on to still be around and standing behind its work 50 years from now
2550743 still there are reasons smith might have been startled by the whole state capitol remodeling project after all oregons effort is being finished in time and under the original 34 million budget leaving 4 million to fix ceiling leaks that hadnt been addressed in the original plan
2550744 during most of the construction smiths republicans were in charge of congress and smith himself was on the key senate committee on finance and upholstery
2550745 i shouldnt have said it that way let me start over
2550746 i dont feel i discuss this in a positive way any longer but if there are things you need to tell me you can write it down and i will look at it again later when im ready

2550766 im running a more grassroots door to door campaign this year
2550767 ive walked over 500 miles so far thousands of homes that ive been to
2550768 its alarming that so many people have given up on democracy and just say when they come to the door i cant stand it anymore go away im not registered i dont vote in fact thats one of the reasons im running for office for me both major parties have been derelict in their leadership to put it mildly
2550769 i can say what i need to say you dont get anywhere with the two major parties unless you sell yourself to them i was willing to do that in 2006 because i still believed in their message and that they were serious about getting us out of iraq i really did i was take in i was very angry when pelosi took all of that off the table it was the clincher for me the democrats dont want people who think for themselves they want people who they can control just like the republicans do people who think for themselves dont make it in the two major parties
2550770 im not going there to be miss congeniality im going there to help my country and to help the people of this district im not going there to whore myself out or to be anybodys ass kisser im going to do the things i need to do to satisfy my own conscience and work for the well being of our people im not going to be like kathy dahlkemper kathy dahlkemper is an idiot she cant speak four coherent sentences in a row shes a woman who doesnt believe in choice but shes well packaged and shes exactly what the democrats want someone they can lead by the nose

2550777 what struck me was the complete depth of microsoft software that the updates will touch this month
2550778 the bug could be a cross over to multiple programs
2550779 it will be a different kind of work this month
2550780 the potential for downtime is a little less for one thing if a single laptop fails because it didnt get its ie patch thats not so bad as last month when an exchange server could have gone down after patching
2550781 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2550782 there is no other system in the u s that has that kind of extensive network of cameras

2550807 the complexities of what we are given in life are vast and beyond comprehension it was as if my father had given me by way of temperament an impossibly wild dark and unbroken horse it was a horse without a name and a horse with no experience of a bit between its teeth my mother taught me to gentle it gave me the discipline and love to break it and as alexander had known so intuitively with bucephalus she understood and taught me that the beast was best handled by turning it toward the sun

2550821 i had no idea politics was going to be involved
2550822 all the political pressure was in favor of the prosecutor

2550824 you cant take the politics out of it it may be that the system is inherently flawed

2550852 we are turning the heat up but it is only against all the competition has nothing to do with kyle busch
2550853 but at the same time let me first say i have always said how much talent kyle has and the respect i have for him but when you said people in the past have coasted that is not kyle busch that is not how he does things he doesnt know how to coast last week i saw the right side flat on his car you know the guy doesnt know how to coast i think they are pushing hard they are trying hard and they might win this weekend who knows that is the kind of year they have had where theyve been able to surprise you when you least expected it i still think they are definitely one of the teams to beat in the chase especially with those bonus points but just like you said that jimmie said they have shown some vulnerability to me right now if i had to put my chips on the table i would day you have got jimmie and carl that to me that seem like the guys that are the guys to beat then i would put kyle next if all things were equal without the bonus points i put myself in there just because our team is so consistent on all those 10 tracks that are in the chase

2550874 john mccain has been the leading proponent of storing nuclear waste in the state of nevada while barack obama has been adamantly opposed to yucca mountain from the start
2550875 what we have to make sure of is that we have the capacity to store it properly and safely
2550876 i want every nevadan to know that i have always opposed using yucca mountain as a nuclear waste repository and i want to explain the many reasons why ive held that view

2550910 i imagine that just as any comedian longs to play hamlet and any pianist yearns to play in carnegie hall so any nonprofessional jokester has the secret dream of telling a joke on television that finally happened to me in january 1970 i was on a talk show along with a professional jokester and the moon flights were mentioned the professional asked if i had heard the joke about the israeli space venture and i said yes this was a slip of jokesters etiquette i ought to have said no and asked him to tell it naturally he asked me to tell it with belated humility i tried to back out but he wouldnt let me he insisted i tell it trembling a little with stage fright i told the joke and thank heaven got an entirely satisfactory laugh from the live audience anyway this has placed this one joke in a quite special class for me and so i shall use it to close and climax the section on paradox

2550917 i can still remember how the villagers used to run to a rocky cliff when tamils attack our village we spend two to three days there until the situation comes back to normal

2550920 if he has done some damage to our organisation or to a person especially when he has done something which he is not supposed to do then it is natural he must be living in fear if they think that they have done something of that nature the best thing for them is to correct themselves and rectify the mistake these so called media guys are not responsible to the people and they are not entitled to such media freedom

2550929 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2550930 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2550931 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2550932 a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing
2550933 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2550934 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2550935 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2550936 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2550937 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2550945 people of faith make up a crucial american demographic frankly we would think it rather odd if an administration neglected religious groups in its sphere of contacts
2550946 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

2551051 a ustedes se les ha concedido conocer los misterios del reino de los cielos pero a ellos no porque a quien tiene se le dar m s todav a y tendr en abundancia pero al que no tiene se le quitar aun lo que tiene por eso les hablo por medio de par bolas porque miran y no ven oyen y no escuchan ni entienden y as se cumple en ellos la profec a de isa as que dice por m s que oigan no comprender n por m s que vean no conocer n porque el coraz n de este pueblo se ha endurecido tienen tapados sus o dos y han cerrado sus ojos para que sus ojos no vean y sus o dos no oigan y su coraz n no comprenda y no se conviertan y yo no los cure felices en cambio los ojos de ustedes porque ven felices sus o dos porque oyen les aseguro que muchos profetas y justos desearon ver lo que ustedes ven y no lo vieron o r lo que ustedes oyen y no lo oyeron escuchen entonces lo que significa la par bola del sembrador cuando alguien oye la palabra del reino y no la comprende viene el maligno y arrebata lo que hab a sido sembrado en su coraz n este es el que recibi la semilla al borde del camino el que la recibe en terreno pedregoso es el hombre que al escuchar la palabra la acepta en seguida con alegr a pero no la deja echar ra ces porque es inconstante en cuanto sobreviene una tribulaci n o una persecuci n a causa de la palabra inmediatamente sucumbe el que recibe la semilla entre espinas es el hombre que escucha la palabra pero las preocupaciones del mundo y la seducci n de las riquezas la ahogan y no puede dar fruto y el que la recibe en tierra f rtil es el hombre que escucha la palabra y la comprende este produce fruto ya sea cien ya sesenta ya treinta por uno
2551052 this is a day of incredible celebration for our countrys newest generation of veterans and their families thanks to todays passage of a modern gi bill the future is much brighter for the more than 1 6 million americans who have served in the current conflicts
2551053 in supporting this gi bill senators webb hagel warner lautenberg and hundreds of other lawmakers laid aside their partisan differences and put the troops first their vision and perseverance will change the course of an entire generation iava is also grateful to its tens of thousands of members nationwide who participated in the fight for a new gi bill

2551064 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2551065 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2551066 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2551067 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2551068 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2551069 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2551070 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2551071 im running a more grassroots door to door campaign this year
2551072 ive walked over 500 miles so far thousands of homes that ive been to
2551073 its alarming that so many people have given up on democracy and just say when they come to the door i cant stand it anymore go away im not registered i dont vote in fact thats one of the reasons im running for office for me both major parties have been derelict in their leadership to put it mildly
2551074 i can say what i need to say you dont get anywhere with the two major parties unless you sell yourself to them i was willing to do that in 2006 because i still believed in their message and that they were serious about getting us out of iraq i really did i was take in i was very angry when pelosi took all of that off the table it was the clincher for me the democrats dont want people who think for themselves they want people who they can control just like the republicans do people who think for themselves dont make it in the two major parties
2551075 im not going there to be miss congeniality im going there to help my country and to help the people of this district im not going there to whore myself out or to be anybodys ass kisser im going to do the things i need to do to satisfy my own conscience and work for the well being of our people im not going to be like kathy dahlkemper kathy dahlkemper is an idiot she cant speak four coherent sentences in a row shes a woman who doesnt believe in choice but shes well packaged and shes exactly what the democrats want someone they can lead by the nose
2551076 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2551077 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
2551078 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
2551079 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
2551080 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
2551081 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
2551082 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
2551083 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2551084 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2551085 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2551086 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2551087 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2551088 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2551089 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
2551090 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells
2551091 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
2551092 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2551093 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2551094 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2551095 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
2551096 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
2551097 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
2551098 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
2551099 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
2551100 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2551101 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2551102 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2551103 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
2551104 the data collected through this project will assist designers and engineers in developing more sophisticated assistive aids for individuals suffering from various neuromuscular diseases and musculoskeletal injuries
2551105 better orthotic technologies could ultimately help people suffering from this disease greatly enhance the quality of their life

2551119 thomas hawk was forcibly removed from the san francisco moma by two security guards at the direction of the over zealous simon blint director of visitor relations how ironic is that why taking photos in the atrium sf moma policy on this their own web site specifically allows photography in the atrium hawk had also previously confirmed this personally with thea stein in the marketing and communications department of the museum didnt matter to simon blint who according to hawk went all aggressive and power trip happy even trying to eject his companion
2551120 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2551121 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2551122 what he didnt say was tell us who was responsible for giving you money to give to me and well urge the authorities to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
2551123 the letter raises the question is the mccain campaign covering for his bundlers
2551124 an executive from a company that has a billion dollar contract to deliver oil to u s bases in iraq possibly violated election law to funnel contributions to mccain we think that warrants an investigation
2551125 an office manager for an oil company that stands to gain millions in profits from offshore drillingmakes donations for the first time this cycle to mccain and did it at the same time nine other hess donors do thats worth an investigation

2551182 he still came into the gym and practiced his shot
2551183 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that
2551184 but i dont think so i didnt see anything like that
2551185 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see
2551186 seriously one person cannot change the outcome of a game
2551187 if found guilty it would affect his eligibility to play in puerto rico

2551189 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2551190 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2551191 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2551192 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2551193 when you think about it one day you could actually save somebodys life to me thats something really important that you should do
2551194 we thought it would be like anything else a one year thing
2551195 but now were starting to talk bone marrow transplant because some of the therapy is not working
2551196 if youre a caucasian a plain vanilla caucasian your chance of getting a match is about 80 percent but it drops off dramatically if youre a minority
2551197 these guys are young their cells are viable they will be able to donate for many years which is extremely important and theyre male those are big criteria
2551198 those are the ones we really want because those are the ones that are going to graft or actually work in a patient
2551199 i thought heck why couldnt we weve got a lot of strong healthy young guys if theyre willing to do it
2551200 we just informed them that if they wanted to thered be this opportunity
2551201 hopefully a lot of division i schools will see what coach stoops is doing and then hopefully do it
2551202 if we get all these numbers of people to get their dna out there youre bound to find someone who will meet your match and save thousands or millions of lives
2551203 i think as much as anything just the general public doesnt realize maybe how easy it is to be on the registry i just did it in a total of 5 minutes
2551204 i understand there will be a process if i were to be a donor for it but i think to help someone to improve their life or to give them a chance to live its worth it maybe the little bit of discomfort it might be to give them that chance
2551205 theres a lot of kids who need bone marrow transplants and its just an opportunity for us to add to the possibilities that theyll find a match and that theyll be able to get the transplant that they need
2551206 a lot of these kids need it to help them live so its just something that we can do to help people out

2551215 i really didnt love america until i was deprived of her company
2551216 okay so im feeling a bit worried right now but really everything is okay im strong im smart and im capable of finishing my work on time ill do my best and everything will work out fine
2551217 today is going to be a great day everything will go my way and ill enjoy plenty of positive opportunities and fun

2551235 in 1954 the most powerful men in the world met for the first time under the auspices of the dutch royal crown and the rockefeller family at the luxurious hotel bilderberg in the small dutch town of oosterbeck for an entire weekend the debated the future of the world when it was over they decided to meet once every year to exchange ideas and analyze international affairs they named themselves the bilderberg group since then they have gathered yearly in a luxurious hotel somewhere in the world to try to decide the future of humanity among the select members of this club are bill clinton paul wolfowitz henry kissinger david rockefeller zbigniew brzezinski tony blair and many other heads of government businessmen politicians bankers and journalists from all over the world

2551262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2551263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2551266 yes of course a corporation should be treated as a natural person and the government shouldnt be taxing either one
2551267 no such thing as the public only individuals have objective existence
2551268 i lifted myself up by my own god damned bootstraps
2551269 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2551270 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2551271 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2551280 snow slab avalanches are believed to begin by the gravity driven shear failure of weak layers in stratified snow the critical crack length for shear crack propagation along such layers should increase without bound as the slope decreases however recent experiments show that the critical length of artificially introduced cracks remains constant or if anything slightly decreases with decreasing slope
2551281 scientists had previously thought that the gravity tugging on the slope drives the avalanche and that the critical crack size to start an avalanche should increase as the slope angle decreases but field experiments suggest this is not the case heierlis team addressed the discrepancy by modeling gravitys tug on the snow along the slope and the downward pull of gravity perpendicular to the slope finding the perpendicular pull was more important
2551282 this surprising observation can be understood in terms of volumetric collapse of the weak layer during failure resulting in the formation and propagation of mixed mode anticracks which are driven simultaneously by slope parallel and slope normal components of gravity such fractures may propagate even if crack face friction impedes downhill sliding of the snowpack indicating a scenario in which two separate conditions have to be met for slab avalanche release
2551283 its important for you to make your decision now because it will begin to get harder again tomorrow

2551311 im currently working on my debut book coming out next year
2551312 what is the book going to be about for now i have to keep the details of my book top secret until im permitted to speak about it
2551313 i have not shared with anyone what the book will be about
2551314 why people fight and die for a few square meters yards of land why
2551315 the united states is working with our european partners to launch international mediation and with the parties to restart their dialogue russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2551316 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2551317 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2551318 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2551319 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2551320 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2551321 we were fairly close especially the second set it was just a matter of keeping my nerve not thinking about what the score was just playing the point
2551322 i tried everything and it was very close this was a very important game for me of course i am disappointed but that is how it goes
2551323 she had nothing to lose she wanted to come up with me hard im really proud that i fought back and got that victory in the end
2551324 hell go pro i live in the same area as gavin and i know him very well
2551325 i knew he was struggling at that weight 60kg but i didnt know it was this bad
2551326 i knew something was wrong at the eu tournament in poland in june where he was fighting at lightwelterweight 64kg
2551327 in the final tournament before the olympics a boxer should be fighting at his own weight not the one above
2551328 maybe he thought there was still six to eight weeks to get down in weight but he couldnt do it
2551329 he won the world championships in chicago in october and who was ringside now a promoter put two and two together
2551330 but its more difficult to assess how a fighter will adapt to professional boxing
2551331 amateur boxing is a tic tac game theres not as much power its about speed speed of movement its not as good a preparation for the professional game as it was in my day
2551332 hes got all the skills and that but will he be powerful enough tactically hes very good hes a beautiful boxer amir khan and the problems hes having hes hitting guys but hes not taking them out theyre walking straight through
2551333 lets face it he was most peoples hopes and favourite for the gold medal
2551334 i recorded the stories because we feared that my grandmother would die soon but she didnt she even saw the play when it opened in los angeles
2551335 ive been really looking forward to this trip and feeling at various times during the last 40 years that its ridiculous that i havent been back here since i was 10
2551336 this is a wonderful opportunity to dovetail my personal desire to have a homecoming with this show which is based on stories that my grandmother told me when i was a kid in the philippines
2551337 i discovered a whole side of my family history and culture that was so different from what i knew as a chinese american kid born and raised in la it helped me have a larger vision of myself and what i could be to meet all these relatives and understand the history of our family in this country
2551338 i didnt think of myself as a writer i didnt know anything about the theater and i didnt write again in any major sense until after i got to college when i decided to try my hand at being a playwright
2551339 skip forward another 20 years in the 1990s when i was in my 40s i decided to go back to that novel that i had written when i was 10 and base a play on it and that became the golden child
2551340 my mother really wants me to tell everybody that a lot of things in the play are fictional
2551341 thats true but at the same time its based on the stories of my family and the stories my grandmother told me which are very much the seed of the work thats presented here
2551342 im thrilled that hes the person at the helm of this production
2551343 i couldnt be happier that my homecoming coincides with the presentation of a play that began here in the philippines 40 years ago
2551344 well youre not very happy and youre my role model
2551345 on may 27 1966 from six in the morning to nightfall political prisoners were executed continuously by firing squad in havanas la cabana prison one hundred and sixty six men were executed that day and each had 5 pints of blood extracted prior to being shot
2551346 extracting this amount of blood often produces cerebral anemia and unconsciousness so that many had to be carried to the execution wall on stretchers the corpses were then transported by trucks to a mass grave in a cemetery outside the city of marianao on that day the truck required seven trips to deliver all the corpses on 13th street in havanas vedado district soviet medical personnel have established a blood bank where this blood is transported and stored this blood is sold at fifty u s dollars per pint to the republic of north viet nam

2551360 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2551361 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

2551380 hai jagoan kamu pasti tadi berdoa kepada tuhan agar kamu menang bukan
2551381 sepertinya tak adil untuk meminta pada tuhan untuk menolongmu mengalahkan orang lain
2551382 aku hanya bermohon pada tuhan supaya aku tak menangis jika aku kalah
2551383 jangan berdo meminta keringanan dalam setiap ujian tapi mintalah kekuatan untuk dapat memenuhi kewajiban dan segala ujian yg kita hadapi
2551384 hmm tidak semua binatang bisa kau kalahkan aku menantangmu untuk membuktikan bahwa aku bisa mengalahkanmu aku menantangmu untuk bertanding melompat siapakah yang paling tinggi diantara kita di depan sana ada pagar yang tinggi mari kita bertanding siapakah yang bisa melompati pagar tersebut
2551385 hebat kamu menjadi pemenang untuk perlombaan kedua ini tapi pemenangnya belum ada kita masih harus mengadakan lomba ketiga karena pada dasarnya pemenang dari setiap perlombaan yang kita adakan adalah mereka yang menentukan standard perlombaannya pada saat lomba pertama kamu yang menentukan standard perlombaannya dan kamu yang menang demikian pula lomba kedua saya yang menentukan saya pula yang menang

2551389 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2551390 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2551391 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2551392 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2551393 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2551394 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use

2551410 i saw so many dead people so many walking with the skin dropping off of their faces and hands so many with their faces terribly bloated
2551411 i dont know i guess there would have been more people die in an invasion but not all in one place
2551412 it is hard to say that it should have been bombed
2551413 we would not have given up i think if not for the bombing
2551414 we were each to kill one and then ourselves we were not to surrender
2551415 there was really no morality about it there was a real chance of the germans getting it and we knew they were working on it it was a question of war it had gone beyond morality everybody was terrified of the germans finding this first it was a matter of life and death

2551425 the rams are definitely on the cusp could stumble but i see the rams winning their division and depending on health perhaps making some noise in the playoffs
2551426 im a little biased because i play on the defense but were going to be more of a defensive team
2551427 its been a while since people thought defense around here
2551428 i like what we have we have veterans who can still play the young guys compliment them well its a good group
2551429 having him back gives us that speed we need off the corner
2551430 the more and more comfortable hes getting the more and more you see the flashes of why he was taken with the second pick

2551436 the bloody crisis in south ossetia is directly tracable to western backing of kosovos secession
2551437 moscow and a few other capitals considered the move a serious step toward the degradation of international law and the triumph of arbitrary approaches to the resolution of global problems
2551438 the putin dynastys legitimacy is based around the idea of russian national resurgence and if a ridiculous little country like georgia manages to give the russian empire a bloody nose and get away with it putin and medvedev become vulnerable this i think is the most dangerous part of the crisis for georgia russia will pull out the stops to win this war if they cant win easy then theyll win hard because russias leadership really doesnt want to be beaten the problem isnt just external i dont really believe that reputational effects matter for international politics but even i wonder whether the rest of russias near abroad would get restless if the russians failed to discipline georgia and im damn sure that putin and medvedev do take reputation very seriously and will spend considerable blood and treasure to make sure russias neighbors remain intimidated

2551449 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2551450 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2551451 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2551452 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2551453 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2551454 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 per cent of the tree
2551455 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2551456 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2551457 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2551458 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2551459 there was so much unpleasantness in the workaday world the last thing you ever wanted to do at night was go home and do the dishes and just the idea that part of the weekend had to be dedicated to getting the oil changed and doing the laundry was enough to make those of us still full from lunch want to lie down in the hallway and force anyone dumb enough to remain committed to walk around us
2551460 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2551461 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2551462 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2551463 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2551464 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2551465 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2551466 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse

2551707 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2551708 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2551709 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2551710 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2551711 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2551712 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see
2551713 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2551714 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2551715 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2551716 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2551717 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2551718 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2551719 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2551720 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2551721 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2551722 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2551723 due mainly to a slump in the construction industry the unemployment rate for hispanics in the u
2551724 the spike in hispanic unemployment has hit immigrants especially hard
2551725 take a license and exploit it with a crappy game
2551726 yeah but the price you see there is only for one not for the pair
2551727 man i wish there was a store like this when i was a teenager
2551728 gracias a dios por tener televisi n gracias por este medio maravilloso que nos permite estar all en directo de repente perdemos la capacidad de asombro y no nos damos cuenta de esta maravilla con la que contamos fue una gran transmisi n oficial una gran ceremonia fue un espect culo que vale la pena ver muchas veces porque nos habla de un pueblo con ganas de hacer bien las cosas adem s fue una transmisi n perfecta gloriosa espectacular y por supuesto muy competitiva por parte de las televisoras mexicanas
2551729 yo tengo un grave problema no soporto a los narradores de la televisi n mexicana de repente se les olvida que est n haciendo televisi n hay unos que piensan que est n haciendo radio entonces nunca te dejan disfrutar de la ceremonia y hay otros que pierden la proporci n y sienten que est n en la cantina con los cuates no es lo mismo estar ante un micr fono habl ndole a un p blico nacional e internacional que estar en una cantina con los cuates
2551730 fue demasiado comentado no a veces daban ganas de decir

2551733 my attorney had never been able to accept the notion often espoused by former drug abusers that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them and neither have i for that matter
2551734 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
2551735 god i pray thee light these idle sticks of my life and may i burn for thee consume my life my god for it is thine i seek not a long life but a full one like you lord jesus
2551736 the father seeks those who will worship him in spirit and truth
2551737 saw this on the east side of kenmore across from dib sushi
2551738 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells
2551739 tudo o que me diz respeito est sob as b n os de deus e vir a meu benef cio na hora certa o que me faz feliz est sendo preparado pelos que me querem bem aqui na terra e nos c us
2551740 it was close to 20k when i arrived or so i heard i didnt stop to count
2551741 took a service taxi that only charged me 2000 lebanese which is 1 jd
2551742 i had sex with that woman but she meant nothing to me
2551743 we want to share a genuine family experience with our outlying communities as well as educate our visitors about farm products animal husbandry and importance about agriculture in our society today
2551744 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2551745 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2551746 meeting the blood relatives of the man who built this wonderful old building was indeed a thrill
2551747 i have always been interested in the history of this special spot it was at the heart of development for the whole of parke county
2551748 if people knew this beautiful site was here they would come and see it
2551749 the los angeles times was first to break the fred brito story wide open on august 17 2005 with a five page piece entitled
2551750 each morning as he backed down the driveway of his glassell park home federiqkoe dibritto iii
2551751 fred came here with awesome ideas and was bent on proving himself to ucla executives he was not a chair warmer just to collect a pay check in fact i workd very closely with him and i was literally amazd to see him work he is a real charmer and i guess he did such a great job that at the end of the day he did in fact raise a lot of money for ucla they in return should be thankful as they received more than thay paid him to do i was certainly impressed with fred
2551752 ill do whatever i can to ensure that my parents have proper care and if that means that i have to lie to get a job then im sorry mr and mrs society you give me no other choice
2551753 i was personally taken by his zest for life his motivation but most of all his sense of honesty and humbleness
2551754 he was so very polished energetic and he was extremely articulate
2551755 freds a good guy hes good at what he does he gives more of himself hes a kind giving caring nurturing and loving person you never get a no from fred
2551756 he raised well over six million dollars while he was employed there and it was more than anyone has ever raised in a six month period it is unknown where brito learned so much but it was clear that he had significant talents in operations and how to raise huge amount of funds it just came naturally for him
2551757 what brought suspicion was the level of involvement that he wanted in the scholarship program
2551758 this was the first time we called the police on someone who was actually giving us money for a scholarship but once we learned of his background we felt safe in notifying authorities asking them to investigate
2551759 defendant is a well developed con artist and deserves state prison
2551760 i tried to get a legitimate job and i couldnt
2551761 after hearing no so many times you have to think out of the box and think of another way to do it
2551762 i played the role of a psychiatrist and my friend was able to walk out of jail
2551763 hes done bad things but he did it for good to help the poor
2551764 he was very persuasive and legitimate appearing in his role as a priest
2551765 when it comes to liturgy people will know when you are stumbling around this guy was pretty slick
2551766 he was the best i had ever seen brito was by far much better than some of my authentic catholic priests i assigned him to lead two hispanic parishes and he immediately became quite popular he literally rebuilt the community and became very powerful in becoming the voice of the voiceless he was truly a very gifted man and i received countless telephone calls and letters from parishioners praising brito for his affection towards the people when i learned that he was not a priest i was taken aback however i must say that if he was never discovered he would be still here with my unconditional support and blessings
2551767 thought he was one of the more devout priests that they had met
2551768 the difference between me and them is that i took the role of a priest very seriously
2551769 no matter what time of day or night i am here for you i am with you in times of great celebration and great sorrow and i am with you at any time day or night many of todays priests become a priest fir the perks and the prestige the power of the white collar is amazing but in my case i worked hard and i helped people believe that a better day was yet ahead despite the current challenges that face all of us as father fred i was genuine and i was very dedicated to the people i was and i became what all priest should be instead many of them only care about not themselves and their own egos and personal benefits that the role brings them when i worked in the parish i gave my heart
2551770 i probably would have made a great priest a great elected official a great human being
2551771 but i screwed it up by making mistakes when i was young which in turn prevented me from becoming the person i had hoped to be
2551772 god came to heal sinners not perfect people and i am one of them
2551773 a lot of people were very upset that i let him go they felt that he was very much an asset to this place
2551774 we really thought he would be able to work his way up and become the next executive director
2551775 he was just energetic and sort of bouncy and a go get em kind of person
2551776 he set huge goals he talked very emphatically and very energetically
2551777 there is no acting involved they get to know me they get to know my passion
2551778 im focused focused focused on my job and i excel in that
2551779 im very very clear as far as to what im doing why im doing it and what my goal is but in the back of my mind i know that at any given moment i could be discovered
2551780 a large amount of it is psyching yourself out to do what youve got to do
2551781 its exhausting having to play a role its exhausting that i cant be just fred but being just fred means unemployed and paying my debt to society for the rest of my life that is what is wrong in our society if you make a mistake and end up in jail or prison that is it you will never be able to get a job and if you do it will never be a job of any real opportunity or with potential advancement
2551782 we ended up fighting to get it cleaned up for over 25 years
2551783 were pretty well satisfied its time to turn it back to god and mother nature
2551784 and well continue to keep an eye on it to make sure its not being abused
2551785 everything would be more efficient and effective if they just withdrew all the programs then they wouldnt have to worry about it would they
2551786 but governments have historically done this because it was good for the country
2551787 a man the other day pointed out that i was never bored i hadnt thought of that before but its true im never bored im appalled horrified angered but never bored the world appears to me so infinite in its variety that many lifetimes could not exhaust its interest so long as you can still be surprised you have something to be thankful for
2551788 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread
2551789 i like to go offensive but if theres baddies i want to be able to defend myself
2551790 we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2551791 it was concluded that ms tomsic and the calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers
2551792 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2551793 the door flew open i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2551794 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2551795 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2551796 they want privacy in their rooms and on the phones
2551797 even if they bellow at the top of their voices
2551798 they will say it is only among my friends and i say do you want to go into law or medicine and do you want this information to come back in 20 years time they say they deleted it and they are unaware that the material still stays around
2551799 this may override any thoughts or concerns about the ramifications of sacrificing privacy
2551800 we were warned back in year 10 about putting pictures of yourself on the internet because people would still be able to see them in the future
2551801 people can google you and your facebook can come up and if they can get on to it and see something inappropriate you could lose out on a job opportunity in the future
2551802 we all realise that if you do upload a picture of yourself someone could look at it in the next second and in the time between you uploading and deleting it that someone could have saved it and sent it on to other people
2551803 we have had a lot of education about it at school and you hear about it on the news
2551804 it is our stuff they dont have any right to snoop
2551805 i believe that many young people are aware or are becoming aware through education about the facts that deleted emails messages and photos can be traced or recovered and that lost privacy cannot be restored
2551806 but the unknown or possible consequences of this may not influence their actions as much as we might hope
2551807 intimacy is much easier to create and less risky in a lot of ways than person to person contact connections with many people or groups can be established quickly it is far easier to join a conversation or ask to be added to a myspace page than to approach a person face to face and risk social rejection to an extent you can control the information that others have about you they cant judge you on your looks if they cant see you
2551808 as teenagers we used to put locks on our diaries so nobody could read them
2551809 i would argue that individuals still have to take personal responsibility for the way they allow others to use their information for example even on facebook you can look at the privacy policy and adjust the settings
2551810 so many young people are exposing themselves in ways that later in life they are going to regret big brother contestants are included that footage is forever and people can record it
2551811 a party might look for the cleanest possible candidate one with the least facebook images
2551812 the older generation has to be careful of making presumptions about the attitudes of youth
2551813 the facebook phenomenon could also be seen as a reflection of the fact that a certain openness about ones private life is now accepted as a fact of life for young people
2551814 no honey thats not alexi lalas alexi may be ineffective but he actually appears competent and updated more quakes galaxy analysis
2551815 it has been a lot of fun but whoever chose my rides at the draw and bbc betting guru angus loughran is the guilty party should never be allowed to eat again
2551816 the racing has been very competitive but i had some good mounts and i got lucky it has been a pleasure to have been involved and to lift both the individual and team trophies is the icing on the cake
2551817 all the jockeys were called into the stewards room before racing and issued with a set of rules which might affect them including those concerning the whip
2551818 sadly baze was found guilty in the very first race of hitting his horse 17 times 12 in the final furlong seven of which he did not give his mount time to respond
2551819 we treat shergar cup day just like any other race meeting there are no separate set of rules and baze clearly transgressed them
2551820 had we allowed him off with a caution we would have been setting a precedent which would have been unacceptable
2551821 i am a little surprised and would have thought i might have got off with a caution
2551822 but things are obviously different over here and i have to accept that
2551823 are you okay your photo fell and i wanted to make sure youre alright
2551824 yeah and there are all the historical buildings and stuff
2551825 the dollar rose this week on the belief the global economic slowdown will depress oil consumption and on slowing growth in europe and in the united kingdom which could lead to interest rate cuts by the ecb and bank of england
2551826 if interest rate cuts are ahead in europe that reduces the attractiveness of the euro and cause investors to reduce positions in the euro which is what we saw happen this week
2551827 that will increase the attractiveness of dollar denominated investments and the dollar will continue to rise
2551828 there have been too many dollar head fakes in this market technically we need to see the euro stay below 1 50 for three straight days and fundamentally we need to see some positive data points for the u s economy including an improvement in gdp growth and the trade deficit
2551829 if and when that occurs then ill be bullish on the dollar
2551830 i feel like i cant complete on jdate because im too religious not girly enough and too left wing
2551831 ive been pretty observant my whole life but i still hate telling people im religious because everyone has some specific idea of what that means and its invariably wrong and or offensive but if i dont tell someone im dating that im religious and then i turn out to be on the third date thats also kind of obnoxious i hear you loud and clear
2551832 i was there where you are a while ago even used jdate which to me is a waste of time and
2551833 so we talked about the fact that im a grad student in middle eastern studies but what do you do
2551834 loves the sox likes to go out with friends and to cook
2551835 the american jewish community is torn right now between its love of israel and its distaste for israels policies
2551836 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2551837 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2551838 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2551839 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2551840 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2551841 a delegation including envoys from the us eu and osce is heading to georgia as its conflict with russia over the breakaway south ossetia region deepens
2551842 yeah we have to send 700 billion to the oil sheiks and what do we get for it we get oil its a deal
2551843 we held out a lot of players that we didnt have to evaluate so there were a lot of chances for younger players i was hoping we would have more depth than we currently have more readiness by some of the younger players that was maybe the striking thing that i took away
2551844 there is some ability but clearly a lot of execution work that needs to happen with our younger players to provide the depth we are going to need i like the athleticisim but right now the assignments have a long ways to go so i think thats going to be our focus through the early part of next week is trying to get our younger players caught up
2551845 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2551846 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2551847 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok
2551848 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2551849 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2551850 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok
2551851 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2551852 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2551853 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2551854 ive got good memories of the community shield i scored the winner in it two years ago we beat chelsea 2 1
2551855 it was in the last 10 minutes craig bellamy whipped a ball in and i was at the back post to head it in i was right by all the liverpool fans and ran to them it was a great feeling
2551856 a few months before in the fa cup final against west ham i scored and it got wrongly disallowed for offside so it was nice to make up for that it was a very competitive game against chelsea we were going at it we played really well that day
2551857 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2551858 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2551859 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok
2551860 it was a tough day of test cricket and tomorrow will be the same
2551861 obviously well be looking at getting as many runs in front as we possibly can and then bowl them out again
2551862 theres still a lot of hard work to be done in this match
2551863 sanga held the innings together all day we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did today
2551864 the concentration he shows batting for long periods of time is what makes him world class he showed that out there today in difficult conditions
2551865 its hard to see how she gets back into the game
2551866 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
2551867 it is unusual for an appellate court to grant a petition for rehearing as this court did in march
2551868 but it is truly remarkable for a court to completely reverse its own earlier opinion we thank you for your prayers and give god the glory for this great victory
2551869 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling
2551870 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2551871 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2551872 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok

2551878 our guys made way more money per dollar than big oil
2551879 how to take names and be taken seriously as a political blogger
2551880 yeah we have to send 700 billion to the oil sheiks and what do we get for it we get oil its a deal
2551881 mad at the other guy cause lots of people like him
2551882 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2551883 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2551884 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2551885 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2551886 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2551887 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2551888 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2551889 the atmosphere was really good everybody telling you go go go ive never had that feeling before
2551890 i came here to achieve a personal victory and for my team and i did that
2551891 our goal was to hit our routines and i think we achieved that im very very pleased with this incredible group of young men
2551892 im hugely proud to ride for my country there is no better feeling than that i dont have the full picture of the situation so i cant comment or speculate
2551893 given an undertaking not to disrupt any of the riders
2551894 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2551895 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2551896 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok
2551897 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2551898 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2551899 i used to have long conversations with the living room wall
2551900 make you laugh like that maybe you never cry again
2551901 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2551902 they dont want to be parents they want to be cool they want to be hip they dont want to be the bad guy
2551903 but guess what being the bad guy is your job
2551904 my mama knew better she wasnt there to make me like her she was there to shape me she was there to make me a good person
2551905 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2551906 but he had been making a living from film and tv appearances for several years starting with a small role in the damon wayans movie mo money in 1992
2551907 my life was slipping away i was missing out on so much stuff with my family and i will never do that again
2551908 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2551909 i ran from my house that cannot contain me from the man that i cannot keep from my mother who haunts me even though shes gone from my daughter that never sleeps i ran from the noise and the silence from the traffic on the streets
2551910 up into the hills i ran to the cemetery and held my breath and thought about your death
2551911 id like to express my extreme point of view im not a christian and im not a jew im just living out the american dream and i just realized that nothing is what it seems

2551915 it has certainly impacted my capabilities as a runner but my focus is on the olympic games i have one aim and i am going to achieve it
2551916 i am going to represent palestine a country that is considered by many to be an irrelevant place
2551917 it is not irrelevant it has people like us educated people it has concerned and educated people and i am going to prove that to them at the olympic games
2551918 one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it it was the black kittens fault entirely

2551935 i regret that ms marois asked athletes to play politics with the flag when they have a competition to concentrate on
2551936 the ioc had no objection to an athlete carrying an official flag
2551937 to one of my best friends and definitely one of my heroes thank you for a real good time with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face for there is nothing left to do but smile smile smile i wish you the fondest farewell you certainly lived longer than you might have but you definitely died sooner than you should have i will miss you terribly have a good trip
2551938 theyre going to give john two more weeks to show what he can do but if he continues his awful play hes out of here
2551939 hes been terrible throughout camp and theres no way four quarterbacks are going to make the final roster hes not one of executive vp of football operations bill parcells guys and they have no loyalty to him
2551940 make you laugh like that maybe you never cry again
2551941 and i say that with motivation because i remember them without any shame without any sorrow without any pity thats what made me
2551942 i always want to top myself i want to get good
2551943 property management got pr0 from pr2 but some of the inner pages got prs like the
2551944 we did dominate and thats something for us to be proud of
2551945 yeah its a great result but we played our hearts out
2551946 i think this was one of the better performances that i have ever seen
2551947 from a focus standpoint from a tactic of discipline from goal scoring chances consistency
2551948 and also we seemed to be by far the fitter team out there and that surprised me a little bit
2551949 just to play in front of that many fans its an amazing experience
2551950 the attention that this sport is getting in the olympics is unbelievable
2551951 i dont think ive ever played in front of this many people its crazy
2551952 i dont think they really had any chances besides their goal and maybe a couple in the last five minutes
2551953 and we had a ton of chances we had the ball in their half for most of the game
2551954 so its frustrating but to tie the host country and it being china one of the best teams in the world you cant really complain
2551955 theyre exhausted were exhausted it was just everyone leaving absolutely everything out on the field just trying to score that last goal
2551956 but i dont have the brain to calculate that at this time
2551957 but my team is an amazing team so it doesnt matter who is on the pitch for us
2551958 we knew that being a sold out stadium it as going to be loud
2551959 but its kind of funny some of us heard them saying china others of us heard them saying canada

2551964 the people in this town have been through so much loss this year and my heart goes out to them
2551965 argues that what mises called praxeology is ultimately rooted in a conception of economic logic that is undeniable and not subject to the claims of those who would extend the idea of
2551966 could not mount device the reported error was no such medium
2551967 if you dont have anything to hide you dont have anything to worry about
2551968 we know theres a million dollar shooter out there waiting to show off his or her skills so we encourage you to leave your business suits behind for the day and join us on the greens
2551969 your support helps positively impact the youth we serve who might not have a chance to advance without our assistance with increased financial resources were able to change the lives of so many deserving children through education and mentoring
2551970 theyre selling out of all the commuting bikes all bikes by the way that they can get their hands on
2551971 we get a lot of service calls for our sidewalks and our streets
2551972 some people think that we only drive cars in this city but more and more people are walking
2551973 people look in neighborhoods they see how they are they see how they feel
2551974 when theyre clean and green people want to stay there they want to move there
2551975 i think its a great idea if they can get it done quicker and do quality work on the streets and the sidewalks
2551976 if you pull them out its highly unlikely were going to have to come back and fix that sidewalk for you
2551977 the role and responsibility of government is to take care of really basic fundamental needs
2551978 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2551979 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2551980 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2551981 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2551982 the iphone s screen is really amazing and it does a great job of making everything look good
2551983 the high resolution is really the key i think especially for 3d games because it makes low polygon count models look much better than they would if viewed on a regular computer monitor
2551984 it really makes it possible to do real games and applications not just trimmed down cell phone apps this devices acts like a gaming platform
2551985 chris is coming over and it will be like a family reunion
2551986 it was weird having him back having someone else in the house i d been solo for 15 months
2551987 we were without kids before the deployment and had a child during the deployment so it was a big adjustment toting around all this baby equipment
2551988 once he blurted out i wish i could go back there instead of being here another time he said something about how i was as hostile as the people over there that wasn t cool
2551989 i was bitter with the military our government and life in general by this point i had been depressed and was just so confused on how to feel how to react
2551990 i felt abandoned and left behind we even talked of divorce or i did i felt like he had given up on me and us and on himself
2551991 that scared me the war has given me new fears and realities
2551992 we got counseling we talked about it in small increments and over many months and years
2551993 it was hard to process it all for him and for me
2551994 if you have a poor experience with one counselor or chaplain don t give up
2551995 find someone else get help you deserve it your marriage deserves it and your kids deserve it sometimes we have to step up to the plate and fight for ourselves
2551996 homecomings are not a fuzzy warm hallmark happy ending movie they can be awkward and painful for some people
2551997 she was right at the 15 month mark we renewed our vows soon after another bundle of joy arrived in our house
2551998 it was a long 15 months of him being gone and a long 15 months of adjustment it was all worth it we did a lot of hard work and fighting for our marriage things will never be the way they were and that is ok many people keep trying to recapture the old days instead of living the new days
2551999 is this the type of man i can expect to attract
2552000 the number of seriously ill new yorkers could climb to 300 000 in the near future
2552001 they are getting sick because of people like christie todd whitman and rudy giuliani
2552002 to understand what is going on you need to follow the money
2552003 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2552004 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2552005 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2552006 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2552007 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2552008 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2552009 the creedal formula quoted in 1 cor 15 3 7 in which the
2552010 what paul preached was never the subject of the controversy between pauls gentile mission and the church in jerusalem jesus death and resurrection was the common event upon which their proclamation was based through the proclamation of this eschatological event the communities of believers became the new israel as new believers came into the community they were baptized in the the death of jesus so they would share also in jesus resurrection
2552011 for what i received i passed on to you as of first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that the appeared to peter then to the twelve
2552012 within this spectrum two points need to be made very clear first though there was a range of belief about live after death the word resurrection was only used to describe reembodiment not the state of disembodied bliss resurrection was not a general word for life after death or going to be with god in some general sense it was the word for what happened when god created newly embodied human beings after whatever intermediate state there might be
2552013 the theology and leadership of women in the new testament
2552014 the lord who will illumine the hidden things of darkness and reveal the councils of the heart
2552015 paul not only alludes to the sayings where were evidently of crucial importance to his opponents he also adopts their schema of revelation which speaks of the things that were formerly hidden but have now been revealed this scheme is characteristic of the q sayings though it is not really typical of the synoptic saying source as a whole in the genuine pauline letters it is used only in 1 cor 2 6 16 while it occurs frequently in the deutero pauline letters and also appears in the secondary ending of romans
2552016 for the corinthian wisdom theology this revelation schema of central importance for their understanding of salvation it related to the sayings tradition by another element namely the recourse to the authority of certain persons paul appeals cephas possibly christ
2552017 they understood particular apostles as their mystagogues from whom they received sayings from which they received life giving wisdom pauls arguments against this understanding of salvation become quite clearer if they are understood against this background
2552018 nowhere else does paul speak about the cross of christ in such terms
2552019 i thank god i did not baptize any of you
2552020 paul does not locate the death and resurrection of christ on earth or in history
2552021 i become all things to all men that i might win some for christ
2552022 it must be remembered that jewish and hellenistic thought both grew up together in the eastern end of the mediterranean both owed a little bit to egypt and a great deal to the civilization of the trigris euphrates valley both alike derived something form aegean culture
2552023 the subject need be considered only at the level of popular misconceptions most of our evidence for the extant mystery cults comes from after the time than that of st paul for example apuleius whose golden ass is one of our sources for these cults wrote in the third quarter of the second century st paul does not seem t have been the sort of man to barrow from pagan sources he was brought up as a strict jew col 2 8 do not let your minds be captured by hollow and deceptive philosophies is a warning against the kind of thinking we find in the mystery religions

2552029 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2552030 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2552031 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2552148 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console square has done games for us in the past and i think theres a point where square just has to look at the xbox 360 the install base and attach rates that were seeing and actually has to make a decision on their own that its the right thing to do for them
2552149 i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360

2552161 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2552162 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2552163 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2552164 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2552165 saakashvili has been trying to internationalize the conflicts in georgia since he has come to office
2552166 it has been very much his strategy to make this an international conflict between the traditional west and russia speaking in language of the cold war and saying that this is really the last frontier hes been racking up those kind of expressions in the past few days but this is really nothing new
2552167 why precisely now what made saakashvili decide that this was the right moment politically in my opinion one of the reasons is that mikheil saakashvili believes the current u s administration has certain obligations toward him and the next presidential administration particularly if this is a democratic administration wont feel it has any these obligations and may modify the overall stance on georgia
2552168 i really think he saakashvili has taken it a step too far because if we were really going to push back the russians you would need something like a military intervention and that is not going to happen
2552169 russia has been trying increase its international legitimacy as a defender of international law not only in the caucasus but also weve been seeing this in the balkans as well with the positions russia has been taking on kosovo it is going to be more difficult for them to stand in front of the security council as the big defender of international law while theyre bombing civilian targets and georgian cities

2552181 this is a way to bring all this information together in a very organized and synthesized way while filtering a lot of noise that might otherwise exist on the web

2552239 over 1 300 people are reported dead after russian forces responded to a georgian attack on rebels in the breakaway province of south ossetia by mounting a full scale invasion
2552240 georgia will withdraw 1 000 soldiers from its military contingent of around 2 000 troops in iraq to help in the fighting against south ossetian separatist rebels a top georgian official said
2552241 when i arrived to work at noon nothing had happened
2552242 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2552243 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2552244 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2552245 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2552246 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2552247 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2552248 sure i am delighted with the result but there is a lot more to come from this group of players
2552249 when they scored we got a foot hold on the match and i was pleased with the character of the lads
2552250 that was the reaction i was looking for and knowing the lads as i do i never had any doubt that would be their response
2552251 he needs to learn the shape and the system but it was a great debut from him
2552252 he was our penalty taker in the absence of the injured martin rowlands and practiced yesterday
2552253 he scored five out of five in training and ill have no problems with him taking another for us
2552254 this victory is a small step on a long road its a long season and were one out of one on a 46 game ladder
2552255 we had a fantastic start to the game with a great finish by iain hume we could have had another one or two we were very pleased with what we saw today
2552256 we had a bad five minutes and conceded twice from set pieces which was disappointing you have to give credit to qpr because they did well in those five minutes although the first one came from a very dubious free kick
2552257 there was only one team in it in the second half we took the game to them and there was only one side out there there was nothing in it we have come here and had the lions share of the play we were the better team
2552258 we have not won the game which is very disappointing for everybody but there were a lot of positives we are obviously disappointed with the result but we can take a lot from that performance
2552259 it was never a penalty but luke steele saved it anyway i have no complaints though about the sending off
2552260 it always surprises me when people dont want to be positive and instead write negative stories im a positive person
2552261 we have high profile owners here and the tag of favourites is going to stay but we have to embrace that and tackle it head on
2552262 barnsley played well and defensively we were too open we were a little bit too gung ho
2552263 but in the end we got a win out of a potentially difficult situation it says a lot about the character of the team
2552264 we got the job done without being great im not going to pretend otherwise its a result were delighted with without getting carried away
2552265 its a small step on a long road for us its the first rung on a 46 rung ladder
2552266 we had a fantastic start iain hume finished well and we could maybe have scored one or two more
2552267 in the second half there was only one team in it we took the game to them qpr have spent a lot of money and i felt we not only had the lions share we were actually the better side
2552268 im disappointed with the result but in terms of the performance there were good things to come out of it and well take that and move on
2552269 were a stronger squad than we were last season and we will be a better team
2552270 theres always pressure when you sign a striker for over 1million and theres pressure on iain hume so it was good to see him score
2552271 why people fight and die for a few square meters yards of land why
2552272 the world powers dont see the situation in the north caucasus
2552273 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2552274 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2552275 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas

2552281 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2552282 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2552283 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout

2552300 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2552301 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2552302 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2552303 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2552304 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2552313 martinez litters his tracks with more melodies per square inch than any rapper on the planet once he gets his hooks in you hell never let go
2552314 magnetising audiences with his ridiculous stage presence and inimitable joie de vivre josh martinezs is a legitimate underground success
2552315 his latest album midriff music is an opus of anthemic rap music bullying topics all over the schoolyard pushing the envelope of acceptable hiphop behavior and making one of the best rap albums at the same time
2552316 midriff music is a must have going from banger to anthem to summer jam and back again this album showcases a colossal display of songwriting prowess with martinez guiding the feel and flow with effortless ease
2552317 the best rhyme writer in the city buck up princess is josh martinezs crowning achievement a sprawling epic that finds him indulging in the many sides of his personality the road weary battler the tipsy raconteur the passionate social critic and the lovelorn romantic
2552318 though comparisons can be made both lyrically and conceptually martinez proves himself to one of hiphops best
2552319 youth may indeed be wasted on the young but according to josh martinez retirement is wasted on the elderly the halifax native is one of the best hip hop artists in canada an articulate entertainer whose career has been driven by a single motivating theme the unabashed pursuit of happiness

2552329 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2552330 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2552331 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2552332 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2552333 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader

2552357 there is an assumption that maybe now that smith is gone and the grizz still have loads of cap space perhaps they would consider taking zach randolph from the knicks the grizzlies do have size with darko milicic and marc gasol but neither are legit low post scorers like z bo can be he would fit with rudy gay as a good 1 2 punch at the forward spots even with adding randolph the grizzlies would still be under the 71 million luxury tax threshold but over the 58 million salary cap the knicks would likely take back at least one salary in any trade and it might have to be a milicic 14 5 million with two years left or one of the plethora of guards javaris crittenton or kyle lowry could be available but what the knicks should do is see if the grizzlies would part with hakim warrick just because hes athletic and long and cheap quite frankly however a z bo to memphis deal isnt likely in my opinion i think the knicks are more likely to take randolph into the season and try to get the most out of the 20 10 guy and see if his value goes up then see what they could fetch for him at the trade deadline

2552486 im running a more grassroots door to door campaign this year
2552487 ive walked over 500 miles so far thousands of homes that ive been to
2552488 its alarming that so many people have given up on democracy and just say when they come to the door i cant stand it anymore go away im not registered i dont vote in fact thats one of the reasons im running for office for me both major parties have been derelict in their leadership to put it mildly
2552489 i can say what i need to say you dont get anywhere with the two major parties unless you sell yourself to them i was willing to do that in 2006 because i still believed in their message and that they were serious about getting us out of iraq i really did i was take in i was very angry when pelosi took all of that off the table it was the clincher for me the democrats dont want people who think for themselves they want people who they can control just like the republicans do people who think for themselves dont make it in the two major parties
2552490 im not going there to be miss congeniality im going there to help my country and to help the people of this district im not going there to whore myself out or to be anybodys ass kisser im going to do the things i need to do to satisfy my own conscience and work for the well being of our people im not going to be like kathy dahlkemper kathy dahlkemper is an idiot she cant speak four coherent sentences in a row shes a woman who doesnt believe in choice but shes well packaged and shes exactly what the democrats want someone they can lead by the nose

2552493 our people have been working here many for over 20 years and are extremely competent and able to do the work synagro wants to do this bribery scandal gives us the opportunity to undo this contract
2552494 if the city council has any self respect left at all
2552495 we ought not to be rewarding people for inappropriate conduct
2552496 i never met rayford jackson didnt even know what he looked like until i saw his picture in the paper it is absolutely untrue
2552497 the no bid contract with this murderous war profiteer should never have been considered
2552498 it will cost the city 47 million a year for 25 years with a five year instant extension it will cost more for the city to add additional lime to the sludge for the synagro process the city will pay all utilities and there is a built in cost of living increase of 2 5 percent a year
2552499 by taking synagro private in an april 2007 leveraged buyout worth 772 million carlyle is able to avoid requirements that synagro provide to the public shareholders and federal agencies such as the sec certain information about its business practices
2552500 as a result of the buy out synagro may no longer be required to disclose publicly the existence of regulatory inquiries or legal complaints against the company resulting from health hazards caused by synagro products and product distribution private equity buyout firms such as the carlyle group are not required to publicly disclose information about the business practices of the companies they own
2552501 we know former dwsd director victor mercado his whole reputation is based on privatizing government entities nation wide the city has gone on record that we dont want to privatize our water department or our lightning system and that is also against the law

2552506 la idea de escribir trampa en el hielo me lleg por una experiencia personal muy similar a la que cuento en el libro un d a mi marido recibi una carta de una chica que dec a que era su hija
2552507 fue una experiencia muy emocional y adem s bastante siniestra pero me llev a pensar aqu hay una gran historia para un thriller psicol gico
2552508 no puedes pasarte toda la vida en movimiento a la larga se necesita un poco de pausa
2552509 los personajes que creo son una amalgama de los pacientes que he tenido en el pasado eso me permite darles una personalidad muy detallada porque un psicoanalista llega a conocer a sus pacientes de una forma muy ntima acaba conoci ndolos mejor que sus parejas

2552511 ellos plantearon 83 millones a lo mejor ellos se confundieron porque son dos remesas de platas las que le planteamos ayer una referida a un decreto de 83 millones y otro de 841 millones entonces ah estamos cubriendo todos los problemas que ellos han manifestado respecto del mantenimiento del servicio
2552512 nosotros queremos seguir en una mesa de trabajo para resolver cada uno de los puntos de su petitorio pero no entendemos la raz n de la movilizaci n porque tenemos la mesa abierta y cada uno de los puntos que ellos presentaron estaban resueltos
2552513 it was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures
2552514 the last couple of days ive been checking the registrations myself on the computer
2552515 the meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism
2552516 est tudo certo estou feliz pelo fato de o werder bremen compreender que estar em pequim era o que eu desejava
2552517 terminar con la arrogancia de quienes se cre an intocables
2552518 el mejor homenaje que le podemos hacer es que el pa s incorpore para siempre en su acervo tico el valor de los derechos humanos
2552519 juan fue perseguido por sus ideas juan bustos fue v ctima de la barbarie organizada del estado y hoy d a es el estado pero aquel ahora reencontrado con sus verdaderas tradiciones y su esencia libertaria la que le rinde honores y despide como autoridad democr tica porque los honores de estado hay que merecerlos y juan bustos ciertamente los merece
2552520 fue decisivo para derribar para siempre en chile el muro de la impunidad para terminar con la arrogancia de quienes se cre an intocables para consolidar nuestra democracia
2552521 el pa s extra ar la presencia de juan bustos nos debemos sentir orgullosos porque son pocas las veces en que la autoridad se compenetra tanto con la virtud y juan bustos sin duda era un hombre virtuoso
2552522 i dont know if the green jersey makes a whole hill of beans
2552523 when we do our non tackling contact drills its hard for him not to get run into or to bump into somebody going through the line
2552524 knowshon is not the type of guy to go to the trainer and say my shoulder hurts a little bit
2552525 yeah i thought about it for a brief moment but i decided i needed more time to process everything
2552526 i got to watch practice and meet a lot of the players my mom loved it down there too if shes comfortable with everything then that makes me feel good thats very important to me
2552527 i assume georgia is telling me the truth either way it wouldnt matter to me its just an honor to be recruited by the no 1 team in the country i feel very fortunate to be in the position i am in and hopefully it will all work out
2552528 we could have put the pads on today but you cant tackle so we decided to leave them off
2552529 if you put the pads on and cant tackle sometimes the guys get confused so we just left them off until today
2552530 when the vikings drafted moss i told brad johnson richts brother in law and former fsu quarterback to quicken up your drop plant your feet and throw it as high and far as you can and hell get it
2552531 stafford patted the ball once or twice on a deep ball and didnt get it to him
2552532 its hard for him not to get run into or bump into somebody while hes trying to break through the line
2552533 when hes working tonys drills and hes running through the blaster or just any kind of drill where he might practice pass protection tony can tell hes favoring that side
2552534 knowshon is not the kind of guy whos going to go to the trainer and say my shoulder is hurt its up to the coaches discretion on something like that
2552535 the good news is nobody got hurt today so you dont have to ask me anything about that
2552536 hes not the type of guy who is going to go to the trainer and say my shoulder hurts coach tony ball saw it in drills yesterday its hard for knowshon to avoid contact or bump into something during drills he will be fine
2552537 right now we want to find the best five up front and ben jones and cordy glenn are fighting for playing time and a starting position
2552538 rambo has given us a spark lately and dowtin had a nice day today too
2552539 hes able to run our defense a lot better because he has the experience of going through our spring and fall last year he still needs more consistency hes got a ways to go but he just needs more practice

2552547 hace diez a os era inimaginable que un creador pudiera vivir de su arte hoy es una realidad al menos para diez grandes fot grafos claro que los museos argentinos todav a no acostumbran a pagar por fotos recurren a donaciones para armar colecciones
2552548 aunque la fotograf a directa exige im genes sin modificar recortes de la realidad parte de la fotograf a contempor nea hace del fot grafo un director un escen grafo un dise ador y hasta un performer
2552549 su valor actual est asentado en que es un modelo para comprender el mundo la fotograf a crea un pensamiento distinto de la pintura
2552550 est m s relacionada con la literatura que con la pintura los colores blanco y negro son herramientas expresivas
2552551 yo creo que estamos cosechando una siembra que viene por lo menos de la d cada de 1980 recuerdo la muestra del per odo 1860 1960 que se hizo en el palais de glace o aquellas jornadas de fotograf a buenos aires la plata que en 1988 organizamos con facundo zuvir a

2552555 we are delighted to be part of the nationwide launch of guitar hero on tour and to be assisting such a leading player in the worldwide games industry
2552556 it is a matter of life and death a road to game over or to win
2552557 i tell you which one i would want i want the mass effect one
2552558 a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next mass effect game
2552559 la creencia de que todos ser n salvos muchos grupos ense an la doctrina del universalismo desde diferentes perspectivas algunos protestantes y cat licos liberales intentan basarlo en la escritura notando que cristo muri por todos y que el castigo eterno es incoherente con un dios de amor y misericordia que desea que todos sean salvos
2552560 y yo jes s si fuere levantado de la tierra a todos atraer a mi mismo
2552561 as qu como por la transgresi n de uno vino la condenaci n a todos los hombres de la misma manera por la justicia de uno vino a todos los hombres la justificaci n de vida
2552562 porque el amor de cristo nos constri e pensando esto que si uno muri por todos luego todos murieron
2552563 dios el cual quiere que todos los hombres sean salvos y vengan al conocimiento de la verdad
2552564 el se or no retarda su promesa seg n algunos la tienen por tardanza sino que es paciente para con nosotros no queriendo que ninguno perezca sino que todos procedan al arrepentimiento

2552573 i really think that participating in the study influenced the patients remission
2552574 this study is going to receive a lot of attention and it will create a desire on behalf of a patient population that is suffering and hoping for a magic bullet
2552575 if the question is did we find enough information to support exploring this further then we got some interesting findings which support the need for a proper controlled study
2552576 im concerned that the study only measured effects up to 24 hours and ocd is a chronic condition not measurable in hours and days but months and years
2552577 about 12 of people can suffer flashbacks after less than 10 exposures to psychedelics many years later beyond the six months of this study so long term effects should be carefully assessed
2552578 if this substance was effective and had fewer side effects in severe treatment resistant case it would be an option
2552579 you would expect a spontaneous remission rate of 10 within in a year
2552580 the overwhelming number of banks including those headquartered here in oregon are safe and sound
2552581 oregons banks are well capitalized and have adequate reserves to address economic challenges banks are and continue to be the safest place for deposits
2552582 west coast bank has been serving its communities since 1925 and we continue to be strong and financially sound
2552583 we have earned the highest possible credit rating from both moodys investors service and standard amp poors ratings services
2552584 one of the best measures of our capital strength is our return on equity how effectively we use our shareholders investment in our stock its consistently one of the best in the business
2552585 wells fargo also is one of the best capitalized large u s bank holding companies in the country our capital ratios are among the strongest in our peer group
2552586 we have been helping customers succeed financially since 1852 well continue to be here to provide the financial services our community needs
2552587 thousands of lives have been blighted by the rampant and powerful stigma surrounding mental health problems
2552588 in the days of victorian asylums people were shut away by bricks and mortar at the end of the century people with mental health problems are excluded by prejudice alone
2552589 these people were doctors health service workers managers office workers and teachers they had little in common except that as soon as they received their diagnosis their world changed not because of their condition but because they had been marked as mad people
2552590 people lost access to financial services courts denied them access to their children as if to rub salt into the wound social exclusion resulting from psychiatric diagnosis is even excluded from the governments own social exclusion unit seu
2552591 it is easier to live with a prison record than a psychiatric record
2552592 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field

2552598 father mother god please take me as an instrument of your will
2552599 i love the atmosphere here and i dont mind waiting in line sometimes i like waiting in line just to work the line
2552600 were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2552601 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2552602 just checking to see if you know anything or can help us at all with the in laws of the volleyball coach who was attacked today we think they are from minnesota im sure you know whats going on by now
2552603 a chinese man attacked two u s tourists killing one and a chinese tour guide on saturday in a rare attack on foreigners in beijing site of the 2008 olympic games
2552604 tang yongming 47 from the eastern city of hangzhou jumped to his death from the second story of popular tourist spot the drum tower after the incident xinhua news agency cited a beijing city government spokesman as saying xinhua did not give a motive for the attack
2552605 the united states olympic committee has learned of an incident that occurred earlier today involving two family members of a coach for the united states olympic mens indoor volleyball team
2552606 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured following the attack the assailant took his own life
2552607 the coach is married to a former volleyball player from minnesota
2552608 and now you know the rest of the story good day
2552609 this is tremendous news for the city of bridgeport first it says the court has recognized that the racism that was present in the bridgeport police department in the 1970s is indeed a thing of the past
2552610 the impact of this will be that we will be able to control our own police department a move that will help us fight crime more effectively while simultaneously saving the money the city has been paying the special master since 1983
2552611 i made the resolution of the guardians case a top priority when i took office as mayor in december since then i have become deeply involved in the case
2552612 racism has no place in bridgeport and we will continue our efforts to make sure that all bridgeport
2552613 allows the office of the chief to continue to foster relationships with department personnel and the community at large and allow the department to further reflect the community

2552616 hablar de juan bustos es hablar de justicia y derecho quiz s el mejor penalista de los ltimos tiempos
2552617 el mejor homenaje que le podemos hacer es perseguir en nuestro quehacer publico esa misma virtud que fue cardinal en toda su vida
2552618 fui su amigo y soy su disc pulo y a la labor de defender los derechos humanos enfocar mis esfuerzos
2552619 perdemos un hombre eminente dejamos hoy seguramente a lo mejor que el socialismo fue capaz de entregar en el mbito jur dico a chile y al mundo
2552620 hoy somos m s libres porque juan bustos un hombre pac fico fue capaz de ganar una batalla en el mbito del derecho
2552621 logr conjugar en su vida la audacia de un revolucionario y la libertad e un dem crata
2552622 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2552623 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2552624 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2552625 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2552626 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2552627 nuestros atletas en pek n han decidido expresar su protesta pero como todo el mundo sabe acorde con la norma ol mpica esto est prohibido y la consecuencia es la descalificaci n de todos modos han querido de cualquier forma protestar y la decisi n ha sido la de abandonar los juegos

2552636 in the patterns instruction there are also diagrams and instructions on how to make this special embroidery stitch but there are small details that are missed and are only discovered when one is actually trying to sew this stitch i made three attempts tests before feeling confident on trying this stitch on the dress and the pictures try to illustrate the way that works for me when stitching when you begin or when you have to re thread the needle you should always start with the thread coming out from the hem edge take a few small stitches in the same place to secure the thread end then insert the needle on the braid from the underside to outside but dont pull the needle all the way out i position the needle like this pointing upwards and right next to where the thread is coming out from the hem edge the next step is wrapping the thread that comes out of the hem around the needle for eleven times keep the thread taught and gently move the wrapping together with your fingernail using your thumb and forefinger to hold the wrap pull the needle and the thread slowly through the wrap keep the fingers in place while pulling and avoid tangling the thread give a final pull so the bullion is tight and even insert the needle right at the height of the bullion passing it in between the dress and the hem facing and pulling it out approximately at 1 2
2552637 im really looking forward to spending some time with my family having a chance to see my grandma

2552656 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2552657 rcp is denied through the connected interface update cannot proceed
2552658 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2552659 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2552660 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2552661 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2552662 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2552663 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2552665 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2552666 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2552667 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2552668 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2552669 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2552670 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2552671 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2552672 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2552673 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2552674 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2552675 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2552676 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2552677 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2552678 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2552679 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2552680 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2552681 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2552682 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2552683 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2552684 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2552685 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2552686 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2552687 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2552688 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2552689 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2552690 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2552691 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2552692 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2552693 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2552694 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2552695 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2552696 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2552697 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2552698 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2552699 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2552700 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2552701 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2552702 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2552703 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2552704 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2552705 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2552706 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2552707 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2552708 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2552709 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2552710 in the telephone intercepts they always were extremely satisfied when someone blew himself up
2552711 these are people who were radicalized in the west and declared themselves ready to become martyrs for jihad
2552712 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2552713 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2552714 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2552715 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2552719 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2552720 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2552721 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2552722 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2552723 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2552724 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2552725 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2552726 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2552727 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2552728 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2552732 protestamos vivamente contra las declaraciones que dicen que el proceso democr tico es tranquilizador cuando estamos en un pa s donde el presidente elegido democr ticamente est en la c rcel y el poder en manos de los golpistas que reprimen nuestras manifestaciones

2552740 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2552741 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2552742 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2552743 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2552744 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2552745 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2552746 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed

2552765 while obama offered a response largely in line with statements issued by democratically elected world leaders including president bush first calling on both sides to negotiate john mccain took a remarkably and uniquely more aggressive stance siding clearly with georgias pro western leaders and placing the blame for the conflict entirely on russia
2552766 both american candidates back georgias sovereignty and its turn toward the west but their first statements on the crisis revealed differences of substance and style

2552890 estas p ldoras act an impidiendo la ovulaci n y no son abortivas
2552891 est garantizada su distribuci n como se viene haciendo en el marco del programa nacional de salud sexual y procreaci n responsable y de acuerdo con las leyes vigentes
2552892 al pibe que le encuentran droga lo encarcelan y se lo compara con un traficante
2552893 poner en funcionamiento el primero de setiembre el sistema de declaraci n jurada
2552894 aquello que no se pueda controlar con el cruce de datos se va a hacer a trav s de las fiscalizaciones
2552895 puede suceder que haya falta de comprensi n de las reglas o desconocimiento de las mismas por otro lado muchos est n metidos en una cabalgata deportiva de la cr tica sin poder mirar hacia delante
2552896 el 17 de abril fue la denominada mesa de enlace la que firm un acuerdo con el gobierno para que se autoricen 550 000 toneladas en el a o y nosotros reitero ya autorizamos 330 000 me da la impresi n que hablar de goteo en las autorizaciones de roe rojo es un poco exagerado
2552897 no hay que confundir cumplimiento de normas con trabas no hay que confundir sostener mecanismos que tiendan gradualmente a llevar a un sector de la econom a argentina hacia un mayor proceso de transparencia y formalidad con sostener por el contrario una defensa de la informalidad
2552898 no lo que ocurre en la pr ctica es que muchas veces el exportador no termina embarcando la cantidad de mercader a que se le autoriz a exportar esto en la operaci n de comercio exterior es normal siempre se exporta menos cantidad de la que efectivamente se compromete
2552899 muy valorable el gesto de las autoridades de la oncca de prestarse a debatir a considerar temas y hablar con el sector privado
2552900 yo los recibo en estos foros les he dicho que as como est n invitadas todas las entidades representativas del agro a estos foros ellos tambi n tienen la posibilidad de participar
2552901 what i want for my 60th birthday is the chance to provide medical dental and nursing care to all and absolutely nothing else
2552902 clinical responsibility rests with the nhs professional who makes the decision to refer and who
2552903 oh well but in my experience i have found this useful for some of my patients
2552904 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2552905 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2552906 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2552907 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2552908 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2552909 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2552910 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2552911 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2552912 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2552913 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move
2552914 but after seeing the first two heats i kind of wanted to be the top seed going into tomorrow and thats all i went out and did
2552915 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2552916 that was my best morning uhh prelim swim so im happy with it
2552917 but im sure going give him a run for his money
2552918 im going to have a double shot of espresso tomorrow morning
2552919 i think thats the first time hes worn a jammer in two years
2552920 i hope to talk him into something that will cover more of his body
2552921 i dont want to be the center of attention going into the final
2552922 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2552923 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2552924 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2552925 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2552926 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2552927 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2552928 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2552929 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2552930 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2552931 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2552932 oh yeah i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2552933 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2552934 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2552935 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2552936 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2552937 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2552938 el presidente nunca minti en lo dicho sobre operaci n jaque
2552939 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2552940 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2552941 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2552942 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
2552943 in meinen zw lf jahren als profi hatte ich eine ausnahmegenehmigung f r das mittel syndicort diese lief aus die neue genehmigung bezieht sich auf das mittel becotide
2552944 awesome opportunity to turn out the votes lets do it philly style
2552945 maybe i can save up to buy a pack of gum
2552946 it takes a lot of money to look this cheap
2552947 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2552948 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2552949 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2552950 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2552951 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2552952 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2552953 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2552954 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2552955 the threat here is everything from terrorists to criminals to crazies
2552956 our security is multilayered and weve had to think of every eventuality
2552957 most of the american team is not staying at the olympic village but at a well guarded university campus
2552958 here theyre staying here and were guarding their compound but we are allowing them to have their own security
2552959 the problem is not that we have become too strict the problem is before there were practically no restrictions or control at all
2552960 it was out of control anyone could enter china and we had to bring this under reasonable control
2552961 if there will be a serious decision to end the occupation of iraq those cells will vanish
2552962 there will be no reason to let those cells stay and work
2552963 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to help the iraqi people
2552964 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2552965 the man fell about 300 meters 980 feet the woman fell too but her rope got caught on a rock so she fell about 70 80 meters 230 260 feet
2552966 but anywhere can be dangerous when the weather turns and it snows and theres fog
2552967 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2552968 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2552969 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2552970 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2552971 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2552972 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2552973 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2552974 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2552975 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2552976 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2552977 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2552978 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2552979 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2552980 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2552981 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2552982 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2552983 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2552984 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2552985 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2552986 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2552987 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2552988 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2552989 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2552990 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2552991 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2552992 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2552993 nuestros atletas en pek n han decidido expresar su protesta pero como todo el mundo sabe acorde con la norma ol mpica esto est prohibido y la consecuencia es la descalificaci n de todos modos han querido de cualquier forma protestar y la decisi n ha sido la de abandonar los juegos

2552996 shannen dohertys first day is right now actually shes shooting
2552997 i cant wait to meet shannen i really like her
2552998 they kind of made my character a little like the girl who thinks shes kelly taylor spoiled little rich girl
2552999 i am fine how are things going at the compound
2553000 again long story you need to return as soon as possible
2553001 vandall i dont want to reveal too much but i really need to know
2553002 no it will be permanently deleted so we can talk freely if you wish
2553003 it may appear to some readers that i gave ample and perhaps na ve credence to the prisoners points of view
2553004 its still not clear to me what i am being charged with
2553005 the supreme court the personalities and rivalries that defined america
2553006 lo estamos haciendo verdaderamente con un m nimo de recursos si en la primera fase de los nueve estados se gastaron 4 millones 250 mil pesos en esta si gastamos la mitad es mucho es un trabajo de voluntad
2553007 all my fans are harry potter fans because everyone is a harry potter fan
2553008 could cross the room in a second and break his neck before he could get a spell word out
2553009 yeah blahblahblah something about her being a part of the story and how the publishers wanted only 3 books and she couldnt fit nessie in only 3 books bullshit
2553010 oh thats cool kind of like how bella was fighting for her
2553011 i knew who i had to kill but i didnt want to go there i thought about it just couldnt do it
2553012 im not good with answering questions that havent been answered in the novels already
2553013 have you always known the werewolves were shapeshifters or was it just something that came about in the middle of the series
2553014 i still think of them as werewolves because really whats the definition of a werewolf a man turns into a wolf and back but i knew their backstory i hadnt defined it entirely but i knew where it came from and i knew it had been a different story if they had been bitten by a traditional werewolf
2553015 theres no moral of the story the point is to have a good time the message is did you enjoy the ride hopefully because thats what it was about it was about having fun and entertainment and nothing beyond that was intentional
2553016 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2553017 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2553018 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2553019 all the things wed done so well in the last 18 months we forgot
2553020 hes got big boots to fill but hes certainly started the right way
2553021 hes so calm and hes got such a good head and hes pretty streetwise for his age
2553022 theres still a lot of cricket to play but we are in a good position
2553023 we are still ahead and they are two wickets down it will be important to come back early tomorrow and put them under pressure
2553024 thats not the point the point is that i have a constitutional right to privacy
2553025 the sun actually rises in the west not in the east
2553026 memmmmories like the corners of my mind misty water colored memmmories of the way we were
2553027 keep a stiff upper lip there liz and just keep humming tammy wynettes stand by your man this will disappear quicker than obamas lead in the gallup poll
2553028 im sick and tired of politicians giving us lectures about family values
2553029 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2553030 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2553031 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2553032 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2553033 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2553034 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking
2553035 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2553036 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2553037 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2553038 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2553039 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2553040 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2553058 because the first recorded sith to use the title were darth revan and darth malak the fact that they derived much of their power from the star forge a creation of the rakata has led some historians to suggest that
2553059 if this doesnt work out i can always get divorced
2553060 is one of a small number of threats that has the potential to hold our society seriously at risk and might result in defeat of our military forces
2553061 this alarming report clears the way for congress to debate more seriously the most effective measures to meet the threat of an emp attack
2553062 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2553063 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2553064 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2553065 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2553066 create a single standard of high quality comprehensive and preventive health care for all
2553067 allow freedom of choice of physician hospital and other health care providers
2553068 eliminate financial barriers that prevent families and individuals from obtaining the medically necessary care they need
2553069 ive never designed for this siiiiiiize eyes roll i guess ill drape
2553070 surrealism you keep using this word i do not think it means what you think it means
2553071 students and families have less obvious choices right now theyre going to have to look at circumstances and try to come up with alternative financing options if they have utilized this as their main option or only option in the past
2553072 for the second consecutive month total receipts exceeded the most recent estimates while state spending was less than anticipated
2553073 this gives us every reason to believe that the state can continue to pay its bills into the month of october while maintaining a reasonable cash cushion it also pushes back the timetable for external borrowing that may be needed to maintain the states cash flow
2553074 while the states cash position has improved it has not eliminated the need for an expensive and risky wall street borrowing later this year
2553075 the only way to avoid the risk of running out of cash is to quickly enact a budget that addresses the states chronic structural deficit
2553076 i received a telephone call last night thursday telling me i was the next to die
2553077 we will not give up we will not let the insecurity prevent us from helping somali people who are in urgent need of aid
2553078 it seems there is an anti aid worker campaign going on in the afgoye area it looks like the attackers want the aid workers expelled from the region for insecurity to reign
2553079 kariye was one of those who organised the protests over the increase in attacks on aid workers he may have become a target as a result
2553080 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2553081 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2553082 the death of tens of civilians in bomb and mortar attacks in mogadishu in the past week the current massive displacement of civilians due to fighting in beletweyne and the latest killing of an aid worker underline the toll conflict is taking on civilian populations and the relief operation
2553083 all this is occurring in the context of a severely deteriorating humanitarian situation in which aid workers themselves subject to attacks in increasing numbers are more and more challenged to reach people with the assistance they require
2553084 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2553085 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
2553086 drought has dried bushes and plants which naturally resist the flow of water to some extent it has also hardened the land and made it less absorbent
2553087 even when there is light rain it fast turns into instant flooding because of several factors resulting from drought
2553088 summer temperatures have been high and are forecast to remain above normal in many lowland areas these high temperatures increase water evaporation affecting water availability for the autumn september and october planting season particularly for winter wheat
2553089 this coupled with high food prices and ongoing conflict has contributed to deteriorating food security
2553090 the exploitation of ill people who are helpless in the face of the demand to inform and report on their relatives acquaintances and others constitutes intolerable intimidation and a moral problem of serious magnitude
2553091 you will not be able to receive treatment in israel if you dont give us additional information

2553095 it is much to raucous i can barely hear myself think you know
2553096 i doubt you have anything of any import to think about mdear
2553097 listen mlady there is nothing untoward going on here i am merely celebrating st georges day with a few friends you are more than welcome to join us if you wish it is an entirely proper affair i assure you
2553098 entirely proper you say hah it seems like an extremely debauched gathering and i for one will not be party to it
2553099 my castle just happens to be exceptionally jubilant and filled with half naked ladies
2553100 why if only my poor late husband were still with us he would not stand for this at all
2553101 it must be hard living alone never feeling the gentle caress of a lover never again to be held in a mans powerful arms never to feel his smooth solid shaft thrusting between your legs
2553102 i look into your eyes mdear and all i see is pain and suffering there is a hole in your heart that longs to be filled and a hole between your legs that demands the same come my lady let me be the one who fills you
2553103 i do miss a bit of the other i must say
2553104 then say no more actions speak louder than words after all
2553105 i know that dogs are pack animals but it is difficult to imagine a pack of standard poodles and if there was such a thing as a pack of standard poodles where would they rove to bloomingdales
2553106 when i got the call this morning it was just x17 online
2553107 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2553108 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2553109 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2553123 t he game of bait and switch that todays opinion plays upon the nations commander in chief will make the war harder on us it will certainly cause more americans to be killed that consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time honored legal principle vital to our constitutional republic but it is this courts blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today

2553141 each situation would apply for borrowers who are in a position where they need to minimize their monthly payments perhaps they are a recent graduate who has just entered the work force
2553142 make sure they have your current address you dont want to miss the bills
2553143 sallie mae offers an interest rate discount when you pay on time there are no pre payment penalties
2553144 the consequences of default are significant and could include a tarnished credit rating garnishment of pay and the inability to obtain additional aid and future credit
2553145 in addition legal action can be taken to recover unpaid loan balances and fees if borrowers are experiencing trouble meeting their obligation they should contact the department of education at 1 800 4fedaid or their lender directly
2553146 the last thing the department wants is for a borrower to go into default and force us to collect on the loan borrowers experiencing difficulties in making payments should contact their lender or the department and we will work with them
2553147 remaining in an active current repayment status is in the best interest of the borrower and the department
2553148 it was just a phone call it was easy i asked for it and they said ok they asked some questions i was honest
2553149 when i consolidated i had paid five years into my cycle but now i have another 10 years to pay it off so instead of paying it off for 10 years its 15 if i didnt consolidate id only have three years of payments left
2553150 when you consolidate you cant unconsolidate and in many cases you cannot reconsolidate so its very very important to get expert advice
2553151 consolidation may be a very reasonable option for students however we do not recommend one simple solution for all students
2553152 consolidation is something to be considered on an individual basis and the decision to consolidate should be contingent on many factors
2553153 really budget your educational costs before taking out student loans many students decide to take out loans before fully exploring available grants and scholarships each year billions of dollars in scholarships from various sources go unspent because of the lack of applicants
2553154 students and parents who take the time to make realistic college budgets and payment plans will usually find innovative ways to pay for college without taking out huge amounts in loans
2553155 we always consider student loans to be good debt versus bad debt because of what they offer very competitive interest rates deferment and forbearance and the flexible repayment options
2553156 i understand debt a lot better this time around because ive lived it
2553157 once you lower the payment or increase the term a 25 000 loan can end up costing 40 000
2553158 as soon as you get promoted or earn more you should send in more money or switch to a standard plan
2553159 youre going to be making a payment that is even higher than the one you were uncomfortable making the year before
2553160 are you amp amp insane well look like completely cruel jackasses
2553161 i dont like your socks they offended me im suing you for intent to cause emotional distress you should have known i cant handle fuscia and argyle together

2553163 its gratifying to see concrete results at advancing the economic and social foundations of lebanon thorough intels work with the us and lebanese private sectors
2553164 access to education and technology increases the opportunities for the people of lebanon
2553165 the nabatiyeh beirut telemedicine program could not come at a better time
2553166 since last summer there has been an increase in eye and skin problems due mainly to crowding particularly among the residents of south lebanon now we can bring medical expertise to more people and faster than before
2553167 the average opinion of the users of this site should go on to push companies into behaving a certain way
2553168 the companies being targeted disney mattel the gap and so on may not always be the worst offenders but they do tend to be the ones who flash their logos in bright lights on the global marquee
2553169 its terrible conditions in the nike factory are so awful we think either the nike factory should shut down or we shouldnt buy goods from this nike factory
2553170 i wont put my money where my mouth is but ill point a gun at you so you have no choice but to put your money where my mouth is
2553171 the goal of a site like this is to cut through false claims to positive impact by allowing the masses to get wide angled perspective on every public move by companies
2553172 make our crap cheaply while ignoring decent workplace wages safety health and environmental regulations
2553173 its imperative for open communication that the face is revealed
2553174 you must be the change you want to see in the world
2553175 do the right thing is adding to the misguided perception that corporations rather than governments have a duty to address the worlds problems and speeding up the process by which corporations respond to consumers with phony
2553176 it is true the kpu has no obligation to publish the preliminary list of voters but if they had vision and good preparation they could have made public a national list of voters on their website
2553177 any delay in preparations will affect the budget for electoral logistics including the procurement of ballot papers
2553178 we cant force them to do so what we are doing now is making sure that each local election body kpud releases a preliminary list of voters in its area before aug 14
2553179 we have a month to update the list of voters i have received reports from many areas that the provisional lists of voters have been made public in several remote villages
2553180 it is the most up to date data we have we have not yet updated it as demanded by the kpu
2553181 we are not required to release the preliminary list of voters the kpu only needs to release the final list of voters
2553182 dunkin donuts espresso based beverages will only use fair trade certifiedtm coffee beans
2553183 a recent upgrade to yahoo messenger includes an innocuous auto update option when the user gives yahoo permission to update what they think is just yahoo messenger the updater then proceeds to hijack many browser preferences including search engine settings
2553184 yahoo going carbon neutral is equivalent to shutting off the electricity in all san francisco homes for a month or pulling nearly 25 000 cars off the road for a year

2553202 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2553203 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2553204 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented
2553205 theres probably no way to explain what it was like
2553206 one of the most moving things of my life was the bus ride from the airport back to gibbs hall and seeing people waving their tennessee banners stopping their cars and flashing their lights i was touched to the point i couldnt fight back the tears i doubt ive gotten any more pleasure out of a victory because it meant so much to so many who been have loyal to tennessee over the years
2553207 the most amazing feat i have seen in all my years of football
2553208 it meant so much to the players and coaches and the great tennessee people who were there physically and on television
2553209 ive heard people say that other than the birth of their first child their marriage or the first christmas they remember it was the most exciting moment of their lives
2553210 the united states olympic committee has learned of an incident that occurred earlier today involving two family members of a coach for the united states olympic mens indoor volleyball team

2553218 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2553219 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2553220 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2553221 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now

2553271 a floral fragrance that remains spare dry flinty and uncompromising from beginning to end
2553272 i know that it is just my personal reaction to some chemical in it but there is something in devin that attacks me with an acid sharp highly unpleasant and annoying green note that is huge
2553273 its the prominent green that is too off putting for me this sharp green is annoyingly common and linear and the rest of the fragrance is not good enough to make up for that annoyance insens is not a very complex fragrance it lacks depth and texture and its mediocrity is aggravated by its linearity
2553274 the consistent green sharpness is more aggressive than it needs to be
2553275 its potency possibly imposes a masculinity on the florals but it also removes much of the potential balance and refinement that it should have
2553276 i used to swim in a pool a long time ago where there was this white flowers and grass garden close to it and at the very end of the drydown it reminded me of myself being in the pool with those flowers looking in

2553317 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2553318 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2553319 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2553320 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2553321 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2553322 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2553323 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2553324 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality

2553375 the implications for dogs is that we have the possibility to reduce the frequency of this mutation in the population and in this way immediately avoid new cases of crd caused by this mutation
2553376 for humans the study may help in the identification of the etiology of some cases of crd and the dog could also be an extremely valuable model for the development of new treatment schemes for crd including gene therapy
2553377 it may not be the same mechanism in humans but they think that it is

2553387 joey cheek had planned to invoke a olympic truce a time honored concept of an olympic truce to call attention to a humanitarian crisis in sudan he did not intend to directly protest a chinese government a fact that ay pulled his visa is so contrary to a olympic ideal it is simply outrageous

2553389 i was born a buddhist but i never really knew what it meant although in japan you do have some really strict monasteries the monks we know from funerals and family gatherings drive mercedes benzs they have wives theyre smoking cigarettes
2553390 saw some lay tibetan people not monks in the act of prostration as you say prayers and walk you throw your body on the ground
2553391 that gave me the sense of giving up your ego and that was when i understood what buddhism is really about
2553392 that image was how do you say it in english my aha moment
2553393 i heard the story about this monk who was in prison under the chinese government
2553394 and i couldnt believe anybody could survive 33 years of torture and imprisonment i came from a country where after the war everything kind of settled my parents generation built up everything people were living peacefully
2553395 i didnt speak english i didnt have friends i was lonely
2553396 as soon as he came to the door i started crying
2553397 i told him i want to thank you for surviving and for being an inspiration for my life
2553398 our fear was that people might get tired of watching one old mans story its not sex drugs rock and roll but we took the risk

2553400 he is very very determined very strong willed but he has this really interesting side where he smiles like a 3 year old boy very innocently when hes asked a question about tibet he has to be very precise and very strict and the next moment hes smiling like a kid

2553430 most of the american team is not staying at the olympic village but at a well guarded university campus
2553431 here theyre staying here and were guarding their compound but we are allowing them to have their own security
2553432 the problem is not that we have become too strict the problem is before there were practically no restrictions or control at all

2553471 en la interdependiente sociedad actual los problemas rurales enseguida se convierten en problemas urbanos y viceversa ninguno de estos dos sectores puede progresar por mucho tiempo si el otro languidece

2553481 corina parca revine la sentimente mai bune in ceea ce priveste dragostea iar a cincea piesa
2553482 are un sound ametitor dar cool si clipul piesei e foarte deosebit
2553483 o stiti cu siguranta dar e o melodie mult prea lenta pentru stilul corinei asta nu inseamna ca nu imi place
2553484 e foarte energica si poti dansa pe ea fara probleme
2553485 they are the focal points but most of them are in danger today i brought the issue before the court but was told there is no provision in any of the rules so i had to manage by myself and find the money from elsewhere to relocate them the court does nothing about it
2553486 even if we could reach them ourselves we would put victims at risk by talking to them directly we need an intermediary who is not only an interpreter but a countryperson who understands the geography of darfur and how the conflict unfolded
2553487 individuals associated with militia groups have turned up at the houses of some of the intermediaries we work with demanding to see them and for them to provide the whereabouts of other individuals they believe are working with the icc
2553488 family members of activists are stopped on the road by men and threatened and some of their partners have received threatening emails and text messages
2553489 already i have received threats and my family is threatened we have brought these issues before the icc and have been told that the courts statute has foreseen nothing about it so there is nothing the icc can do
2553490 they said bad things about the legal representatives of lubanga victims and said they know my house the night i received that information there was shooting around my house
2553491 ruptured to such a degree that it is now impossible to piece together the constituent elements of a fair trial
2553492 if lawyers are being threatened they should be protected witnesses are entitled to protection along with their family the same thing should apply to lawyers
2553493 it is absolutely fundamental that lawyers are provided support if the icc does not provide it one could argue that the trial does not meet international standards of fairness
2553494 it is the responsibility of the states in question to protect the lives of their citizens there is no provision in the rome statute or any of our legal texts to ensure their security in another way
2553495 the sudanese government has vowed to exterminate people who are cooperating with the court
2553496 they are risking their lives and as if that is not enough now they are supposed to go to the victims and explain what is happening the prosecutor needs to acknowledge his responsibility to explain what is happening he cannot escape it
2553497 in order to address possible confusion and misunderstandings we have taken every opportunity to communicate with the population to this effect we sent a mission to kinshasa in early july together with the registry we are planning further outreach activities in ituri next september
2553498 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2553499 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2553500 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2553501 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2553502 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society
2553503 all indications show the 2008 election will probably have the largest youth voter turnout the largest hip hop voter turnout in u s history

2553518 the belief that the government in ottawa cannot be the solution to all our problems and that local and provincial governments are often better suited to the task
2553519 g iven a choice between a so called progressive federal government that intervenes in the social policies of the provinces and one that is more conservative and does not francophone quebecers to this day will pick the latter
2553520 only a conservative vision that takes government back to its proper role and thereby concedes to quebec the space required for its own civil society can hold the country together for the long term
2553521 was to speak to quebecers about the ways they are like the rest of his pan canadian voter coalition not about the esoteric differences it is inherently a unifying discourse
2553522 harpers on the winning side of public opinion in a debate that pits him squarely against an elite quebec consensus
2553523 the reality is that quebecers are still divided on these kind of issues and that it is risky to claim that a position or its opposite represents a qu bec value
2553524 la conviction que le gouvernement ottawa ne peut pas tre la solution tous nos probl mes et que les gouvernements locaux et provinciaux sont souvent mieux adapt s la t che
2553525 sils ont choisir entre un gouvernement f d ral soi disant progressiste qui intervient dans les politiques sociales des provinces et un qui est plus conservateur mais ny intervient pas les qu b cois francophones jusqu ce jour choissisent la deuxi me option
2553526 seule une vision conservatrice qui recentre le gouvernement sur son r le appropri et c de ainsi au qu bec lespace requis pour sa propre soci t civile peut garder ce pays uni long terme
2553527 harper est en train de gagner la bataille de lopinion publique dans un d bat qui le met clairement en opposition au consensus de l lite qu b coise

2553531 el departamento del trabajo est llevando a cabo un estudio para verificar si el salario que reciben las mujeres en todos los sectores y en todos los puestos que ocupan equiparan al de los varones
2553532 la procuradora de la mujer y yo estuvimos reunidos y una de las preocupaciones que hay en el pa s es que en muchas ocasiones las mujeres ocupan puestos similares la misma clasificaci n que los varones pero no reciben la misma paga por el mismo trabajo en ese sentido yo quiero conocer la realidad del trabajo de las mujeres de cu l es su salario tomando en consideraci n que ya ellas sobrepasan el 42 del grupo trabajador
2553533 cuando hacemos la encuesta del grupo trabajador preguntamos si trabaja o no obviamente porque el dato m s significativo es calcular todo empleo regular quiero dejar claro que hay muchas personas que trabajan a tiempo parcial que no son consideradas como empleadas porque un s lo empleo a tiempo parcial no es suficiente para que un trabajador pueda sostenerse
2553534 it is clear that we have moved on from the fruitless debate between prevention and treatment that has plagued us in the past
2553535 human rights remain at the core of everything we do
2553536 these laws are misdirected and bad they are creating a crisis in hiv management and prevention efforts
2553537 to say we are disappointed is an understatement has the aids conference become just another expensive gab fest
2553538 lets be perfectly clear failure to enact a comprehensive sustained and multipronged attack on the pandemic represents a crime against those infected those affected and those susceptible indeed it represents a crime against humanity
2553539 we are the vanguard of an unprecedented global citizens movement for comprehensive universal primary health care for all

2553555 as the victim of nuclear bombs our country has a duty and responsibility for taking the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons

2553714 desde un punto de vista legal las acciones de rusia en osetia del sur son completamente leg timas
2553715 instamos a las autoridades georgianas a que detengan inmediatamente su agresi n contra osetia del sur a que detengan todas sus violaciones de los acuerdos vigentes de alto el fuego y que respeten los derechos legales y los intereses de otras personas

2553874 i spoke with his owner and we thought about giving turf a whirl
2553875 but he had a temperature that knocked him out a little he was all set for the haskell
2553876 there are still plenty of races left in new york in the fall he is a horse with a promising future that just gets better every time
2553877 i have his shoes off to let his feet air out a little
2553878 no matter how hard you work you need a lot of luck
2553879 as of right now both are being pointed toward the grade 1 alabama august 16
2553880 music note is pretty consistent while little belle is not the best work filly
2553881 we certainly want to run one of the two fillies in the alabama we dont want to miss that race which looks to have a small field
2553882 without big brown the travers looks like it might have 12 horses and thats a consideration
2553883 if theres a plane in between now and then i may put him on that
2553884 he seems to have adjusted to the american method and style of training he didnt have to do a lot of training before his last race here he came in got out of quarantine on thursday trained friday and raced saturday and that was it so hes had to go out and train and come to a new place here and hes handled it all really well
2553885 were not exactly sure what happened to the filly but she was able to get up and walk back home
2553886 ever since last year hes had some little nagging soundness problems
2553887 and its always been up until three days before the race something you can sort of live with he wasnt quite 100 percent but it wasnt something that you couldnt run him
2553888 after he had a strong work on monday three days before the race he was definitely worse the next day
2553889 his right front leg had an inflamed area we called in the vet and he said we better scan it the horse had a small tear in the top of suspensory and they recommended four to six months off
2553890 ive been training horses on the oklahoma track forever because thats my track of preference and ive never seen a horse work as good as he did but hes a hell of a horse
2553891 he won the maryland sprint championship and then he came back and injured his foot in his last start and he didnt really fire he quarter cracked his foot very badly and we have not had him right until today and if he cools out of this okay today he will be in a race next week either a stakes or an allowance

2553915 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2553916 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2553917 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2553918 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2553919 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2553920 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on al qaida s operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2553921 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed
2553922 we were fairly close especially the second set it was just a matter of keeping my nerve not thinking about what the score was just playing the point

2553935 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2553936 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2553937 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2553938 but theres no sign saying steep hill here either and my volga unlike like a plane doesnt have an altitude meter so where the hill ends and whether this really is a hill is a matter of subjective judgment you think one way i think another and this cannot be the basis for administrative sanctions you can tell that all to the magistrate was the reply come to my car and file a report i had to obey when i filled out the report form i registered my categorical disagreement with the inspector noting the lack of marking and signs prohibiting overtaking my license was taken away and i was given a temporary permit to drive after signing the summons to the magistrate in the report the inspector let me go explaining that with this permit i could drive as much as i wanted until the court verdict revoking my license came into effect i began analysing the situation as i got together the necessary documents besides the road code i downloaded the chapter 12 of the administrative code the section on cars i also bought a useful book by d a usoltsev from usoltsev i learned among other things that the inspector who stopped me had broken the road code himself as well as the departmental regulations of the stsi his car wasnt stationary when the incident happened when i started to overtake i saw it coming out on to the highway in front of me where it had been waiting in ambush on the left making a left turn and not indicating then obviously because he saw me in the rear view mirror he turned around without indicating drove back and parked the inspector got out and stopped me opposite his car he was supposed to obey the regulations for the road patrol service of the state inspectorate of traffic safety of the interior ministry of the russian federation article 13 6 of which states it is prohibited to stop a vehicle on sections of roads with restricted visibility before and after a turn immediately before and after the top of a hill and in other dangerous places with the exception of cases when there is a need to stop to avoid undesirable consequences as my car was stopped directly on the side of the highway practically opposite the stsi car one of the following applies 1 either the inspector believing that id overtaken near the end of a hill or on another section of the road with restricted visibility violated this article of the regulations himself 2 or the inspector didnt think that this section of the road was the end of a hill in this case hes contradicting himself and is accordingly violating article 13 7 of the regulations which state it is prohibited to stop a vehicle without urgent need and hes also violating the decree of the russian interior ministry on reform of the activity of the state automobile inspectorate of the russian mvd which states stopping vehicles in other cases not covered by article 13 7 are assessed as a violation of official discipline the next interesting observation i made concerns the rules themselves in the article which i was accused of violating as we recall the concept of restricted visibility appears the road code is a legislative document and like any law it contains a preamble with a definition of the terms used in this case it is article 1 2 which does not however mention any restricted visibility there is insufficient visibility which is not defined very clearly road visibility of less than 300 m in conditions of fog rain snow and so on and also at dusk but is at least defined but what restricted visibility is we can only guess at because common sense cannot add anything here as we know unrestricted visibility does not exist apparently a definition of this concept was included in the previous version of the rules then it disappeared although the actual concept still appears in the complete version of the articles of the road code you come to expect that quality of work from the russian state dumas legal drafts considering all this and also remembering that russian judges prefer to read rather than listen i began to write an explanation and then showed it to oleg iordansky one of the most qualified lawyers in petersburg he proposed various changes and improvements and also recommended that i appeal for the case to be moved to the court where i live the court where the inspector summoned you is probably in the pay of the local stsi its also out of town and youll have to appeal the decision at the nearest regional centre do you really need that all that driving first magistrate court 19 th court district sertolovo village when i arrived in the appointed place at the appointed time i looked at a list of cases to be examined on that day there were 23 of them 22 involved violations of my article of the code 12 15 4 the next day 45 of these cases were going to be processed of a total of 45 it seemed that the lawyers suggestion that this court specialised in such cases was spot on what did this place of justice look like like all such places in russia steep icy stairs without a rail led to a door without a sign inside was a crowded room with ten seats 23 defendants were summoned and at the same time and repeat defendants also turned up they were allowed to jump the line we obviously had to sit there for a long time and there were no toilets for the public incidentally there were also no toilets in the two other legal institutions that i had to go to this i think is in accordance with the tradition of russias legal system it is as it were a measure of its humanism sitting in this room together with my fellow defendants under the unhappy number of 12 15 4 i heard a lot of interesting things for example most of them were convinced that the stsi intentionally provokes cars to overtake in the wrong place by putting a tractor or some other slow vehicle on the highway while they watch the road and rub their hands in anticipation of the harvest my meeting with the sertolovo magistrate was quite predictable i handed over the written appeal to transfer the case to my place of residence and he approved it what else could he do between the first and second courts preparation i was not the only unlucky person that day as it turned out theres a concerted campaign going on in the country to apply article 12 15 4 so concerted that the inspector who stopped me gave me no hint that i might be able to resolve the case directly with him on the spot ill be quite frank out of curiosity i tried this on him and he rejected my hint outright clearly the traffic cops have got some quota to fill although i wouldnt have given him a bribe in any case i almost never do especially not in a situation where im not to blame otherwise it would be like accepting that anyone can stop me at any time and take money off me im not prepared to accept that and i never will as always in terrifying situations like this people come up with ways to protect themselves like any normal person i asked advice through friends of friends and their friends and i got the same suggestions from various sources they proposed that i could resolve the matter for about 25 000 rubles if this service is provided by employees of the stsi everything should work as follows at the court hearing the inspector turns up in person beats himself on the chest and says that he got carried away it wasnt really as bad as all that it is clear why this is so expensive hes not only got to interrupt his serious work by the roadside which earns him good money hes also got to admit publicly that hes an idiot legal firms proposed an alternative i decided to got to one of them called road patrol which i found in an article in the newspaper moy rayon and i was quite right to do so the company really did have people who specialised in problems like mine despite the advertised fee of 500 rubles per consultation they did not take my money and they gave me various very useful suggestions did you hold your documents in your hands was the first thing they asked no thats a shame you shouldve taken it and seen what was there besides the police report and what else could have been there lots of things a diagram for instance did you see the diagram the inspector drew afterwards no well there you go if id known that earlier id have looked at it in court i reflected there would have been some point in going to sertovalo the next recommendation was to take a photograph of the actual place of the unforgettable meeting the road the state ie absence of markings etc i should take photographs and attach an explanation the final and as it turned out the most important recommendation was to petition the court to send an enquiry to the competent service about the signs and markings in that area of the highway we can take on your case they told me as i left it will cost you 2 000 rubles for our lawyer to come to court if you win the case and this happens three times out of four youll pay a total of 15 000 rubles do you really win cases that often yes we do reports are often wrongly filed and thats already grounds for rejecting them

2553941 i know that the folks here in hawaii are especially hard hit because everything has to come into hawaii and gas prices have gone up the roof fuel prices have gone through the roof and its time that you got some real relief and that means actually starting to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2553942 weve been divided for so long weve been arguing for so long a lot of times about things that arent even worth arguing about and ignoring the things that we should be doing to make the next generation have a better life
2553943 but they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands that the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars to finish the job in afghanistan and start bringing this war in iraq to a close start bringing our troops out and when they come home to treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve no more homeless vets no more begging for disability payments

2553964 their messiah could be born from any of their woman at any given time
2553965 never thought of the tree of life descending from paradise
2553966 to convince or force satan and the pharaoh of egypt to let the hebrews go to their land
2553967 for the egyptians to begin to believe that the god of the hebrews was more powerful than satan
2553968 even satan and some other people wanted to see for themselves
2553969 but our god did not allow them to come close to him
2553970 to touch the hearts and burn clean inside the people from darkness
2553971 just as he would be speaking to him person to person in the holy of holies
2553972 this was the most important place on earth for the messiah to speak to israel
2553973 anyone that would enter into this holy place of the most holy then he would drop dead
2553974 remove your sandals for the ground you are standing is holy
2553975 i am the god of your ancestors speaking to you
2553976 they may go to the land promised to their ancestors generations ago
2553977 but only through the wonderful working powers of the tree of life shining and burning in their hearts
2553978 life and liberty for all of them to enjoy at last
2553979 of the tree of life our king messiah of all times our lord jesus christ the son of god
2553980 may take place in the heart of moses and in the hearts of his brothers as well
2553981 i did not manifest myself to them with mine name
2553982 because he neither knows me as the god of the hebrews and much less he knows the tree of life the king messiah
2553983 the pharaoh has added sin to his sins and to the sins of egypt as well
2553984 they had not honored his name as moses honored it when he first heard it from his lips within the midst of the fire on the mountaintop of sinai
2553985 our heavenly father was angry with the rebellion of the egyptians against the word of his son in the burning bush
2553986 he needed it to put his people in the land of israel almost immediately
2553987 but only in the land of canaan the present israel
2553988 where our god created them in his hands in his image and in according to his likeness
2553989 through the spirit of the sacrificed blood of the lamb of god the son of david since the foundation of the heavens and the earth
2553990 preferred to shed the sacrificed blood of the son of david his only begotten son
2553991 only by the powers of the spirit of the sacrificed blood and life of his dear son
2553992 just as he was important and his atoning blood in the doorpost of their homes so they may escape the angel of death for ever and ever
2553993 thus to enter the promised land of the king messiah the son of david
2553994 he just needed them to obey him and his king messiah
2553995 to escape the certain destruction and death from the angel of death and satan
2553996 you will see what he is about to do for you against your enemies
2553997 on that crucial hour of their lives between going back to egypt or dying beneath the violent waters of the red sea
2553998 moses realized also that the spirit of the supernatural blessing of the sacrificed blood is forever
2553999 they may continue freely on their way to cross the sea
2554000 just enough time for the hebrews to begin to cross the sea and enter into the desert
2554001 the egyptians and their horses may drown beneath the waters and you will never see them again
2554002 our heavenly father glorified his holy name over them according to the words he told moses
2554003 the lord god has crowned himself with glory and triumph by throwing the egyptians and its horses into the waters of the red sea
2554004 it would feel even thirstier than before and probably die on the spot too
2554005 become another pile of sand in this desert in no time
2554006 full of the power of blessing and salvation from heaven above to grant them what they needed
2554007 so sweet as milk and honey from heaven to drink
2554008 was the king messiah our lord jesus christ the son of david
2554009 by eating the meat of the sacrifice lamb back in egypt
2554010 god showed moses the tree that he should throw into the bitter waters so they may become sweet as milk and honey to drink
2554011 with the body life spirit and sweetness of the king messiah the son of david
2554012 i will not bring upon you any of the infirmities that i brought upon the egyptians
2554013 i am the lord your god that gives you health and takes care of you
2554014 but he was with them in his spirit to fulfill the will of god
2554015 sweetened miraculously with the tree of life from his holy kingdom
2554016 they had truly drink out from their king messiah as saying that they were now part of the tree of life eternally
2554017 forgetting like this all what the lord god had done for them
2554018 i will be there waiting for you and your people with your herds
2554019 but this time the rock will give water nonetheless in abundance to drink
2554020 i will be there for you as i was with you in egypt and in all of its places
2554021 but it was also to enter into the virgin daughter of king david from the tribe of judah so the messiah would be born sinless
2554022 sweetened bitter water by the tree and water from the rock and the holy spirit of the law of the life of the messiah
2554023 they would lift up the king messiah nailed to the crossed trees of adam and eve on top of the eternal rock outside jerusalem
2554024 but also into the brand new heavenly jerusalem where peace and the eternal glory of the messiah abound
2554025 through the desert for forty years to finally introduce them into israel for the messiah to be received by them extraordinarily
2554026 the flesh bones blood and the life of the living king messiah the son of david
2554027 as the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world
2554028 when a man believes in me he does not believe in me only but in the one who sent me when he looks at me in truth he sees the one who sent me the heavenly father for the father and i are one i have come out from the father to meet you today that is why i know him and he knows me very well in fact i have come into the world as a light so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness but be transferred to the light more shining than the sun and the stars of the heavens
2554029 our heavenly father would have sent it to the world already
2554030 has come out from the light of the heavenly father and from his dear son our lord jesus christ
2554031 the spirit of the son of david is so vital in our lives nowadays
2554032 this is the holy sacrificed blood that satan intended to stop from entering into adam and israel
2554033 if they do believe in jesus christ as the son of god then they would automatically believe in our heavenly father
2554034 it may enter into the life of humanity to stay forever and ever
2554035 this is the only true light that outshines the souls of men from darkness to the outmost heavenly holiness
2554036 he needs to establish his holy temple and his tree of life in israel as well
2554037 but to know eternally that the lord jesus christ is the son of david
2554038 as their only king messiah possible for the salvation of their eternal living souls
2554039 but only in the name of his dearly beloved son the son of david our lord jesus christ
2554040 you will never be the same person again on earth
2554041 literately filled with the light of the tree of life
2554042 that there will be no darkness within you forevermore but only light
2554043 just as his dear son jesus christ is the light of the angels and the light of humankind as well
2554044 and satan will never be able to defeat you again
2554045 believes the one who sent him to israel to fulfill his promise of blessings and eternal salvation from sin to them and the entire world
2554046 the man that sees me does not only see me but also the heavenly father for he is the one that sent the prophets to israel and finally his son on these days to complete his will according to his eternal hearts desire
2554047 it was fulfilled for the glory and honor of his wonderful working miracle name when they saw jesus christ before them in israel
2554048 just as moses saw him for the first time in the midst of the burning bush on mount sinai
2554049 moses continued to see the son of david in the most holy place of the holies
2554050 he will not put up with you and your sins
2554051 so you may be victorious over them and possess their lands
2554052 where all the nations of humankind will dwell in the spirit of eternal love peace joy happiness health and everlasting prosperity
2554053 he bears my name from eternity to eternity within his sanctified life
2554054 to deliver you from the power of your captors thus to go on your way through the desert to the promised land
2554055 but now he lives in the power of the light of the tree of light
2554056 sanctified daily by the wonderful working miracle power of the spirit of the sacrificed blood of the king messiah the son of david our lord jesus christ
2554057 if you only can make the spirit of the son of david who is not only the king messiah for israel and humankind but also bears within his holy life the precious and glorious name from our father
2554058 he may be with each one of you today and well into beyond eternity
2554059 has led the hebrews out of egypt and through the hostile and barren desert of the nations to live in the promised land of canaan today
2554060 not only fulfill the spirit of the ten commandments but also clean every heart and soul of man woman and child from the power of sin
2554061 was to be born in the promised land to be forever and ever the king of the hebrews
2554062 the son of god the son of david for the house of israel
2554063 but he has existed always within our heavenly father and his holy spirit as well since beyond the first days of eternity
2554064 spoke to moses and the high priests of israel face to face almost every day of their lives from within the most holiest place from the holies
2554065 is with you today as he was with moses and the hebrews in the ancient days
2554066 if you are willing to believe in the heavenly father and everything he has done for your well being on earth and in the new world to come
2554067 where all is love glory and peace for ever and ever for you and your loved ones also
2554068 he will bless your food water and give you good health all the days of your life until the end of time
2554069 he is your resurrection before the heavenly father in the last day
2554070 to eat and drink from the tree of life and of good health eternally
2554071 he will never permit that any sickness diseases or viruses would invade your home or life
2554072 even though you are not faithful with him at times
2554073 for the glory of his holy name that dwells within his holy heart blood and life for ever and ever
2554074 he will make sure that your sons and daughters are born without any curses sickness or deceases
2554075 he will be with each one of them as he was with moses for example

2554147 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2554148 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2554149 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2554150 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country

2554164 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2554165 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2554166 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2554167 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2554168 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2554169 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2554170 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2554171 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2554172 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2554173 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2554174 how you handle it depends on the type of pet you have but some things apply to all pets and the type of travel you plan airplane or car
2554175 animals that travel via airplane must endure rough rugged travel in the luggage compartment that is cold and unmanned
2554176 in the summertime the luggage compartment can be hot with poor air ventilation while the plane awaits take off from the airport some people do not realize that their animals are handled by luggage handlers not flight attendants many times dogs cats and other animals that are transported in a carrier can experience rough treatment by luggage handlers because their carriers are mistaken for luggage and are unknowingly tossed around
2554177 sometimes you can let a dog or cat rest its head on your lap or lay on its blanket with recognizable scents to provide a sense of familiarity and comfort
2554178 it is also important to line the interior of the carrier with a blanket for additional comfort and secure the travel carrier to avoid excessive jarring and motion
2554179 i have taken road trips with a parrot on my shoulder a six foot boa constrictor on my lap and a dog resting on a blanket on the back seat its truly about making the animal comfortable and feel relaxed during the travel experience
2554180 it all depends on the temperament of the animal and if it is accustomed to riding in a vehicle

2554450 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2554451 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2554452 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2554453 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2554454 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on al qaida s operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2554455 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed
2554456 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2554457 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2554458 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2554459 we were fairly close especially the second set it was just a matter of keeping my nerve not thinking about what the score was just playing the point
2554460 i tried everything and it was very close this was a very important game for me of course i am disappointed but that is how it goes
2554461 she had nothing to lose she wanted to come up with me hard im really proud that i fought back and got that victory in the end

2554471 for the journalist in search of a story to beat his or her rivals there is nothing more welcome than the brown envelope with the classified documents the tip off about a big inquirys findings or the tale of cabinet room bust up

2554473 when my father saw us on tv and realised how serious we were he told me youre not my son anymore
2554474 but he soon came to terms with it even comparing me to the legendary abey natan
2554475 so we want to go as soon as possible its the most patriotic thing we can do for our country
2554476 look at baraks campaign slogan that hes the best equipped to lead the country to war
2554477 we dont need leaders like that we need them to say theyre the best equipped to lead the country to peace
2554478 it should have been a good thing we lost the war last summer because it forces us to come to the negotiating table rather than rely on military might
2554479 im certain people will be nice to us on a one to one level
2554480 just as i know people who say they hate palestinians but when they actually hang out with palestinians in tel aviv on an individual basis they get on famously with them

2554482 whereas well be in five dinar a day hostels with no barriers to communication
2554483 we dont want to be in a sterilised atmosphere with walls security guards and so on because that only encourages the participants to be afraid
2554484 but thats because they have been conditioned to see syrians as devils they demonise them even more than they do the palestinians because at least theyve had contact with palestinians so they are forced to see them as human at least

2554488 design no longer informs or educates it blindly promotes the accumulation of wealth and power it aestheticizers corporate greed and commercially motivated waste design is something to be used up its primary significance is that it will lose significance
2554489 the need for art and imagination to break free from the market has never been greater designers must assess the consequences of their work the practice of design must be motivated by ongoing social concern designers must move beyond their drawing tables step outside their macs reconnect their concerns to contours of popular experience and aspiration and establish a means for dialog
2554490 typography and design can be removed from the confidence games of consumer engineers and become part of an organic process affirming free thought free expression new social relations such education can then be carried on into the arenas and practices of everyday life

2554508 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2554509 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2554510 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons

2554520 germany supports zionist desires to attack iran and save the world from iranian nukes and oh by the way germany is so very sorry for the holohoax holocaust the german people were livid at her groveling before the knesset in tel aviv germany has been on its knees before zionism since it lost the war listen clearly no one is going to sit still for a us naval blockade of iran no one both russia and china will respond and it will be with force russia has just made it abundantly clear to georgia what the price is for killing russians under lunatic bush zionist plans russia can easily crush the entire country of georgia and will do just that if it does not cease and desist they are showing the scenes on bbc out of london rtr planeta out of moscow proseiben 7 out of germany and other television stations russia is striking back in force and they are increasing their ability by the hour to put more troops tanks and jets into position to crush georgia if that little bush ally wants to play hardball with the russian bear where this bush shits and giggles game has now reached the warning sign is that there are many russian contractors and russian technicians at the iranian nuclear sites that bush and israel wish to bomb there is no way to avoid killing or injuring russians at those sites in zionist obsession to take over iran and destroy it as they have done to iraq if anyone in america thinks russia will not cannot defend its interests let the us attack iran and see how fast russia and china ram reality up americas butt and down its throat liars lies and more damned lies that is bushco and its zionist criminal co conspirators in london and tel aviv uk prime minister gordon brown john mccain and barky obama have all been in israel within the past month speaking to the zionist knesset parliament and they have each vowed the official lie regarding iran so did german chancellor schmerkel and enraged the german citizens by her pathetic groveling as we have shown without a shadow of a doubt iran never made the comment that israel should be wiped off the map with any form of force that is a western zionist lie used to start the next war ahmadinejads comment was that regime change is needed in tel aviv http www rense com general82 tran htm

2554528 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2554529 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2554530 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2554531 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2554532 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2554533 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2554534 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2554535 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2554536 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2554537 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2554538 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2554539 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2554540 to determine if the source of those funds is gone long term or if there might be other things that we can do
2554541 the real benefit of this program is the access that it allows students to have to higher education
2554542 students sometimes have barriers of time or barriers of distance to higher education this program has been able to break down those barriers
2554543 were always looking for ways and open to ways we can serve adult learners
2554544 its core to who we are its core to our educational mission we were certainly disappointed that the program is ending
2554545 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2554546 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

2554557 all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not really
2554558 people who have to deal with black employees find this not true
2554559 there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level
2554560 there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so
2554561 it is sad to see a scientist of such achievement making such baseless unscientific and extremely offensive comments
2554562 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
2554563 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
2554564 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit v 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death v 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh v 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live v 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god v 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father v 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god v 17 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together v 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us v 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now v 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body v 24 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for v 25 but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it v 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered v 27 and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god v 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose v 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword v 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter v 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us v 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come v 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
2554565 for we must appear before the judgement seat of christ that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body weather good or bad
2554566 you see at just the right time when we were still powerless christ died for the ungodly
2554567 but now in christ jesus you who once were far away have been brought near though the blood of christ
2554568 there was a dynamic missing so the pastor did a pretty brave thing
2554569 he decided to get rid of the sound system and band for a season and we gathered together with just our voices his point was that wed lost our way in worship and the way to get back to the heart would be to strip everything away
2554570 when you come through the doors on a sunday what are you bringing as your offering to god
2554571 before long we reintroduced the musicians and sound system as wed gained a new perspective that worship is all about jesus and the song the heart of worship simply describes what occurred
2554572 when we say quiet on the set it means to be quiet
2554573 you and you we need you up in the announcer box
2554574 is it a bad time to mention that i dont like heights

2554708 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2554709 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2554710 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2554711 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country

2554801 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2554802 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2554803 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2554804 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2554805 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2554806 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2554807 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2554808 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2554809 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2554810 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move

2554817 by the great acorn hes the most beautiful person in all the universe
2554818 nice fur amazing shade of brown never seen anything like it
2554819 so gregarious and demulcent i bet you must be the most good looking human of all perhaps i shant use you for an appetizer
2554820 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
2554821 make a deal with us or we might not be able to control israel
2554822 if he cares for me i will shower him with all my cares
2554823 he was uplifting he was inspiring he was a fantastic orator
2554824 is a pivotal aspect of the palestinian authoritys incitement to hatred against israel and jews
2554825 the possibility remains that more arab white knights will be sought to rescue ailing financial institutions
2554826 it is important to be absolutely clear that the abu dhabi government has never and will never use its investment organizations or individual investments as a foreign policy tool
2554827 me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse discrimination episodes of hate and physical violence including murder
2554828 the court has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of these claims
2554829 for the calm in the south to prevail three elements must be fulfulled
2554830 total absence of all hostile fire into israel an end to arms smuggling and arms buildup in gaza and movement on the issue of freeing gilad shalit without those three elements the calm will not succeed
2554831 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
2554832 jerusalem is a final status issue which means it has to be negotiated between the two parties
2554833 as a practical matter it would be very difficult to execute and i think that it is smart for us to to work through a system in which everybody has access to the extraordinary religious sites in old jerusalem but that israel has a legitimate claim on that city
2554834 the transformation mostly in tone but occasionally in substance might qualify as what obama likes to call the same old washington okey doke
2554835 to awaken hearts towards repentance through recalling our forefathers misdeeds misdeeds which led to calamities
2554836 and on the return of the heroes of freedom the heroes and the martyrs headed by the great samir kuntar and the martyr fighter dalal mughrabi who led the most glorified sacrifice action in the history of the palestinian israeli struggle the fatah party vows to the palestinian people that fatah will continue to struggle in the way of the pure martyrs until the state is liberated and the palestinian state is established with jerusalem as the capital the fatah movement turns on this day that abounds with sincere blessings to hizbullah
2554837 almost from my first day in the prime ministers office
2554838 i feel that i cant fulfill my duties and my ability to fulfill my duties has been blackened
2554839 anyone who heaps insult upon the israelite people as a whole it is as if he is insulting god himself
2554840 got our energy up got our defense rolling and did the things we needed to do to give ourselves some space
2554841 once we did turn it up defensively started pressing and getting after it
2554842 immediately you could see how tired the other team got and they couldnt keep up
2554843 and when she gets it going like that you just gotta keep getting her the ball and let her do what she does if she misses shes getting her own rebound shes pretty impressive
2554844 our depth is going to be key for us this entire trip and you saw it tonight
2554845 everybody had a part in it and it was fun to see that
2554846 but we play china next and im sure its gonna be crazy in that arena and not only that theyre very good so we cant sleep on them we have to be focused but all we need to work on is getting more and more comfortable
2554847 we did not know until after the game so that was pretty cool
2554848 we started off probably a c but we ended up probably a b
2554849 we support each other all the way through we have one goal and thats to win the gold medal so we are going to be behind each other the whole way
2554850 this is their home country and they want to leave out of the olympics with a medal we dont want that to happen it will be a great challenge for us
2554851 they take their issues out on the most defenceless beings available to them

2554890 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2554923 demand more than a polite relationship with jesus and his church
2554924 he is our lord and god what he deserves is our love a love that is expressed in our worship in our service to others and in our obedience to the church
2554925 the kind of radical love expressed in obedience an obedience that can make our hearts ache and bruise our vanity is the seed of renewal in every age of the church
2554926 i entered religious life because i wanted to be one of those seeds because i knew my own happiness depended on it i am sure you want to be those seeds of renewal too
2554927 getting women religious to follow the lead of progressive theologians in renewing themselves into virtual oblivion
2554928 many of the active remnant are among the most aggressively disaffected groups in the church and some publicly declare that the vocation of their community is to go out of business
2554929 the church belongs to christ the church is his spouse and we find his peace through love and obedience to his church which is finally not an institution or corporation or bureaucracy but our mother and teacher
2554930 a difficult crisis due to the aging of members a more or less accentuated fall in vocations and sometimes a spiritual and charismatic weariness
2554931 if your nation overturns legalized abortion i will richly bless it by my favor but if this sin continues with national approval

2554938 they have been abandoned or their fathers are drug addicts or their mothers simply do not want them
2554939 any organisation the minister has specified in writing to vice chancellors as unsuitable to the interests and well being of the students or university
2554940 the act if at all relevant needs to be completely overhauled
2554941 if other 21 year olds can join political parties why is it that we cant just because we are in university
2554942 while i dont think student activism is highly correlated with the quality of a university
2554943 im convinced that having academic and student freedom to organise and freely express their thoughts is a necessary condition towards establishing a world class university
2554944 different universities in the united states and britain have taken different routes towards making themselves world class but all of them have one thing in common academic freedom for students and lecturers to express their thoughts and views and to organise if and when necessary
2554945 we certainly hope the deletion of the presumptive section 15c will apply to university regulations as well
2554946 when we went to talk to kim actons wife she said kim was going to cut the grass today and the next thing there were three people outside with lawn mowers
2554947 he wanted a place for the kids to play and recreate and occupy their time in a positive sense

2554953 it didnt have any strange noises at all it was just a low flying aircraft
2554954 i didnt see anything because theres a hill behind me but there was an enormous thud like something hit into the mud
2554955 i could see an airplane that had crashed with debris in the field that was spread northeast for a couple hundred feet

2554962 from a south african point of view we certainly dont want to lose any test matches we would be really gutted to lose the last test match here
2554963 as long as we remember the things that have got us to this point we will be fine going forward and we will keep improving
2554964 the guys are going to be fighting to win this one because we still have the opportunity to do so

2554978 i think its very important as this government continues to move in the direction of increased revenues as a result of the growing economy that we use the additional revenues into the government to pay our past due obligations and reduce our deficit
2554979 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2554980 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2554981 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran

2554990 we want to make sure as we move through this budget process we try to keep those appropriations at least intact

2555004 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2555005 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout

2555015 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2555016 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2555017 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2555018 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2555019 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them

2555023 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2555024 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2555025 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2555026 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2555027 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2555028 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2555029 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2555030 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2555031 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2555032 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2555033 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2555034 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2555035 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2555036 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2555037 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2555038 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2555039 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2555040 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2555041 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2555042 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2555043 there is no winning or losing in war there is only ruin
2555044 there is no future for humans without the elimination of nuclear weapons
2555045 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2555046 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe

2555055 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2555056 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2555057 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2555058 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2555059 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2555063 any suggestions for good stories about ms interoperability so far
2555064 these pronouncements appear to be an important change in how we share information about our products and technologies and a significant expansion in apparent transparency
2555065 while weve promised considerable progress over the past several years todays announcement takes our virtual commitment to a new level
2555066 for the past thirty years we have carefully shared misinformation with thousands of now bankrupt partners around the world by promoting greater interoperability opportunity and choice we hope to share even more of their information to our benefit pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
2555067 where it community is defined as microsoft partners this provides remarkable opportunity for it consultants and increased choice of us in the marketplace
2555068 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2555069 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2555139 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2555140 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2555141 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2555142 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch everyday and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different that any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2555143 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2555144 some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently cased by desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences

2555146 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2555147 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2555148 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2555149 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame

2555158 it is a genetic trait or tendency which begins as general inhumanity and graduates into total idiocy evil is a programmed self destructive dysfunction and i believe it came into this world with the arrival of the aliens and the genetic manipulation of earths indigenous humanoid species you see once these reptilians came above ground they began to physically alter and psychologically mold the indigenous surface dwellers into useful slaves to help facilitate the rebuilding of their hardware there is ample evidence to show that this was done through genetic manipulation and very likely at atlantis
2555159 you have to be one of the merlins st germains or dr john dees of magical lore to understand it this is what were up against beings that have the knowledge of the very real power of magic this knowledge has not only been suppressed from humankind but it is used against us today
2555160 i dont know if the fathers need or want to leave earth by 2012
2555161 i just think that they want to leave as fast as they can and return to their former lives and its too late for a physical fight what we need to do is too become more aware of the subtler influences of symbolism the western world is symbol belligerent todays schools intentionally dont teach this as part of the suppression of our higher selves what good does it do to pick up a book on carl jung or joseph campbell at age thirty with no background or upbringing on the subject consequently few comprehend their work
2555162 the solution is organic and has to do with the earths core
2555163 we have to wake up the earth all of the teachings are useless unless we are all facing the center focusing all of our attention and intention towards the middle the crystal core the native americans subscribe to the idea that if we all stand together on the surface of the earth and lines are extended from space through each persons head through their feet to the earths core the lines only converge if you look to the middle the core the lines diverge heading outward so we must come together and look inward to restore balance if you love the earth you are immediately moved to action

2555175 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking

2555210 the thing thats great is obviously newberry has experience so i dont think it will be that big of an adjustment but its still something new weve got to get used to the preseason games are going to be helpful with that
2555211 the goal is to keep our best 53 players guys that contribute
2555212 special teams becomes such a factor weve got a lot of guys that have been good on special teams a lot of linebackers that have been good special teams players

2555218 under the independence constitution of kenya obama became a kenyan citizen on december 12 1963 he has never renounced his kenyan citizenship on his senate web site obama tap dances around his own dual nationality when discussing his father obama obviously knows because his father told him that he also held holds kenyan nationality the american people when deciding who to support for president have a right to know if their president is also a citizen of kenya and owes dual loyalty to kenya because he has never renounced his kenyan citizenship
2555219 it now appears that this same team traveled to mombasa and dug up a certificate registering the birth of barack obama jr to his father a kenyan citizen and mother an american citizen
2555220 obama later confessed that he never searched for the government documents on the marriage although madelyn obamas maternal grandmother insisted they were legally married

2555226 think of the legacy he left you a curiosity about life a hunger for knowledge a passion for the outdoors an example of a life whose riches owe little to money those are all great gifts that he passed to you and you can pass them to gunnar
2555227 when we were chased from our homes we were only allowed to take our travel fare out of the north all our jewelry and money were taken away by the ltte we were reduced to begging and that is how we lived for eighteen years in this camp
2555228 some left for jaffna during the peace talks between 2002 and 2005 looking for jobs but we did not because we thought that we too would have to return like many of those who went home but came back to this camp saying they could not have access to their land which were now occupied by tamil families others returned because their homes in jaffna were turned to rubble in the thirty year old war
2555229 my home is in osmania town a predominantly muslim area in jaffna soon after the ceasefire between the sri lankan government and the ltte in 2002 february and the subsequent agreement signed between the sri lanka muslim congress slmc leader rauff hakeem and the ltte leader vellupillai prabhakaran my father mother brother and i left for jaffna we wished to see if we could earn a living by buying and selling old household goods
2555230 we did not face any major problem with the ltte and did well in the first two years after the ceasefire there were many expatriate tamils returning from abroad for short visits who dispensed with foreign goods when they left
2555231 my family had land and a partially bombed house in jaffna which we repaired as best as we could after we went there during the ceasefire but we had no permanent guarantee that our home would continue to be accessible for us if the conflict restarted
2555232 people in this camp saved money by skipping their already frugal meals
2555233 i have no more money i saved and borrowed and begged for work to pay for this land and to build a single room brick home with a proper zinc roof for my children
2555234 we received ten perches of land for rs 2 500 but there is no water here to get even a little water we have to dig over sixty feet
2555235 there are no taps at all the situation is so bad that people from other areas in puttalam where the water facility exists do a business here selling water a can of 30 litres of water goes for ten rupees and a four member family would need about three cans per day
2555236 there are various regulations and sometimes some families are suddenly cut off the list since the amount is very small many do not make much effort to meet government officials to rectify the omissions we have not been getting these food stamps for years now
2555237 we do not have a muslim minister from either kilinochchi or jaffna to work for our welfare this is why we have to pay rs 20 000 for piped water to be supplied while the muslims displaced from mannar who have a minister from mannar have to pay a mere rs 2 500 to get the tap service to their homes
2555238 we want government officials to either settle us in our own lands in government controlled territory in the north or give us some basic facilities here in puttalam so we can live like human beings
2555239 in karambe you will find luxury houses having been built for those who already own houses in other parts of sri lanka it is these peoples names who were sent up when a project for 600 houses was initiated with the help of the uae government
2555240 there are still many from mannar who are also in a difficult situation
2555241 the muslims from the north whether it be from mannar or jaffna or kilinochchi or vavuniya have all got land now in puttalam but there are so many puttalam muslims who do not have their own homes or land
2555242 the peoples revival front was inaugurated in march this year to give political representation for the idps from jaffna and other northern areas where they have no political representation
2555243 jaffna is the land of our birth what our party wants is to fight for our right to live and die in jaffna and in the other four areas of the north from where we were chased out
2555244 children who were born after 1990 do not know what jaffna is
2555245 i want to build up to 14 000 houses for the displaced community but we are still trying to secure the money from foreign donors
2555246 we lack road water and housing facilities our children are unable to attend school regularly as there is no proper transport service we dont have any facility and leading the same life even now as same as 18 years ago
2555247 even if a single tamil asks for tamil eelam his right to his legitimate land should be recognised
2555248 therefore over the past twenty years the provincial councils neither became a meaningful channel in

2555252 he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2555253 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2555254 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2555255 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2555256 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2555257 from very early on i thought he was destined for success

2555263 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2555264 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2555265 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2555266 were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2555267 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder

2555277 sleep deprivation is one way the enemy tries to get you to say what they want to hear
2555278 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2555279 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2555280 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2555281 i know weve been out of contact well get in more contact its been a busy couple weeks
2555282 p dyin my s siihen ett vaikka kuuluisat ajattelijat ajattelevat melkein samanlaisesti kuin min niin erotuksena on se ett he vain ovat v h n kuuluisampia
2555283 oh its that woman again why doesnt she get a life move on and get some new clothes
2555284 soy una sobreviviente si puedo seguir viviendo despu s de todo lo que me pas tambi n pueden hacerlo otras mujeres
2555285 recib atenci n psicol gica alimentos cuidados m dicos y educaci n y as pude sobrevivir al trauma
2555286 despu s de la guerra mujeres ni os ni as y poblaciones desplazadas
2555287 en diciembre de 2007 estall la violencia en kenia tras las disputadas elecciones debimos abandonar nuestros hogares y alojarnos en un campamento
2555288 estuve tres semanas sin tomarlos ten a miedo de ir a buscarlos
2555289 fue terrible pens que morir a pero no por el sida sino por el conflicto
2555290 mis cinco hijos y yo ten amos una sola s bana y la falta de alimentos era grave
2555291 pero eso fue cuando ya hab an muerto 10 personas
2555292 no hemos encontrado un v nculo claro entre conflictos y vih
2555293 los datos de esos pa ses no indican un aumento de la prevalencia del con vih en periodos conflictivos independiente de la prevalencia registrada al inicio del conflicto
2555294 la baja cantidad de transmisiones de vih durante las relaciones sexuales la menor cantidad de agresores portadores respecto de lo que se pensaba y la reducci n de la movilidad social durante el conflicto
2555295 limitar fondos personal e intervenciones en beneficio de otros grupos y programas para diferentes contextos que puedan tener mayores consecuencias en materia de salud p blica
2555296 la comunidad de lucha contra el sida es blanco de ataques por hacer un mal uso de los datos en pro de su objetivo de conseguir fondos
2555297 tiene baja prevalencia del vih y no es posible hablar de la enfermedad sin embargo tiene todos los ingredientes para que la situaci n empeore amplio uso de drogas inyectables inequidad y violencia de g nero generalizada poca infraestructura y alto ndice de analfabetismo
2555298 cuando termina una guerra las comunidades tratan de reunirse y se observa un aumento de la movilidad incluido el ej rcito pues la gente migra a las ciudades en busca de trabajo se construye infraestructura y de repente el pa s se abre y aumenta las probabilidades de propagaci n del virus
2555299 la lucha por el poder aumenta hay aburrimiento y el sexo es una de las cosas sobre la que los hombres mantienen control eso suele propiciar la violencia de g nero
2555300 la gente suele querer procrear despu s de los conflictos por la cantidad de p rdidas sufridas
2555301 estuve en rep blica democr tica del congo el a o pasado y qued consternada al ver que las violaciones y la violencia sexual eran hechos comunes y que ahora se han vuelto una norma cultural
2555302 fui a m dicos sin fronteras y me encontr con siete casos de ni os violados todos menores de nueve a os
2555303 a menos que todas las organizaciones no gubernamentales y otras agencias sigan comprometidas y sus intervenciones se basen en pol ticas bien concebidas destinadas a mujeres y ni as no podremos hacer frente a la violencia de g nero
2555304 urban living aspects except that we dont have a sidewalk cafe and bodega on the ground floor of our apartment or condo building
2555305 hi im jack and i blog daily about the classic homes historic neighborhoods las vegas history and urban living
2555306 debemos observar los progresos sustanciales que hemos podido lograr pero tambi n el largo trecho que nos falta por recorrer
2555307 en el pasado los gobiernos han sido c mplices en genocidios apropiaci n de tierras masiva degradaci n ambiental y muchos otros abusos negando a los pueblos ind genas sus derechos y libertades fundamentales
2555308 las medidas administrativas o legislativas adecuadas para prevenir los actos de corporaciones transnacionales en territorios ind genas
2555309 generalmente implica el reconocimiento de injusticias pasadas y justicia para las v ctimas
2555310 ofrece la oportunidad para que los estados y los pueblos ind genas fortalezcan sus relaciones promuevan la reconciliaci n y aseguren que no se repita el pasado
2555311 el p blico debe entender los derechos y preocupaciones de los pueblos ind genas y tiene que actuar para protegerlos porque siendo el grupo m s marginalizado del mundo muestra c mo seremos tratados el resto de nosotros tambi n representa la forma m s segura de proteger los ecosistemas que a n quedan
2555312 todos los esfuerzos del gobierno por presentar a la comisi n como otro nuremberg est n completamente fuera de la ley
2555313 hamdan fue condenado sobre la base de leyes aprobadas mucho despu s de que fue detenido y la comisi n permiti que se presentara evidencia obtenida mediante coerci n ambas cosas prohibidas no s lo por el derecho internacional sino por las leyes estadounidenses tambi n
2555314 el juicio a hamdan confirm lo que es de conocimiento p blico las comisiones militares est n defectuosas y no adhieren a los principales aspectos del imperio de la ley
2555315 hasta ahora el juicio perpet a los esfuerzos del gobierno de bush para escapar al imperio de la ley y a los requisitos de la justicia
2555316 el juicio fue un espect culo las reglas para la evidencia est n tan claramente dispuestas a favor del gobierno que el tribunal est incapacitado para llegar a la verdad
2555317 es dif cil darle cr dito a un veredicto aun cuando ste nos est diciendo que el gobierno no pudo ganar todo el caso en su propio sistema artificioso
2555318 esto sin embargo de ninguna manera prueba que el sistema sea justo o que funcione
2555319 este es un gran indicio de que el proceso ha sido independiente
2555320 el tribunal en su razonamiento ha puesto el l mite tan alto que hace pr cticamente imposible que un periodista informe sobre casos judiciales
2555321 esperamos que el proceso y el resultado de nuestra apelaci n vuelva m s claro el alcance de la libertad de expresi n y sus limitaciones en este pa s
2555322 los periodistas et opes tienen instituciones hostiles a su alrededor jueces el gobierno y empresarios
2555323 la ley no protege la libertad de prensa pero da armas a quienes quieren atacar a la prensa
2555324 la conferencia ha sido una buena oportunidad para plantear diferentes enfoques en temas pol ticos y financieros ante el sida pero faltan acciones concretas sobre los c mo y los qu
2555325 es un encuentro tan enorme que a veces uno no puede ver la complejidad el c mulo de relaciones que se establecen y los compromisos que se hacen
2555326 a veces no somos capaces de recibir la informaci n completa de qu es lo que est pasando
2555327 ese acuerdo hist rico es una muestra del nivel de compromiso en la regi n y ser responsabilidad de la comunidad el llevar a cabo la auditor a social para que ese acuerdo sea cumplido
2555328 todos los grupos que se consideran mayormente afectados como los hombres que tienen sexo con hombres y los trabajadores del sexo comercial tienen que participar en las pol ticas p blicas el punto es que de la conferencia salga mayor participaci n de estos grupos en sus pa ses porque nadie sabe mejor su problema que ellos mismos
2555329 en estas reuniones hay mucha ret rica pero faltan medidas especificas y buena parte del trabajo recae en la instancia de decisiones pol ticas
2555330 el sida no sea s lo un tema de cinco d as
2555331 la comunidad de gobiernos organismos internacionales y grupos no gubernamentales sale fortalecida de la conferencia hemos visto el compromiso pol tico de los l deres
2555332 tenemos que construir una agenda de salud para enfrentar el vih y otras enfermedades
2555333 mi evaluaci n de la conferencia es muy positiva para m xico para am rica latina en el caso de m xico la cobertura de medios prensa radio y televisi n fue de tal magnitud que ninguna campa a que nosotros hubi ramos hecho hubiera tenido tal penetraci n
2555334 pero m s all de m xico se logr visibilizar la situaci n de am rica latina porque es un epidemia que normalmente pasa inadvertida y eso hace que el resto del mundo no la tome en cuenta o no la priorice
2555335 a estas conferencias no vienen responsables de tomar decisiones p blicas con la capacidad de firmar algo a excepci n en este caso de los ministros de salud y de educaci n de la regi n el resto de la gente que particip vino con la necesidad de aprender y compartir experiencias esperamos que muchas de las recomendaciones aqu vertidas las tomen en cuenta los pa ses

2555338 on april 28 2006 plaintiff suffered a sudden hearing loss in his right ear vertigo loss of equilibrium and other personal injuries related thereto and has continued to suffer the same injuries from said date through and including the present date
2555339 upon plaintiffs information and belief plaintiffs injuries were caused by electromagnetic radiation emanating from the samsung cellphone and from the motorola cellphone during plaintiffs use thereof resulting from improper and unsafe design manufacturing and production of the samsung cellphone by defendant samsung and of the motorola cellphone by defendant motorola and by said defendants respective failure to adequately warn of such dangers
2555340 motorola takes the safety of its products and its customers very seriously motorola regularly reviews all aspects of product design operation and performance to ensure that its products are safe we do not know the specifics of the allegations in this complaint and obviously have not yet had an opportunity to review and investigate them therefore motorola cannot comment further about the complaint at this time
2555341 more generally we can say that expert scientific panels and health agencies around the world have consistently confirmed the safety of the rf technology used in mobile phones
2555342 the scientific facts are clear that danger looms for users of wireless devices those who live in the vicinity of wireless infrastructure and the general public
2555343 it is a mistake to subject the residents of your community to the dangers attendant to the provision of wireless service that goes far beyond your community usage or need
2555344 this really is wonderful news we are honoured and privileged to receive an offer of help to our community from dr carlo
2555345 in my opinion it is inexcusable that the health protection agency are keeping the lid on this vital debate by continuing to say that mobile phones and masts are completely safe when it is clear to many of us who study the scientific reports that we should be far more precautionary in our use of this technology
2555346 i have good reason to believe that they are doing this because the government is currently earning about 20bn per year in tax revenue from mobile communications and they see short term income as more important than long term health of the population
2555347 this happened before in the 1950s regarding the hazards of smoking it is happening again now
2555348 the government has concluded at least some aids drug experiments involving foster children violated federal rules designed to ensure vulnerable youths were protected from the risks of medical research
2555349 how to start companies to live your dreams or trick yourself into thinking youre living your dreams
2555350 well no offense camille but im going to kick you out of here and make my own decisions from now on thanks

2555352 why yes ive had a few why do you ask
2555353 well cool i guess whyd you track me down to tell me
2555354 because i love you because ive always loved you and ill always love you but im moving in with her and i just wanted to tell you before you found out some other way
2555355 i feel fine about it we havent even talked in a really long time did you think i was waiting around for you or something
2555356 i do so like the kids around here i thought you could make a few friends
2555357 just because theyre scantily clad doesnt mean they want to fuck you
2555358 safe color palette of the townhouse id just left behind
2555359 i cringed over thinking about how provincial people in love really seemed to be when i was young the idea of being in love was exciting and chaotic it was about taking chances evolving and feeling like you could change the fucking world now it was home d cor dogs posing as children the magic of a perfect salad
2555360 yeah you should call some guy you used to date and tell him youre at your bachelorette party and you just want to see him one more time before you get married
2555361 but tell him youre in the room across the way
2555362 do it itll be hilarious youll see him through the peephole looking like an asshole either way
2555363 this was exactly what was supposed to happen youll probably never have to see him again
2555364 we are not letting him in that was not the deal
2555365 it was my call to call him and it will be my call to invite him in its my party
2555366 i feel bad i just want to talk to him tell him im sorry and then hell go okay
2555367 yeah but he didnt use a condom he deserves what he gets
2555368 well i was drunk and besides its not the girls job to have the condom
2555369 you dont really even care about frank you were just being a dumb drunk girl at a bachelorette party if you tell him not only will your wedding be tainted but so will your honeymoon if you decide to tell him wait until after the honeymoon
2555370 yeah i told him and im sorry he wont marry me unless i do this
2555371 madame bear in mind that princes govern all things save the wind
2555372 i think the best answer to this question is to say that
2555373 it looks like a person it really does i think its a ghost
2555374 ill embarrass a democrat any time i get a chance
2555375 but rodgers finds less amusing the half dozen or so times hes been sworn at by favre fans including children as hes stopped to punch in his entry code to enter the players parking lot
2555376 when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me a little bit
2555377 the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f you and the little kids saying swear words i dont understand that

2555382 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
2555383 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
2555384 new book out and making the move to open access
2555385 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
2555386 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
2555387 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
2555388 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
2555389 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
2555390 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2555391 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2555392 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2555393 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
2555394 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
2555395 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
2555396 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
2555397 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
2555398 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
2555399 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
2555400 i see nothing to indicate anything abnormal but you should be getting plenty of exercise beyond that i wouldnt recommend doing anything further

2555402 this is iowa or indiana or illinois this is everywhere and nowhere forever and never yes perhaps this is heaven
2555403 my aortic pump is supersaturated with love filaments for you
2555404 as drought intensification of irrigation and natural hydrological conditions made water increasingly scarce many irrigators were no longer willing to tolerate unregulated use
2555405 gauging just how much water a crop needed was extremely difficult if not impossible and depended on an array of variables soil type temperature precipitation plant variety the typical response to this complexity was simply to soak the land in the belief that the plants would get the water they needed
2555406 farmers did not so much conquer the desert and create a mythic garden as transform the land into a strange new habitat a hybrid mixture of artifice and nature
2555407 irrigators were caught up in ecological relationships that they did not fully understand
2555408 these organisms were integral to and therefore ineradicable from the irrigated landscape
2555409 alfalfa hay that brought as much as 35 00 per ton during the war sold for as little as 2 50 during the following decade
2555410 detroit needs and deserves a mayor who is fully engaged in the business of the city and who is able to lead with credibility and authority we currently dont have such a mayor

2555414 our wounded softened heart right down there in the thick of things we discover the love that will not die this love is bodhichitta it is gentle and warm it is clear and sharp it is open and spacious the awakened heart of bodhichitta is the basic goodness of all beings
2555415 dont you see how one by one death comes to claim your fellow men and yet you slumber on so soundly like a buffalo to its butcher
2555416 lulled into comfort orientation we prefer false security to facing the facts shielding ourselves from the disquieting realities of groundlessness impermanence and death we slumber on so soundly like a buffalo beside its butcher but for how long will this strategy work
2555417 william and kate middleton have been staying at a 5 million gbp villa on mustique and of course a royal insider said rolls eyes
2555418 its the first time they have been seen on summer holiday for 2 and 1 2 years
2555419 it cant mean what i think it means can it
2555420 over 1 5 million children died during the holocaust anne frank was one of them her story is a poignant reminder of the repercussions when ideas of intolerance hate and racial superiority are permitted to exist and society fails to protect its citizens
2555421 this results from how the mind is set in steadfastness or cowardice and so ill scorn all injury and hardships i will disregard
2555422 our first reactions to the world are based on many things history personality and conditioning of all kinds the sight of blood to use santidevas example will make one person faint and another feel strong

2555466 he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier

2555476 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2555477 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2555478 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2555479 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2555480 only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
2555481 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2555482 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2555483 i will get you children i will get you happy
2555484 look i wanna be happy just as much as you want me to be but my life is not flowers and sunshine ive got a lot of cactus and rain to deal with if you would just shut up for a little bit youll see what im talking about
2555485 the average person manages to live all the years of their lives without ever committing murder i managed to live six
2555486 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2555487 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2555488 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2555489 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2555490 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2555491 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2555498 wir wollen einen anderen geschmack im mund haben als in athen wenn wir peking verlassen
2555499 das war damals hart aber ich habe beschlossen aus dieser erfahrung zu lernen
2555500 wenn wir weiter amerikanische staatsb rger bleiben wollen m ssen wir das gold mit nach hause bringen
2555501 wenn ich mit gold zur ckkomme gehe ich auf tour mit der medaille durch all die hei en st dte und feiere hei e partys
2555502 wir waren total abgeschottet wir waren gefangen auf einem boot
2555503 m ssen wir regelm ig raus auf die stra e und das tut uns gut
2555504 ich denke das ist eine v llig andere mannschaft als in athen vor allem in der defensive
2555505 in almost every way we measured new zealand is extraordinarily impressive
2555506 when you ask people how they would feel if they lost connection to the internet only a small percentage say it would be better very few say it would be the same and most say it would be worse
2555507 we dont think theres a business or an activity that is not being affected and most are being transformed
2555508 nang win bagaimana kalau seluruh teman kelas dua dilibatkan menjadi panitia
2555509 iya kalau seluruhnya kurasa terlalu banyak bagaimana kalau kita pilih saja yang menurut kita cakap dan mampu melaksanakan tugas juga yang pantas menjadi contoh adik adik jangan sampai panitia berkelakuan jelek di depan peserta
2555510 tenang saja aku sudah punya rencana semuanya bisa diatur tanpa terlihat terlalu banyak panitia
2555511 untuk para teman teman preman aku kenal mereka semua aku yakin mereka cukup mengerti kalau ini kegiatan keagamaan inysa allah mereka tidak akan membikin ulah

2555513 you know im just not certain if this is an exciting courtroom drama or not
2555514 these people prey in many cases on consumers who are desperate in seeking cures for very serious diseases
2555515 i dont have any sympathy for people who pay for devices like these

2555517 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2555518 why people fight and die for a few square meters yards of land why
2555519 the world powers dont see the situation in the north caucasus
2555520 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2555521 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2555522 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2555523 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2555524 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2555525 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2555526 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2555527 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2555528 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2555529 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2555530 hes the first one to really admit guilt so far as to be where theyre at
2555531 it started with his wife im glad he wont be wasting our money taxpayer money
2555532 you dont forget it sadly a lot of people got hurt
2555533 we didnt expect that many we only had enough for 12
2555534 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2555535 i removed his pistol and put it in the back of my waistband
2555536 i felt so horrible the depth of evil i fell into
2555537 that whole thing then going gay that was a lie
2555538 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2555539 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2555540 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2555541 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2555542 weve also processed quite a bit of llama and some cashmere and some buffalo and various kinds of wool
2555543 the only part of the textile industry that is growing
2555544 we talked about the fact that we sure didnt like the idea of raising animals for slaughter
2555545 that was not going to add joy to our lives and jims work has always been very emotionally taxing we wanted something that was going to add joy to our lives something beautiful having baby goats and the kids born every year the idea of renewal we wanted it to be a place of renewal for both of us
2555546 we shared a history of cancer and death and dying and loss and part of the way of understanding that is that life and death are all part of the same cycles and that life is a journey somewhat like a labyrinth
2555547 that you follow your path not really knowing where youre going to end up and to a certain extent you have to operate on faith and enjoy the moment rather than being completely about your destination
2555548 we didnt realize we were talking about hundreds of pounds of fiber
2555549 if youre holding a handful of kid mohair thats glorious stuff but if you have a hundred pounds of raw mohair thats overwhelming
2555550 it would always come back to i wish there were a mill around here
2555551 shhh tell only your closest friends there is a new fiber processing mill opening in texas in january quick turn around times
2555552 people were trying to come to the mill before the equipment was here it was clear that texas needed a mill
2555553 why people fight and die for a few square meters yards of land why
2555554 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2555555 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2555556 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2555557 imagine the situation the heads of democracies swarmed to beijing to participate in opening ceremonies which took place under martial law
2555558 millions of chinese troops and police are deployed in beijing and everybody is suspect now beijing has become a forbidden city itself
2555559 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2555560 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2555561 the cartilage tends to diminish rather than replenish and our muscle mass tends to decrease and will definitely become tighter if we dont stretch
2555562 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2555563 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2555564 nobody that bought a drill actually wanted a drill therefore if you want to sell drills you should advertise information about making holes not information about drills
2555565 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2555568 the words of songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator
2555569 there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of light objects pattered onto his back when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments glass from the nearest window he walked on the bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 meters up the street he kicked a hand into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd walked down a side street
2555570 heard what he was saying and nipped off to the patrols the next day
2555571 its a moment of truth for this city people are participating new yorkers are united with their city
2555572 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2555573 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2555574 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2555575 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2555576 throughout recorded time there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low the aim of the high is to remain where they are the aim of the middle is to change places with the high the aim of the low is to create a society in which all men shall be equal
2555577 they were down in down in some subterranean place the bottom of a well for instance or a very deep grave but it was a place which already below him was itself moving downwards he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death and they were down there because he was up here
2555578 in the final version of newspeak therell be only six words in reality only one word
2555579 i received 113 000 and a brand new mercedes benz
2555580 well frankly i had thought about it for years i never had the time to do it because of an extraordinarily busy practice of law that took me all over the world but after i had my stroke at age 73 i decided i wasnt going to be able to practice law any more because i couldnt read documents cant charge people for documents you cant read and i thought maybe now i will have time to write that book if i could only read the files and documents that i want to discuss in the book i was fortunate enough to encounter and retain a young princeton senior who said he was willing to be my researcher and colleague for that project
2555581 he was a wonderful boss he was easy to talk to full of compliments when i did something right but didnt get angry when i did something wrong and we found that our ideas and our ideals meshed he never asked me to write or do anything that was against my conscience
2555582 i can still see it in my minds eye we sat on the roof of his chicago hotel i was accompanied by my deputy mike feldman mike had with him a file of little 2 by 4 index cards on which he had jotted down every possible issue that might come up every question he even had kennedys previous statements on them what the democratic platform said on it what the republican platform said on it what nixon had said on it
2555583 oh yes they were included in that enormous batch as we sat there on the roof kennedy was getting his usual sun tan and whether i wanted a sun tan or not i was getting one too thats how we would later do it in the white house prepare for a press conference i would fire one question after another at him and if he felt comfortable that he knew that he would say fine on to the next he never rehearsed a speech and he never rehearsed a debate
2555584 with all due respect to my beloved friend arthur schlesinger whom i miss more all the time kennedys religion may have singled him out yes it certainly got a lot of attention but since most of the attention was negative in electoral terms it was not a net plus it was clearly a net minus he wouldve won by a much larger margin had he been a protestant obama today has only a narrow lead over mccain despite the fact that mccain is a member of the republican party that has seriously damaged our economy our standing in the world even the resilience of our military strength despite all that obamas lead even after his triumphant international tour is under 10 points i can assure you that if he were white his lead would be would be 30 points
2555585 first of all i think obama is counting on the american people to rise to that challenge because the american people are not going to fall for fake phony negative attacks on obamas patriotism look how he demonstrated what he is willing to do in the service of his country when it would be a lot easier for him just to you know rest on his laurels as an a student at harvard law school where he was head of the law review and then have a comfortable position as a partner at a big chicago law firm yet hes out there breaking his back risking his life putting himself on the line subjecting himself to the most scurrilous and nasty kinds of attacks from all the republican right from the swift boaters and even from mccain himself i would call that true devotion to the country on obamas part
2555586 when the sunday new york times magazine a few months ago in their famous q amp a column asked me that very question i immodestly replied ted sorensen age 103 servant of peace and justice
2555587 the single most important decision he will make as president is the most difficult and that is picking a team that team can make him or break him the president cant know everything he cant do everything so during that transition he has to find and attract to public service despite the slings and arrows that are directed toward people in public service these days its not easy you try to judge men and women by their reputations but some people are much better than their reputation and some are not even half as good as their reputation
2555588 i actually dont think race in itself is going to be a defining issue but race becomes another element in the fear mongering campaign that the mccain camp is running meaning hes not like us hes not like us because hes lived in hawaii which is barely america or he has a strange name or he doesnt look like the guys on the dollar bill as obama himself said so its not so much race as such but just the combination of somebody not your typical guy running for president and they are now using that in subliminal ways as well as directly and im sure thats going to intensify as we get closer to the election
2555589 well even back in 1988 mark the first bush campaign handed off the racial dirty work to other people and then denied that they had anything to do with it so even 20 years ago this was kind of a radioactive thing to do look i think obama is having a tremendously healthy effect on race relations generally the result in tennessee is a good example steve cohen didnt just win he trounced nicki tinker after she did those ads cohen being the incumbent white liberal and tinker his black challenger in a majority black district obama came in and denounced her and that was the end of that the black community there rejected that and re elected their white congressman and i think and hope that the reverse will be the same and that white voters and all voters will look at these candidates for the content of their character and the merit of their proposals
2555590 if one of the candidates decides to bring us down to that pathetic trivial level that the mccain campaign chose this week and last week and the media follow as we know inevitably they will then thats where the campaign goes thats really what happened in the last two weeks in fact when paris hilton responded thanks to adam mckay and his team that found her and taped this really funny ad it really showed how dreadful it was that john mccain of all people turned the american presidential campaign into a kind of reality show now of course paris hilton and britney spears if she wants to enter the fray has a legitimate reason to enter the fray at this particular moment honestly i really thought that because this is such a moment of crisis both internationally and domestically it would be much harder to trivialize this election but im being proven completely wrong it may be the opposite that the more serious the problems the more the media want to trivialize the election
2555591 staying above the fray will work very well until the debates come but at that point barack obama is going to have to wind up mccain as tight as he can and make him go off and that may decide the election
2555592 well the interesting thing is that this forgery was in fact created by someone because in december 2003 it was trumpeted on the front page of the conservative
2555593 how to upgrade the existance of your gerbil in 5 real life lessons
2555594 these animals ought to be attended every single day of the week
2555595 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2555596 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2555597 i told the players to concentrate on the game the game always goes on we have to be strong and make sure we play our game and play for the usa we were lucky because there were many supporters behind us
2555598 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries
2555599 but getting that first race under your belt feels really good
2555600 i got the rhythm i wanted just not the time i didnt think i was going that slow when you spend four weeks at training camp you might not be as sharp as you want to be
2555601 its like were playing a big card game and all those guys are showing their hands
2555602 i dont want to be the center of attention in the finals
2555603 i just want to be the guy in the back
2555604 im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2555605 we made history today im proud of myself as well as sada and becca
2555606 i just tried to treat it like any other competition
2555607 it really is a dream come true but im glad its over i did what i came here to do
2555608 it was obviously an honor to have him come and his family come to support our womens team
2555609 he left after the third quarter and we were up by 30 at that point i told him that if he left and we lost that i was going to come find him so he told me 1600 pennsylvania avenue and we of course held on
2555610 we had a slow start in the first four minutes but then we started to get better
2555611 i think we proved today to all the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2555612 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2555613 we accomplished our first set of goals to go out and be consistent and to qualify for team finals we will go through our usual process and review our performances in the prelims and the coaches will meet to determine our line up for the 6 3 3 format in the finals
2555614 usa originally was given three spots for finishing 27th three months later i noticed they had changed our place to 28th a week before the olympic trials i was informed we had three spots two days later i was told that we had two spots we worked with our attorneys at usoc and our national governing body were lifting weights clean and yet we have things taken away from us we played the game clean and are penalized and i think that hurts the most we earned those spots on the field of play and theyre taken away from us we were down at 27th for three months after the qualifying
2555615 hes not eligible to compete at this point we tried to do everything we could do weightlifting is a family and this was just awful
2555616 im almost embarrassed by this situation of not being treated the way we should
2555617 he made the olympic team and it was taken away from him hell make the best of it hell stay and support me and ill support him through the tough times
2555618 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2555619 i dont know what will happen in the future if i can id like to shoot for czech republic as long as possible
2555620 i scored 399 points to the final and im satisfied with it
2555621 but as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2555622 my coach and my teammates of the national team created a good atmosphere which made me perform better
2555623 but i never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china
2555624 we were all at the front working as a unit i was saving my legs for the final lap its like a victory for all of us
2555625 it wasnt because tani was passive i guess she prepared well for this event
2555626 ex 7 write a loop that writes a line of text in each color
2555627 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2555628 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2555629 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2555630 we were immediately impressed by wind river because they took the time to review and analyze our specific needs
2555631 those discussions revealed an opportunity for us to save as much as 40 in merchant processing fees compared to what we had previously been quoted in addition to their on going training and support has greatly surpassed our expectations as we have integrated this application into our business model
2555632 obviously offering a competitive bid plays a big part in our ability to earn business as a government contractor
2555633 at the end of the day though our continued success is predicated on meeting and exceeding customer expectations
2555634 wind river shares this commitment and continues to earn our business everyday by continuing to manage our merchant processing needs as they grow and change
2555635 we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with de arteaga
2555636 their recent growth and accomplishments speak to their commitment to excellence
2555637 na de eerste aardbeving kon de utrechtsengemeente ons direct inschakelen voor het renoveren van de domtoren maar nee ze vonden de nieuwe modern burg bij de hoge catharijne meer prioriteit hebben soms lijkt het alsof ze het oude domtoren weg wilde hebben zodat ze de ruimte aan de rijkenzakenman kunnen verkopen voor een veel geld
2555638 oh its probably just that day the supplier could have given them a faulty load try again another day
2555639 we can live without religion and meditation but we cannot survive without human affection
2555640 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2555641 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2555642 iran would likely launch a crash program to quickly obtain nuclear weapons
2555643 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons
2555644 with ronaldo having scored 25 goals already there is the potential for him to score 30 this season without question
2555645 hes not that far off and has a strong chance im not sure that he is capable of scoring 30 league goals though i think that is a different matter entirely achieving that would be more difficult and its a big ask but if he does manage it ill pay him more money
2555646 when he scored 25 goals the season before no one thought he could do better than that but i felt he could
2555647 i expected him to improve just as i expect him to improve next season of course we are at a different level twenty five goals against 42 is totally different so if he only gets to 41 i will forgive him i am sure he will have a great season
2555648 he might not improve on his goal tally due to his injury and recovery time involved but his general game appreciation will improve
2555649 there is a small glimmer of hope that perhaps things may actually be getting better
2555650 maybe theyll just take the biggest trees theyre old anyway and leave the rest that couldnt make too much difference right
2555651 who would want to do this to our homes our families and our food supply
2555652 if it was just money you wanted or needed why didnt you sell a few acres grandpa if it was our inheritance and you wanted to keep it in the family why destroy it its hardly worth anything to us now overgrown with scrub weeds and half rotted stumps why didnt you just take out some big trees grandpa and leave the rest for another time then the animals could have stayed there too and we would have had a place to play
2555653 grandpa in sunday school today we learned about the 10 commandments
2555654 my hand is the extension of the thinking process the creative process
2555655 the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance
2555656 the essence of all art is to have pleasure in giving pleasure
2555657 we believe that to succeed on such a scale the best strategy is to open up our mobile platform in order to tap the innovation and talent of the worlds developers and publishers
2555658 the lads wanted cristiano to know there was no tension after all the transfer talk they sorted the shirt out earlier this week and couldnt wait to give it to him when he reported back for duty cristiano took it in very good spirit the lads love playing pranks on each other and this was up there with the best
2555659 they are there just to assist in the training of georgia army forces rotating into iraq
2555660 that being said that would not protect them from inadvertent harm caused by the fighting
2555661 its everything from how to put on a uniform to how to fire and maneuver
2555662 we support georgias territorial intergrity and we call for a cease fire
2555663 we want all parties to come to the table to de escalate the situation and avoid conflict
2555664 we are going to send an envoy to the region to engage with the parties in the conflict
2555665 the envoy will join some representatives from our european allies as well
2555666 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2555667 when we first built flock most people uploaded photos on a photo hosting service and embedded them on their blogs
2555668 you dont want to give up on people like that just because they have had a few injuries
2555669 when he is fit louis is an explosive player who will guarantee 20 goals a season louis is on a programme at the moment which we feel will get him to 100 fitness it is more about his confidence in doing this programme which will get him back playing all the time hopefully that is the case because he is such a fantastic player
2555670 we are looking at three or four different options in the striking department which i hope will come to a happy conclusion
2555671 hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2555672 of course everybody wants to play at the highest level i want to play also at the highest level but at this time i am in ajax so i will see what is happening
2555673 we really dont want him to leave and we are going to do everything we can to make sure he doesnt
2555674 i love clubs with great history like ajax i also love united
2555675 its a club that makes me dream especially as ruud van nistelrooy played there and did great things with them i know certain english clubs are following me like manchester united who are very interested in me
2555676 when you look at the ajax salary structure he could get a huge deal
2555677 but he doesnt want to see a release clause set at 25million euros 19 75million in his contract we didnt want to go any lower
2555678 there has been no movement on that front all i know is what i read in the papers we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2555679 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
2555680 this comes after a series of events dating back to last summer which have shown manchester united to be in breach of premier league pl rules as a result we have today made an official complaint to the pl about the conduct of manchester united
2555681 we will see what happens there but we are talking about two very important players
2555682 for the moment they are with us but whatever happens the idea is to have a great squad with the potential to allow us to aim to improve on what we managed last season we have to be realistic and see what we are starting with and who we are competing against there are some big clubs who have spent a lot of money over many years and have a certain advantage in fact they claim they want to sign some of our players at tottenham we have had a clear philosophy regarding buying and selling for years the idea is signing young players promising and talented ones and if important offers for older players are made studying it to see what is the best for the club
2555683 i know for certain manchester united have shown interest in signing dimitar berbatov
2555684 we know the situation of berbatov and we are calm about it
2555685 if a team comes along and pays the asking price the chairman wants then possibly yes but were delighted to have him here
2555686 we are trying to understand what the new manager wants and is trying to bring to the team
2555687 it will be an interesting season after the moves going on here we need to prove we can continue without some players who were key last season
2555688 a lot of people said my transfer to a bigger club was about to happen but i live in the present and im focused on blackburn
2555689 if he fergie comes on asking about santa cruz then ill just tell him hes not having him
2555690 the interest from manchester united is real but im busy now so my representatives will handle anything if there is a concrete offer
2555691 with 40m 31 7m or 50m 39 7m we would sell benzemas ear
2555692 it is not a question of money the player wants to achieve something big in the champions league with lyon he is happy at the club and this can be seen with his latest contract renewal i am sure that he will stay with lyon until the 2010 world cup finals
2555693 i know that there are a lot of interested clubs but he is still young and wants to stay and gain more experience next season he will continue to play for lyon and then we shall see
2555694 in recent months my name has been linked to barcelona real madrid juventus and now manchester united have appeared
2555695 that is high praise and im sure id be able to play in england but i believe my style is perhaps better suited for spain or italy
2555696 that was a great goal nothing you can do about it
2555697 also because ronaldo is there hes my idol hes from another planet but i also love juventus inter and manchester united the big clubs whats important is to win i would leave lyon only to continue to win and when i also feel ready mentally

2555717 well why is the starter here at the same time as my meal
2555718 fearless leader asked the kitchen to send them out as soon as possible and that means both plates came out at the same time

2555738 i think joba and phil should talk to ian and basically throw cold water on his face both have far greater talent than ian but have we ever heard any utterances from their mouths as weve heard from kennedy
2555739 phil and joba have their won things to worry about they cant be concerned about ian
2555740 its the first bad outing ive had since the all star break so im not going to look too much into it
2555741 i talk too much i will learn to stop clogging the board with self indulgent bs
2555742 trisha i agree that you cant convince someone of something that hes not inclined to already however if ian is simply in denial then i do think a chat with his friends might snap him out of it if on the other hand he truly believes everything hes saying then freud couldnt help him and he will end up having a short major league career
2555743 the new thing is a zesty chant by both angel and yankee fans
2555744 i talk too much i will learn to stop clogging the board with self indulgent bs
2555745 what will it take to move giambi from the damn 5 spot what will it take

2555756 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2555757 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2555758 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2555759 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2555760 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2555761 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2555762 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2555763 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2555764 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2555765 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2555766 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2555767 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2555768 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2555769 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2555770 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2555771 when i arrived to work at noon nothing had happened
2555772 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2555773 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2555774 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2555775 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2555776 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2555777 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2555778 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2555779 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2555780 strictly from a psychological standpoint it tells you that there is not a lot of conviction
2555781 fund managers that are hot to buy one day turn around and sell the next
2555782 when you get that steady trickle the market builds on that
2555783 in between what takes the market down is not economic reports sometimes its straight company reports other times its spreading of rumors and fears
2555784 all of a sudden investors have come to the conclusion that europe and u k may be in worse shape than the u s
2555785 its tougher for individuals or corporations to have access to the credit markets
2555786 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean

2555790 to all those booing just wait till my husband gets out of incarceration and i mean that
2555791 i assure you your honor i did not youtube those girls with malice of forethought
2555792 boy a lot of guys must really need that i wonder whats going on

2555799 dick morris is one the most brilliant people on the american scene and were glad hes offering our readers his insights
2555800 with all of the bias in the media it is refreshing to work with newsmax which goes where other media outlets fear to tread
2555801 we are pleased that such a well respected and veteran journalist has been appointed the chairman of our company
2555802 debunks many widely promulgated notions about the global warming threat and finds that truth is the first casualty in gores apocalyptic film
2555803 hollywood nation left coast lies old media spin and the new media revolution
2555804 tales from the left coast true stories of hollywood stars and their outrageous politics
2555805 i dont know i havent seen him lets go for cocktails
2555806 we were made to sit on our heels one foot over the other supported by one foots toes alone for hours some of us were old weak fatigued and injured they were the ones to drop first in the searing caribbean heat
2555807 what happened at guantanamo was torture and it is illegal to provide facilities or anything to make this torture possible under the law european governments should have intervened and should not have given permission to let these flights happen
2555808 its clear to me that guantanamo could not have been created without the involvement of european countries
2555809 these are methods that have been declared as unlawful by the european court of human rights
2555810 inside the plane there was a chain around our waist and it connected to cuffs around my wrists which were tied in the back and to my ankles we were seated but it was so painful not being able to speak to hear to breathe properly to look to turn left or right to move your hands stretch your legs or anything
2555811 our territory may have been used not to commit crimes on it but as a stopover on the way to committing crime in another country
2555812 under the aegis of the un and nato and that portugal naturally follows the principle of good faith in the relations with its allies
2555813 blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies aircraft for military flights related to operations against terrorism
2555814 as an organisation has no involvement or co ordinating role in providing clearance or overflight rights for other flights
2555815 reached no findings regarding any unacknowledged deprivation of liberty conducted by foreign agencies within the territory of the republic of turkey or any transport by aircraft or otherwise of the persons deprived of their liberty
2555816 some european governments its now clear systematically assisted in clandestine flights and illegal prisoner transfers to guantanamo bay we need a full investigation and europeans need to face their responsibility for these crimes
2555817 jonno would have been proud of each and every one of you
2555818 its a hard thing to be spending the night here with jonno
2555819 the men are quite bitter that they couldnt find a helicopter for him
2555820 he told me his leave was cancelled earlier this month but i knew he had offered to stay and take part in this operation against the taliban
2555821 hes a man whose death will leave a huge hole in the regiment
2555822 whatever the situation now is it doesnt mean there isnt going to be a s lot of fighting put your fear to one side be aggressive fellas go for it
2555823 i knew in my subconscious that he was dead already
2555824 but i just felt i ought to do something i didnt want to let go
2555825 but i said something that day and i feel someone looked after me ive said a prayer again this morning
2555826 you know its a risk in what we do we know death may happen and theres no way to really calculate what one mans life is worth
2555827 in this country you get to power because at one stage or another youve done something really awful you cant waste time looking for the good guys
2555828 when you return to musa qala i will most likely be dead
2555829 but we have delivered so little and people will turn on me everything comes so slowly
2555830 but at least here they are on our side they want to go and kill the taliban
2555831 you cant look at him and say that religion or ideology has anything to do with why he is fighting
2555832 the people are like water and the army is like fish
2555833 we have got to learn and learn fast to deliver aid and reconstruction not only when its all quiet and peaceful but under the noses of the enemy while the mortars are still raining in
2555834 all we can do in imposing security is buy time for the afghan government to step up and do its job
2555835 the problem is that we cant and wont stay here for ever things have to move faster
2555836 wed be dead by now if they could shoot straight
2555837 our aim now is to take control of no town that we cannot hold on to unless we can deliver development for the people who live there
2555838 americans have been the victims time and again of suicide attacks
2555839 deliberately forced to drive towards us probably against their will and used as a screen to attack
2555840 they will have to live with this for the rest of their lives
2555841 we had british and estonian lives risked to save the life of two enemy
2555842 what we need to do in musa qala is persuade the people they will be better off under the government
2555843 we have sufficient grounds to declare that the highest state authorities were aware of the cias illegal activities on their territories
2555844 what was previously just a set of allegations is now proven large numbers of people have been abducted from various locations across the world and transferred to countries where they have been persecuted and where it is known that torture is common practice
2555845 now enough evidence to state that secret detention facilities run by the cia existed in europe from 2003 to 2005 in particular in poland and romania
2555846 collaboration at various institutional levels of americas many partner countries
2555847 all the members and partners of nato signed up to the same permissive not to say illegal terms that allowed cia operations to permeate throughout the european continent and beyond
2555848 used to transport people by the cia for torture in other countries
2555849 it was like a big canoe when we arrived we had to swim ashore thats when i lost all my money
2555850 i just got up and ran i left my passport i left my food rations everything
2555851 some were telling us youre al qaeda weve finally caught you
2555852 i said i hadnt but they would tell me youre lying
2555853 he told me he was here to help me but it wasnt true i knew they were there to trap us
2555854 they tried to make me admit my husband was a member of al qaeda
2555855 when we arrived at the airport we were handcuffed and our headscarves were pulled down over our eyes the men were hooded the children were crying all the time saying we want to go home
2555856 theyve concealed their role but you can assume the americans were behind all these renditions
2555857 by sending prisoners to ethiopia they had a convenient place to interrogate people
2555858 whilst hard evidence at least according to the strict meaning of the word is still not forthcoming a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centres have indeed existed and unlawful inter state transfers have taken place in europe
2555859 it is now clear although we are still far from having established the whole truth that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities other countries ignored them knowingly or did not want to know
2555860 the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners
2555861 neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism
2555862 this legal approach is utterly alien to the european tradition and sensibility and is clearly contrary to the european convention on human rights and the universal declaration of human rights
2555863 the most likely hypothesis is that the purpose of this flight was to transport one or several detainees from kabul to romania
2555864 is thus far the only council of europe member state to be located on one of the rendition circuits we believe we have identified and which bears all the characteristics of a detainee transfer or drop off point
2555865 poland cannot be considered to be outside the rendition circuits simply because it has failed to furnish information corroborating my data from other sources
2555866 there was something strange about el masri he didnt behave like the others theyd captured he was asking is he the right guy
2555867 on at least this occasion tenet made the right choice
2555868 he ordered the release of a man who was clearly not a terrorist
2555869 dont send people to countries where they will be tortured
2555870 you can say we asked them not to do it and they do say that but you have to be honest with yourself and say theres no way we can guarantee they are not going to do that
2555871 mr lynch the 100 million defense happened because you brought this frivolous case
2555872 mr lynch the 100 million dollar defense and the 100 lawyers were hired because you brought this frivolous case
2555873 a last bit of advice start looking for a real job this career path is over
2555874 i was out of history my lawyer searched prisons all over egypt and no one could find a trace of me
2555875 i was bleeding bleeding from my face bleeding from my knees bleeding from other parts of my body
2555876 do you want to be an informer for us if you say yes then you can be back in italy in 24 hours
2555877 once i was thrown on the floor and my hands were cuffed to my back and they brought a security agent who mounted my back and slapped on top of me so as to rape me thats when i broke down and i started screaming till i passed out
2555878 sending him back to egypt knowing that egypt practices torture on a widespread scale and knowing that abu omar was wanted by the intelligence services they knew he would be tortured
2555879 the information we had about him was that he was one way or the other an individual who embraced the ideology of jihad
2555880 we owe this man an enormous debt we cant abandon him and his family
2555881 i appeal for anyone with a conscience to help me this is a question of life or death for us
2555882 this information is being communicated in confidence should not be released without the agreement of the british government it is for research and analysis purposes only and should not be used as the basis for overt or covert action
2555883 they were taken out in chains and hooded to separate rooms where there were seven or eight individuals all of whom were dressed completely in black and wearing black masks
2555884 their clothes were cut off nappies were put on them then they were taken in chains to a jet
2555885 it was completely dark they could not see anything there was no light they could not tell day from night
2555886 there were speakers blaring music 24 hours a day that made sleep almost impossible
2555887 we can confirm that the uk did not request the detention of the claimants in the gambia and did not play any role in their transfer to afghanistan and guantanamo bay
2555888 what worries me very deeply is that we might have handed over people to the americans knowing that these people might then have been maltreated
2555889 suspected of being involved in organising large shipments of heroin being imported to the uk by various methods
2555890 a public trial in greece would reveal mr antoniades long career as an informant for customs and excise 1987 to date and put his life at risk from criminal elements
2555891 at this very time we were preparing to target antoniades for significant intelligence led operations how would the germans and greeks have reacted if we subsequently arrested him
2555892 edward questo per te non un granch ma credo ci rappresenti bene questo il nostro primo natale insieme non puoi neanche immaginare quanto io sia felice adesso quando sono arrivata a forks credevo che mai e poi mai avrei voluto restarci ma poi ho incotrato te

2555897 do you want to swim with the dolphins this afternoon burn off the calories
2555898 somebody is going to have to win and somebody is going to lose
2555899 we know who is in guantanamo but where have the others gone
2555900 we cannot tolerate contraband being surreptitiously brought into the camp
2555901 i have never received such an extraordinary letter in my entire career
2555902 i cannot imagine who would want to give my client speedos or why
2555903 is hardly in a position to go swimming since the only available water is the toilet in his cell i presume that nobody thinks that mr aamer wears speedos while paddling in his privy
2555904 the briefs were not issued by jtf guantanamo personnel nor did they enter the camp through regular mail
2555905 have been stripping off to deliver underpants to our clients
2555906 there is no room for error when working in a dangerous environment and constant vigilance is of the utmost importance
2555907 they pushed me down onto the floor of the van there was blood everywhere on my hands my knees
2555908 as we drove along i started to choke it felt like i was dying then i disappeared from history
2555909 somebody came removed the hood removed the cuffs and left me in the shackles
2555910 and that was the dark prison it was a very very cold place you had some sort of odd voices not music playing on speakers you had people coming to check you were alive not ok but alive for the duration of the dark prison i had shackles on i just took it as it came
2555911 you can say we asked them not to do it
2555912 but when you turn someone over to another country you cant say to them this is how we expect you to treat them if you know that this is how this country has treated people in the past you have to be honest that that is going to be a part of it
2555913 there wasnt a bed just a mattress and blanket and a bucket to urinate and defecate in
2555914 we were chained by our legs for a period of about a month after our arrival when they called us for interrogation they bound us by the hands and legs and covered our heads
2555915 the police tried to force me to admit my husband was a member of al qaeda i told them he was just a businessman they kept banging on the table they threatened to strangle me if i didnt tell them the truth
2555916 its called plausible deniability the agency and the bureau are not going to admit that they were witting of this at all but they probably were the power brokers behind the scenes pushing this forward this new era of going onto the african continent and outsourcing interrogation i think is frankly new
2555917 the people in the cia are pretty reluctant about it but theyve got their orders and until america finds a way of actually bringing people to trial in a courtroom people in the cia have got very little alternative to holding them in these black sites secretly or rendering them to allies who will do their bidding

2555921 at present 22 45 mst 18 45 gmt 14 45 edt the entire city of tskhinvali is under the control of the defence forces of the republic of south ossetia now the georgian forces are attempting to break through in the southern suburbs of tskhinvali as a result combat is taking place
2555922 at present south ossetian forces have established control over the largest part of the city and the georgian forces control only pockets in the southern outskirts of the city
2555923 we shall not retreat we shall continue to carry out the tasks that are entrusted to us
2555924 for the last two hours the situation in tskhinvali has been relatively calm
2555925 at present both sides are tensely awaiting the resumption of combat no one hides this fact the georgian side is regrouping whilst the ossetian side is preparing to repulse another attack
2555926 now there is an ominous silence above the city the skirmishes have ceased the city is entirely cleared of georgian military units
2555927 tskhinvali is completely in the hands of georgian troops moreover we control all populated areas in south ossetia except dzhavy and the rokskim tunnel
2555928 the president of georgia is constantly ringing up world leaders and is expressing his anxiety over the situation this is a patriotic war for georgia and we shall not yield even one handful of our soil this is not a conflict over the tskhinvali region it is a patriotic war against russia
2555929 the intensity of the bombardment from all forms of artillery is almost as heavy as yesterday
2555930 at present georgian artillery is firing on the residential areas of tskhinvali it is being accomplished by heavy artillery practically the entire city is coming under fire
2555931 many innocents are going to die because of the hubris of george bush and condoleezza rice

2555955 weve definitely seen substantial changes in the great lakes but we cant tease apart

2555999 we told the chinese that the building should say something about china and its position in the world as an emerging power
2556000 the design itself is not intended to be a visual interpretation of china itself
2556001 the sense of chinese architecture that were trying to bring out is more incidental a sense of axis and symmetry
2556002 you look at the building and to the untrained observer it doesnt say chinese architecture

2556053 he tells me hes clark rockefeller i believe him i havent been shown any hard evidence that hes something other than what he tells me he is
2556054 he tells me he still doesnt remember about the past he remembers bits and pieces silly sorts of things
2556055 he doesnt remember murdering anybody and he doesnt remember being a tenant of the couple that were murdered
2556056 we are now checking if he could be the german citizen christian karl gerhartsreiter

2556061 ive already talked with business people around the country the idea is at least to provide the orchestra with the funds to keep going for an interim period
2556062 some kind of a joint venture with the cbc or a total spinoff
2556063 they have pretty strong management theyre in a changing environment and they have made their decision but that doesnt mean the orchestra has to stop living
2556064 its a national platform for canadian talent and canadian art
2556065 this may be the time for us to think about how a real 21st century orchestra should develop
2556066 to quote barack obama we are and have been an agent of change
2556067 it was a very difficult decision to end the cbcro i hired alain trudel i know what he is capable of

2556078 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them
2556079 my job is a job to make decisions im a decision maker if the job description were what do you do its decision maker

2556083 im going to try to see if i can remember as much to make it sound like im smart on the subject

2556088 were going to well be sending a person on the ground there pretty soon to help implement the malaria initiative and that initiative will mean spreading nets and insecticides throughout the country so that we can see a reduction in death of young children that a death that we can cure

2556090 were also talking to different finance ministers about how we can send a message to the iranian government that the free world is not going to tolerate the development of know how in how to build a weapon or at least gain the ability to make a weapon
2556091 i heard somebody say wheres nelson mandela well mandelas dead because saddam killed all the mandelas

2556094 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2556095 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2556096 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2556097 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2556098 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2556099 one of the reasons i joined the military it was the wrong thing to do but in my mind i was 17 and i was thinking youre a muslim
2556100 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2556101 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2556102 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2556103 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2556104 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2556105 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2556106 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2556107 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2556108 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2556109 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2556118 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2556119 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2556120 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2556201 was going to kill both of them up in here
2556202 will be going over korea netherlands and cuba in the next day you give the guys an idea about the teams were up against its not like they never faced them before we have scouts on korea and netherlands we know cuba pretty well
2556203 it was a beautiful opening ceremony and it takes its toll on a lot of athletes
2556204 a lot of people would say it was spectacular you just relax and get your work in
2556205 i thought the guys attacked it pretty well and we had a lot of guys being aggressive it wasnt as crisp or as sharp as wed like to have it of course it never usually is the first day in full pads but overall the effort was there and it looks like we have some guys that can make some plays
2556206 we had a couple of incidents today that i dont always look forward to
2556207 i like for all of them to be smart injuries or ones you cant avoid but jakes was self inflicted by hitting the ground because he missed a block thats what you call not an intelligent thing itll probably be a week before he can practice and unfortunately hell probably have to slide over to guard now
2556208 my message was a message of experience and a history of doing things in the house of representatives that hit a roadblock in the senate
2556209 theres a need for strong voices in the senate minority and i think i can provide that
2556210 if people in the district dont like what happened that can still change at the primary
2556211 and was to be celebrated fifty days after the feast of firstfruits
2556212 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept
2556213 three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before the lord empty
2556214 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me
2556215 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
2556216 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
2556217 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
2556218 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth
2556219 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away
2556220 until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the christs last instructions to his apostles were of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high
2556221 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
2556222 them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father notice carefully that those which were baptized and filled with controlled by the holy spirit spoke with other tongues languages but this was not the result of asking praying seeking or begging for the holy spirit the holy spirit came at the appointed time to fulfill gods promise that after christ ascended back to heaven he christ would not leave them comfortless john 14 17 18 remember the feast of pentecost was celebrated fifty days after the feast of firstfruits christ fulfilled the feast of firstfruits when he arose from the grave 1st corinthians 15 20 23 he then walked forty days with them acts 1 3 before ascending back to heaven acts 1 9 they were to receive the holy spirit as promised the holy spirit would not have come any sooner or later but only at the appointed time set by god the holy spirit was not the object of mans will by praying begging or seeking but the object of gods will by promise tongues
2556223 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues
2556224 the proof that these tongues were known languages is the fact that
2556225 do you remember what the lord told the church of laodicea in revelation 3 15 16
2556226 believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
2556227 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead
2556228 the soothsayers caused a low sound to proceed as from a grave or a dead person
2556229 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them
2556230 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
2556231 in each case the proper interpretation may be found by reading the whole context and letting other passages shed light on it for example let us look at three
2556232 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all
2556233 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
2556234 i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished
2556235 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
2556236 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
2556237 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
2556238 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another
2556239 the baptizer is not a minister or a body of water
2556240 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
2556241 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
2556242 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name
2556243 whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
2556244 if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you ward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now prophets by the spirit
2556245 ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
2556246 on pentecost and every christian from then until the rapture has been indwelt by the holy spirit
2556247 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you
2556248 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
2556249 as we have noted we are nowhere commanded in scripture to be baptized with or in the holy spirit it is simultaneous with salvation we
2556250 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
2556251 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is
2556252 since we are commanded to be filled or controlled by the holy spirit we never have to pray for it it now becomes a matter of obedience and yieldedness it is not a matter of getting more of the holy spirit but of yielding more of ourselves for the holy spirits use when we are saved we get a new nature in the person of the holy spirit who indwells each believer permanently we still have the old nature which seeks to control our lives controlled by in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
2556253 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
2556254 these groups say paul was not saved yet but paul said in romans 7 22
2556255 does this yes paul was saved when he wrote this when we yield to the holy spirit we are controlled by the holy spirit and the fruits of the spirit will prevail
2556256 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law
2556257 of christ he will suffer loss of rewards but not loss of salvation christian only work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
2556258 no man can come to the me unless the father who sent me makes them want to come
2556259 it was running through my head clean routine clean routine and i must have tensed up a bit but i just got through my routine

2556268 the august 2006 issue of applied and environmental microbiology contained an article written by dr
2556269 forensic application of microbiological culture analysis to identify mail intentionally contaminated with bacillus anthracis spores
2556270 individuals familiar with the compositions of the powders in the letters have indicated that they were comprised simply of spores purified to different extents
2556271 that the spores were produced using additives and sophisticated engineering supposedly akin to military weapon production
2556272 this idea is usually the basis for implying that the powders were inordinately dangerous compared to spores alone the persistent credence given to this impression fosters erroneous preconceptions which may misguide research and preparedness efforts and generally detract from the magnitude of hazards posed by simple spore preparations
2556273 the fbi would not allow beecher to be interviewed about his article
2556274 whoever did it was proud of their biology they grew the spores spun them down cleaned up the debris but there were no additives
2556275 but my friends life is not a bed of roses

2556304 there are some ideological liberals in our community who take to the pulpit to argue that american british and canadian foreign policy is responsible for creating the fertile grounds for violent extremists to germinate
2556305 blaming western foreign policy for fomenting extremism is precisely the argument that ayman al zawahiri and his new sidekick american convert adam yahiye gadahn a k a azzam the american want us to advance to justify their vision of a new jihad world order when we buy in we end up advancing the goals of this fringe group of loud and obnoxious muslim men and women who are hell bent on heralding the end

2556310 for muslims living in the west the future lies not in the tinkering of theology but in the production of culture but how is this process of cultural relevancy to take place is it taking place what are its discernible forms what are the challenges that need to be surmounted before a genuine cultural expression takes root and what and who is to define what is genuine to what extent is cultural output in islamic civilisation a utilitarian exercise in the global village of specialised economies and shared global tastes where does the process of being consumers stop and that of being producers of culture begin what needs to be done to convert western society to associate islam with the beauty of the taj mahal and the majesty of the dome of the rock rather than with the blasted twin towers of new york or the shattered buddhist statues in afghanistan can we develop an agenda of cultural dos that would harness the energy of our young people to teach them that singing creating beautifying and being joyous are all part of the islamic agenda

2556321 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2556322 we have to get them out as early as possible on the third day without allowing them to take a big lead the first session is crucial and from there we have to bat really well and put up a good total remember they have to bat last on this track
2556323 it s a good test match wicket if you are a batsman you have to work hard to get going the bowlers have to bowl in good areas and be patient and wait for batsmen to make mistakes that is what we have been doing and it worked for us on saturday
2556324 the game is evenly poised today a few decisions went here and there but we gave our best we are very hopeful but we have to wait and watch how the game shapes up on sunday
2556325 if what happened in galle happens again then it is fairly even we will obviously be trying to stop them from doing that any lead will be gladly accepted after all this match is turning out to be the closest match of the series

2556365 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2556367 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2556368 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2556373 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2556374 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2556387 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread

2556567 hot or just attractive does she do anything for you
2556568 are you doing a baseball game today or a modeling assignment
2556569 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2556570 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2556571 i told the players to concentrate on the game the game always goes on we have to be strong and make sure we play our game and play for the usa we were lucky because there were many supporters behind us
2556572 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries
2556573 but getting that first race under your belt feels really good
2556574 i got the rhythm i wanted just not the time i didnt think i was going that slow when you spend four weeks at training camp you might not be as sharp as you want to be
2556575 its like were playing a big card game and all those guys are showing their hands
2556576 i dont want to be the center of attention in the finals
2556577 i just want to be the guy in the back
2556578 im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2556579 we made history today im proud of myself as well as sada and becca
2556580 i just tried to treat it like any other competition
2556581 it really is a dream come true but im glad its over i did what i came here to do
2556582 it was obviously an honor to have him come and his family come to support our womens team
2556583 he left after the third quarter and we were up by 30 at that point i told him that if he left and we lost that i was going to come find him so he told me 1600 pennsylvania avenue and we of course held on
2556584 we had a slow start in the first four minutes but then we started to get better
2556585 i think we proved today to all the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2556586 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2556587 we accomplished our first set of goals to go out and be consistent and to qualify for team finals we will go through our usual process and review our performances in the prelims and the coaches will meet to determine our line up for the 6 3 3 format in the finals
2556588 usa originally was given three spots for finishing 27th three months later i noticed they had changed our place to 28th a week before the olympic trials i was informed we had three spots two days later i was told that we had two spots we worked with our attorneys at usoc and our national governing body were lifting weights clean and yet we have things taken away from us we played the game clean and are penalized and i think that hurts the most we earned those spots on the field of play and theyre taken away from us we were down at 27th for three months after the qualifying
2556589 hes not eligible to compete at this point we tried to do everything we could do weightlifting is a family and this was just awful
2556590 im almost embarrassed by this situation of not being treated the way we should
2556591 he made the olympic team and it was taken away from him hell make the best of it hell stay and support me and ill support him through the tough times
2556592 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2556593 i dont know what will happen in the future if i can id like to shoot for czech republic as long as possible
2556594 i scored 399 points to the final and im satisfied with it
2556595 but as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2556596 my coach and my teammates of the national team created a good atmosphere which made me perform better
2556597 but i never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china
2556598 we were all at the front working as a unit i was saving my legs for the final lap its like a victory for all of us
2556599 it wasnt because tani was passive i guess she prepared well for this event
2556600 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2556601 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2556602 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2556603 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2556604 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2556605 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2556606 this is the best im going to do hes a good guy well be very content together he loves me i love him okay please dont say anything else
2556607 i told him i loved him and he said to stay with ryan

2556614 you know you a black mutha fucka when you put fingerprints on charcoal
2556615 the threat here is everything from terrorists to criminals to crazies
2556616 our security is multilayered and weve had to think of every eventuality
2556617 most of the american team is not staying at the olympic village but at a well guarded university campus
2556618 here theyre staying here and were guarding their compound but we are allowing them to have their own security
2556619 the problem is not that we have become too strict the problem is before there were practically no restrictions or control at all
2556620 it was out of control anyone could enter china and we had to bring this under reasonable control
2556621 we will be building a tb tuberculosis aids clinic in ethiopia one we plan for zahara to take over when she is older
2556622 the next trip for our foundation will most likely to be asia to follow up on the situation in burma and our work in cambodia

2556624 he is healthy mentally and physically and will back in the ufc soon they took him in for psychiatric evaluation for 72 hours and what they came back with was that there was nothing wrong with him mentally it was physically he was exhausted severe dehydration and that caused something called delirium

2556637 notwithstanding its affirmative obligation to co operate in reintegration efforts canada the first country to ratify the child soldier protocol and leader in international efforts to protect children involved in armed conflict has done nothing except hide behind vague assurances that omar is being treated humanely assurances the canadian government has known for years to be absolutely false

2556646 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
2556647 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2556648 theres no place for this kind of behavior in the olympic movement and its a shame it continues

2556655 do you remember how people used to walk to each others desks
2556656 this is just alarming because we still do not know why she drank the substance
2556657 we do not have electricity and we made sure no candles or the kerosene stove was on when we left
2556658 at the moment i do not know what the estimated cost of damage is but we lost everything my two children who are in secondary school lost all their uniforms and stationery
2556659 im sure whether were going to rebuild or move away from here after this attack at the moment we really need assistance for my children to return to school
2556660 for the last six months of last year we received a total of 283 reports
2556661 we managed to reduce this number to 108 for the first six months of this year but then this figure jumped out of control in july when we received 62 reports
2556662 many of these cases were a direct result of people being careless and the nfa had to engage resources
2556663 last month we received 40 reports of bush and cane fires some of the cases our machines were dispatched to the scene just to monitor the situation to ensure the fires did not get out of control
2556664 ninety percent of the fires are a result of carelessness and this needs to change especially during this period when we approach the dry season
2556665 as part of our gogreen policy we value giving back to the community
2556666 as one of the worlds largest employers the combined effort of our staff across the region can create tremendous positive impact on local communities
2556667 we hope that dhl volunteer day instills the spirit of volunteerism that transcends a single days efforts
2556668 there have been several cases of deaths amongst children from heart diseases over the past years
2556669 while the ministry of health and organisations like the fiji college of general practitioners and vodafone provide funding for overseas treatment it is not a cost effective option for the long term
2556670 fiji should be moving towards prevention and medication this would avoid the diseases from getting worse
2556671 whether on duty or off duty fire fighters are trained to take charge in emergency situations and this incident was a good example of this
2556672 we are fully committed to engaging in public consultation in order to resolve this matter
2556673 we are working closely with the suva city council members of the public and the department of town and country planning to bring this matter to resolution
2556674 why do they have to build the tower in a residential area
2556675 i will be here for a short time but there are locals living in the area
2556676 according to international guidelines these towers should be built 300 metres away from residential properties and it is not recommended that they erect it on an area where there are young children
2556677 i think its appalling that an international company like digicel would do it here in fiji
2556678 they might say that there is no proof that it affects health but this is unknown
2556679 who knows maybe in 10 years time they will say that it was a cause for cancer
2556680 we anticipate 300 000 to be spent on the hibiscus this year with the setup of the grounds and money going to contractors to do that
2556681 in previous years we used to hold the public judging at the civic centre but this year for the first time everything will be held at albert park
2556682 also all the shows will be televised on television and we are having shows like the acrobats and all other shows
2556683 this year the hibiscus committee and scc are spending 150 000 for an fea pad mounted sub station the new sub station will be permanent and will give us 500kva power so there should be no power cuts
2556684 we are for the draft copy of the charter because it is true in highlighting that the indigenous community needs to be helped greatly in the economic and social areas
2556685 we believe it is time such proposals are re enforced because although it has existed there has not been much done about it
2556686 we said we didnt have a fishing licence because we only go out once in a while to fish and it only lasts one night and licences for one night fishing are unavailable
2556687 even then the wardens insisted we pay the 500 fine
2556688 so we came in our boat to the atm in town and returned with them

2556696 the mark points to its own location and in this process becomes a locus of reference the mark referes to itself the whole refers to itself through the mark
2556697 distinctions are constructed in an empty context a representational space drawing a closed loop on the page for example indicates a distinction apparently cleaving the page into two parts an inside and an outside the page itself however is not torn asunder it remains whole distinctions do not interact with their substrate the representative space has no metric it is devoid of characteristics and thus transparent to operations on distinctions the representational space pervades all distinctions it contains it is both the outside and the inside pervasiveness means that a distinction does not create a cartesian duality context and content are not separated by exclusive or they are associated by inclusive or the representational space provides a unique tool which is not present in traditional notations it can be void unmarked or empty the void cannot be accessed directly since it is not perceptible distinctions provide an indirect access an empty distinction indicates a void content since the void can be indicated it can be used semantically to non represent concepts in the modeled domain boundary mathematics is based on representations of distinctions as containers its origin concept is the void the introduction of a useful void is analogous to the introduction of a useful zero in number systems just as zero overcomes a weakness in roman numerals by permitting efficient algorithms for multiplication the void overcomes a weakness in logical notation by permitting efficient algorithms for deduction

2556703 additionally more focus will be given to infrastructure like electricity water and roads to improve life in the province
2556704 the value of that per annum stands at about 10million
2556705 then there is the stumpage which is calculated at 12 per cent of net profit would be paid out to landowners
2556706 but were trying to have a sustainable program where trees logged will be replaced so the money logging will continue

2556781 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2556782 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2556783 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2556784 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2556785 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies

2556788 non accredited green electricity is very unlikely to make any difference to australias greenhouse emissions or increase the amount of renewable electricity supply
2556789 this electricity generally comes from schemes that have been part of our generating mix for a considerable time and which most australians already unknowingly buy as part of their regular electricity
2556790 living out here i like to call myself the king of tonga
2556791 is that because the property is as big as tonga
2556792 we should immediately convene a meeting of nato to assess the safety of georgia and to consider measures that nato might take in order to contribute to the stabilization of this very dangerous situation
2556793 the international community should deploy a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2556794 russia has long been ready to exercise its aggression on the pro western georgian president mikhail saakashvili to undermine the work of his government and prevent georgia from joining nato
2556795 russia has also been supporting the separatists in abkhazia which is also a georgian territory
2556796 the key issue here is not a conflict between south ossetia and georgia although there are really big problems between them
2556797 however in view of the role played by russia in the world it has a particular obligation to resolve the conflict you must understand that russias present actions in south ossetia and abkhazia resemble the behaviour of the soviet union when it forcefully took karelia from finland it is difficult to imagine that russia would allow anyone to violate its territorial integrity with impunity and georgia is now just doing the same
2556798 transferring the porsche into the family trusts name just days after the bridgecorp collapse was an act of stunning arrogance
2556799 the housing crash is plunging more homeowners into negative equity with their mortgage debt exceeding the value of their property
2556800 what were seeing this time is a lot more mums and dads being hit
2556801 whats changed in this cycle is the number of new zealanders who have an investment property compared with the number in the last downturn that percentage has increased significantly
2556802 transferring the porsche into the family trusts name just days after the bridgecorp collapse was an act of stunning arrogance
2556803 imagine if that 5 3b had been invested in new zealand infrastructure
2556804 elderly investors watching billions of dollars leak from their retirement nest want answers from the government their financial advisers and the directors of the troubled finance companies they invested in
2556805 thats a hang of a lot of money financial advisers cant sort out that sort of thing overnight
2556806 for retired people when its their entire nest egg its devastating
2556807 transferring the porsche into the family trusts name just days after the bridgecorp collapse was an act of stunning arrogance
2556808 the first port of call for any receiver would be to look at whether the companys leading lights had tried to tuck away personal assets into either trusts or their spouses name transferring the porsche into the family trusts name just days after the bridgecorp collapse was an act of stunning arrogance if anything was bound to rankle with creditors this was it even the court of appeal has suspicions about the ownership structures petricevic has used the official assignee and the bridgecorp receiver will now be able to look behind the trust veil and determine whether it is in creditors interests to challenge the structure they will have to weigh up the costs of any legal challenge against available returns but irrespective of whether they can recover major amounts or not they should go ahead there have been too many instances of unsophisticated small time investors who havent put their key assets into trusts being forced to sell up because of the collapse there is an issue of equity here if the receiver does not pursue petricevic with all its might yet goes hard after the small investors it just reinforces the notion that a business person whose imprudence costs others their savings can still come out the other end with assets intact in petricevics case this would no doubt compensate for the damage to his reputation petricevic is vulnerable because of the assertion that bridgecorp collected 92 5 million from investors in the five months before the collapse and the claim that it had just 45 000 available to pay 2m due to investors on april 13 three months before the failure was notified
2556809 imagine if that 5 3b had been invested in new zealand infrastructure
2556810 just imagine if at least some of that 100b still in banks and finance companies could be invested in infrastructure unlike other countries new zealand doesnt have a large and vibrant market for corporate and government bonds that would allow regular investors to invest long term in assets returning more than bank account rates

2556814 the force level that we have in afghanistan is one that was placed there on advice to do the job that we want it to do
2556815 and i have twice or three times now increased that force level i am willing to do that if thats the military advice
2556816 we are not doing that to release additional troops to afghanistan
2556817 we are i think being stretched by the fact we have two medium sized operations going on i dont make any bones about that
2556818 but if in the future that happens and thats what the military say they need we have never previously said they are not going to be given it
2556819 we have to go with what they say they need
2556820 the troops out here have had a very difficult june and july those have been tough months for them and we have paid a high price over those months for the progress we have made

2556949 vvs laxman has sprained his ankle and tendulkar hyper extended while fielding and jarred his elbow while ishant landed on glaute buttocks and it is painful from the impact
2556950 in nepal the maoists learned from their experience that in 21st century one cannot ignore democracy and then they decided to join the process the decision came out from their own experience
2556951 in any appeal to maoists they should be told to learn from the indian experience
2556952 although the upa and nda somehow managed to stall me from becoming the prime minister but the developments helped the party achieve in six days what it would otherwise have managed in six to seven years
2556953 we are contemplating a review of the existing content code as it needs to be at par with changing times
2556954 instead of opposing it they should discuss the matter with government
2556955 delhi high court has asked for our views on content code and what we have done about it the ministry will send its reply by september
2556956 we have given licenses to 33 new tv channels this year this shows our liberal attitude towards television channels

2556960 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia

2556963 we want to meet the central panel and put forth our point of view over agitation and demand of restoration of land to the shri amarnath shrine board sasb
2556964 we have to make the central leadership aware of the facts
2556965 over the next two years the company will be putting in usd 2 billion for setting up nationwide gsm network we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2556966 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators
2556967 now there is an environment full of opportunities and india is being admired around the globe
2556968 youngsters have to finally achieve the dream of former president apj abdul kalam becoming a developed nation youngsters must work to wipe out the tears of the poorest of poor he said
2556969 one should work hard to achieve a vision larger than life and its not an easy thing
2556970 when we started infosys in 1981 we decided to become the most respectable company rather than mere focussing on becoming a profitable company if you want your people to sacrifice then you need to first sacrifice he said
2556971 if u want your organisation to grow from strength then hire best quality people
2556972 our doors are open for talks we can meet anytime but there should be concrete proposals regarding restoration of land to amarnath shrine board and removal of the jammu and kashmir governor
2556973 we will definitely go as our doors are open for talks but there should be an agenda for talks some concrete proposals
2556974 we had put forth our demands including restoration of land to shri amarnath shrine board sasb removal of governor and compensation to those who lost their lives in the agitation
2556975 besides we raised with the panel environment of oppression and suppression imposed upon the people of jammu by administration and police led by the governor n n vohra
2556976 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2556977 the china of the future will reflect its own culture and traditions but it will also reflect the universal aspirations of mankind and theres no deeper human desire than liberty
2556978 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2556979 hamas movement must rule in gaza and the occupied west bank according to the results of the elections
2556980 the reconciliation is the mechanism of the dialogue but ramallah is not ready for reconciliation now
2556981 we are aware that rape scenes are portrayed in a titillating manner in current bollywood films
2556982 it is true that the rape scenes are highlighted in the films today but side by side the stigma is a reality of our society
2556983 on the one hand the victims face mental trauma which persists with them for all their life and on the other they face humiliation from society as well
2556984 we have to make the central leadership aware of the facts
2556985 we have not allowed yatra and delegation to enter jammu and kashmir as there is curfew in kathua and adjoining areas
2556986 i pointed out what needs to be done by this cpa the uk will support the new chairman to reach that aim
2556987 quid pro quo which i understand had been agreed upon three years ago
2556988 required to obtain a fresh vote of confidence from the parliament
2556989 otherwise the parliament being a sovereign and independent body has the option to exercise the right to impeach him
2556990 should prolong his stay in office against the wishes of the people
2556991 the cpi m led state government has denied bringing in crpf personnel to nandigram in order to give a free rein to their cadres there who don police uniform to torture the villagers
2556992 we have made our position clear that we will not have any ties with the parties which had relationship with the congress and the bjp it is for them to take a decision
2556993 film producers are seeking my permission to produce films based on my stories
2556994 even now i had donated rs 25 lakh the fee i got for my recent film oliyin osai for the welfare of indigent artistes
2556995 i had visited the southern districts of the state two days back to attend government functions like inauguration of tuticorin municipal corporation
2556996 i did not play my usual game and hit less smash instead i was trying more drop shots the first round match is always tough because you tend to make mistakes early but im happy that everything went according to the script
2556997 when a stock goes their way they tend to take profits too soon out of insecurity and fear when a stock goes against them they grimly hold on not knowing what to do with a puppy that is fouling up their living room and chewing up their couch
2556998 it feels nice to lean back and drift into a vague fantasy of riches sitting up straight on a hard back chair and writing down your specific goals as well as a contingency plan robs you of that vague fantasy
2556999 but first in order to benefit from your experience you need to survive and stay in the game long enough to learn to play it well
2557000 even if the price is reasonable acting on a random tip is not a very effective way to select a stock instead why not buy the best possible stock for your investment goals rather than just an okay stock
2557001 all stocks in the database are then filtered through that screen and only those that match your requirements are allowed through it is similar to using a matchmaking service to search for an ideal date
2557002 unfortunately money is more often misused and abused than used intelligently financial insanity has developed its own big following
2557003 you may pinch pennies when buying food at the market on payday but later blow whats left on gadgets that you could easily do without
2557004 too many people spend money they havent earned to buy things they dont want to impress people they dont like
2557005 but consistent irrational behaviour with money is detrimental to our personal and financial well being
2557006 you will have to work only half as hard as the general population to lead a full relaxed happy and satisfying life
2557007 punjabi music has been the soul of singh is kingg mehndi told pti

2557055 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2557056 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2557057 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2557058 is to enable a creative environment where theres a good degree of experimentation
2557059 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2557060 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2557061 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2557062 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2557063 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2557102 asset quality remains manageable with non performing loans aggregating 4 3 million at june 30 2008 which represents an approximate 700 thousand increase from the 3 6 million in nonperforming loans at year end 2007 the underlying collateral real estate of one loan previously included in the non performing category has been transferred to other real estate owned as a result of foreclosure in june 2008 in the amount of 2 4 million a july 2008 appraisal shows a 2 9 million value substantially all of the 4 3 million in non performing loans is real estate secured with current appraisals none performed beyond one year which all exceed the book or carrying values as further comfort

2557124 the roosevelt truman and eisenhower administrations had unsuccessfully lobbied congress to legalize national security wiretapping in 1941 1951 1953 and 1955 their failures did not influence their policies on such uses

2557187 on behalf of the hnd and the hmong community we staunchly condemn the brutal and corrupt lao military regime including the military and communist party leadership for their ongoing massacre and mass starvation of innocent hmong civilians in laos
2557188 we want these lao military and party officials to immediately cease these deplorable attacks including lao helicopter gunship s strafing and rocketing hmong villagers which have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent hmong women and children in recent months
2557189 key lao government and military officials should be charged with crimes against humanity and brought before the international court andtribunal in the hague netherlands for war crimes genocide crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing especially for their killing and mass starvation of the hmong people
2557190 currently the lao regime with the help of vietnam s troops is engaged in major security force and military operations against unarmed civilians and dissident groups

2557194 but the sheer depth of most individual voters ignorance is shocking to observers not familiar with the research

2557196 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization
2557197 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2557198 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2557199 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2557200 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2557201 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2557202 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2557203 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2557204 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2557205 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2557206 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2557207 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2557208 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2557209 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports

2557684 la nato resta molto preoccupata di questo non c dubbio e il suo segretario generale continua a credere che tutte le parti coinvolte debbano immediatamente mettere fine alle operazioni militari e cominciare a trattare
2557685 le trattative a cui facciamo appello come altri possono unicamente essere fondate sullintegrit territoriale della georgia
2557686 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2557687 georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated
2557688 our athletes are doing what theyve prepared for years theres no politics

2557693 he said that brian went over to the house and came back and told him that he had shot them both he said that brian shot the female several times because she was gurgling and she might not be dead
2557694 when you start to come down from that high you become sometimes hallucinogenic paranoid and obviously very aggressive and thats what we see here incredibly aggressive behavior by people who dont have any of the normal boundaries that we would have

2557743 hold a dialogue about reform and to try the symbols of corruption in whose lap the deposed president had thrown himself
2557744 but the officers were smart enough and spoiled the plan of the deposed president and his aides with plans that were the first threads of the coup when the army officers went to get backing from parliament and the senate tried to bring the symbols of corruption to an islamic court of justice and demanded the funds seized by the deposed presidents wife which represented all the friendly arab countries aid to the mauritanian people
2557745 but the deposed president rejected this and exploited the officers absence to issue a decree dismissing the states most important and strongest symbols who sought change these officers had no choice but to arrest the president his interior minister and the prime minister
2557746 demonstrations were staged yesterday in mauritanias streets carrying photos of the new president gen ould abdelaziz
2557747 this coupist action has internal support and is called a corrective movement it has received unprecedented support from the tribal symbols and a majority of the mauritanian parliaments members as well as from many elites in the ruling party only five deputies remained with the deposed president
2557748 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2557749 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2557750 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2557751 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2557752 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2557762 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2557763 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2557764 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2557765 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2557766 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2557767 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2557768 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2557769 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2557770 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2557771 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2557772 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2557773 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2557774 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2557775 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2557776 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2557777 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2557778 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2557779 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2557780 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2557781 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2557782 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2557783 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2557784 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2557785 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2557786 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2557787 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2557788 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2557789 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2557790 if your father had a heart attack at age 27 and you have the same lipid profile as your dad whats the greater risk
2557791 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2557792 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2557793 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2557794 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2557795 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2557796 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2557797 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2557798 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2557799 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2557800 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2557801 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2557802 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2557803 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2557804 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2557805 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2557806 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2557807 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2557808 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2557809 es algo que me marcar para toda la vida ha sido un xito para m y para toda espa a los deportistas tambi n son seres humanos y me emocion me acord de toda la gente que ha estado a mi lado y no me lo cre a tantos a os de trabajo y al fin llegaba la recompensa

2557830 it serves a short term goal but in the long run it makes kids like broccoli less and ice cream more
2557831 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2557832 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2557833 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2557834 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2557835 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2557836 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2557837 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2557838 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2557839 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2557840 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2557841 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2557842 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2557843 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2557845 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2557846 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2557847 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2557848 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2557849 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2557850 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2557851 estoy muy contenta v que los tiempos de las series anteriores eran muy buenos la ltima serie me sale cada vez mejor la verdad es que no me di cuenta de que iba primera tras la mariposa aunque luego vino la espalda en el viraje de braza me he visto cuarta o quinta y en el ltimo de libre no notaba las piernas ya que he ido todo lo m s r pido que he podido

2557906 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2557907 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2557908 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2557909 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2557910 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2557911 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2557912 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2557913 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2557918 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2557919 if it was high enough at the time it would have been able to see the battle of culps hill
2557920 would have been able to see the union guns there on the crest of cemetery hill firing at picketts men
2557921 and looking to the south it could have seen the entire union line stretching from cemetery hill to the round tops
2557922 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2557923 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2557943 mr darwish has died at 1 35 pm 1835 gmt
2557944 were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2557945 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2557946 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2557947 in the end it turned out that samuel felt the best and so we played his card
2557948 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2557949 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2557950 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked
2557951 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2557952 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2557953 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2557954 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2557955 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2557956 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2557957 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2557958 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2557959 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife

2558059 i have no fear of entering the world of contemporary music as i dont think it will alienate most of my fans i think that because i know a lot of my fans not only my own personal fans come into my music with an open mind but i know a lot of them openly enjoy more than just the genre of hard rock music so therefore i can go into something a little more contemporary i can go into something ive been dreaming of doing for a long time i just didnt have the tools and the team to do it so to speak but more importantly its the idea of finding a new and different audience who dont know who i am
2558060 this is an album for people who never heard of jeff scott soto and for the most part i think ive said it in a few blogs and interviews before most of my fans will follow me in what i do theyve been pretty open to what ive done from love parade onward but this is a whole other chapter of what im about and instead of taking just one genre of what they know me as and another genre of what they know me as im kinda putting it all into just one big stew and mixing it up this time its hard to really talk about a new album and categorize it or separate it from your entire career but this really does sound and feel like a separation from everything ive already done
2558061 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile

2558066 undercutting the courts ability to get anyone to obey its orders

2558068 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2558069 it is forbidden to interrogate sick people for military purposes
2558070 there is no conditioning whatsoever between receiving an entry permit to israel for humanitarian purposes and the willingness of that individual to provide information of any sort aside from about his medical condition

2558079 los plazos se est n cumpliendo y no puedo decir m s porque el proceso es reservado lo nico que puede asegurar es que estamos trabajando muy seriamente con un cronograma que hemos venido ejecutando desde el primer momento desde antes incluso de la presentaci n de la demanda y por eso las cosas est n saliendo muy bien

2558085 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2558086 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2558087 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2558092 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2558093 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2558094 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2558100 yo me pregunto qu m s necesitamos para que la gente se vuelque a la calle mi llamado es a convertir la rabia y la frustraci n en una energ a muy poderosa que nos lleve a una victoria contundente electoral en la calle el 23 de noviembre que ese d a gane la democracia y recuperemos nuestros espacios

2558107 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2558108 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2558109 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2558110 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2558111 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2558112 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2558113 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2558114 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2558115 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2558116 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2558117 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2558118 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2558119 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2558120 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2558121 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2558122 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2558123 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2558124 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2558125 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2558126 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2558127 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2558128 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2558129 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2558130 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2558131 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2558132 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2558133 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2558134 if he doesnt shake it up whats going to happen in the next election
2558135 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2558136 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2558137 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2558138 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2558139 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2558140 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2558141 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2558142 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2558143 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2558144 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2558145 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2558146 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2558147 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2558148 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2558149 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2558150 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2558151 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2558152 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2558153 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2558154 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2558155 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2558156 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2558157 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2558158 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2558159 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2558160 just so you all know we did set a record
2558161 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2558162 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2558163 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2558164 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2558165 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2558166 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2558167 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2558168 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2558169 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2558170 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2558171 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2558172 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2558173 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2558174 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2558175 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2558176 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2558177 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2558178 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2558179 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2558180 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2558181 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2558182 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2558183 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2558184 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2558185 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2558186 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2558187 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2558188 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2558189 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2558190 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2558191 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2558192 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2558193 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2558194 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2558195 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2558196 this is probably the first time weve put out a severe weather warning for this sort of thing
2558197 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2558198 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2558199 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2558200 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2558201 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2558202 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2558203 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2558204 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2558205 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2558206 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2558207 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2558208 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2558209 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2558210 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2558211 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2558212 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2558213 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2558214 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2558215 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2558216 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2558217 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2558218 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2558219 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

2558223 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2558224 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2558225 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2558226 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2558227 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2558228 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2558229 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2558230 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2558231 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2558232 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2558233 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2558234 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2558235 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2558236 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2558237 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

2558242 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2558243 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2558244 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2558245 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2558246 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2558247 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2558248 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2558249 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2558250 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2558251 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2558252 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2558253 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2558254 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2558255 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2558256 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2558257 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2558258 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2558259 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2558260 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2558261 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2558262 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2558263 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2558264 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2558265 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2558266 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2558267 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2558268 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2558269 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2558270 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2558271 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2558272 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2558273 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2558274 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2558275 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2558276 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2558277 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2558278 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2558279 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2558280 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2558281 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2558282 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2558283 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2558284 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2558285 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2558286 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2558287 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2558288 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2558289 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2558290 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2558291 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2558292 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2558293 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2558294 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2558295 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2558296 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2558297 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2558298 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable

2558300 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2558301 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2558302 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2558303 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2558304 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant

2558307 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2558308 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2558309 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2558310 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2558311 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2558312 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2558313 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2558314 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2558315 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2558316 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2558317 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2558318 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2558319 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2558320 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2558321 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2558322 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2558323 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2558324 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2558325 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2558326 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2558327 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2558328 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2558329 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2558330 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2558331 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2558332 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2558333 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2558334 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2558335 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2558336 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2558337 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2558338 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2558339 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2558340 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2558341 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2558342 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2558343 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2558344 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2558345 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2558346 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2558347 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2558348 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2558349 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2558350 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2558351 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2558352 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2558353 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2558354 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2558355 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2558356 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2558357 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2558358 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal

2558368 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2558369 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2558370 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2558371 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2558372 no no no his middle name cant be wally that just wont cut the mustard we need to make it into something a little more suave say for instance walker yes walker thats a suitable middle name closely related to wally but with a more chuck norrisy sound to it it makes him sound like a tough as nails kind of wally
2558373 like a dumb dog with its tongue lolling out of the side of its mouth frantically humping your leg
2558374 keith moon keith moon is who id rather drink with and keith and i would go pick up bon scott and john belushi and head on over to the playboy mansion for a night of drunken drug fueled whore mongering

2558376 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2558377 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2558378 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2558384 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2558385 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2558386 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2558387 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2558388 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2558389 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2558390 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2558391 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2558392 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

2558395 inflicting small amounts of physical pain whether from scratching your skin vigorously or doing something more extreme deactivates the parts of your brain associated with unpleasant or painful emotions
2558396 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2558397 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2558398 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2558399 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2558400 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2558401 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2558402 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2558403 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2558404 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2558405 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2558406 real results by the end of my first term in office
2558407 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2558408 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2558409 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2558410 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2558411 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2558412 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2558413 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2558414 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2558415 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2558416 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2558417 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2558418 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2558419 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2558420 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2558421 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2558422 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2558423 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2558424 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2558425 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2558426 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2558427 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2558428 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2558429 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2558430 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2558431 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2558432 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2558433 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2558434 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2558435 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2558436 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2558437 its so hard when i have to and so easy when i want to
2558438 now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant and he the servant said unto him
2558439 the question should be is it worth trying to do not can it be done
2558440 it is not a beautiful design it carries little iconic or monumental significance but sheer muscular and massive presence
2558441 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved
2558442 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began
2558443 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
2558444 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
2558445 to the world you may be just one person but to one person you may be the world
2558446 i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right wel
2558447 but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
2558448 6 are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god
2558449 press on nothing in the world can take the place of perseverance talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb education will not the world is full of educated derelicts
2558450 make your own rules believe what you want do what you want
2558451 strive to enter in at the strait gate luke 13 24
2558452 i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
2558453 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
2558454 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2558455 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
2558456 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2558457 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2558458 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2558459 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2558460 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2558461 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2558462 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2558463 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
2558464 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
2558465 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2558466 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2558467 ya know what i aint gonna lie for the first time in my career i honestly had a bad feeling going into a match i didnt know what it meant or who it may involve but i just had a feeling that something was gonna go wrong that night i just never would have thought it would have been me laying there the way i was
2558468 not alot seeing as seconds before i had just had my face rammed into a solid steel cage wall not a lot of time to rationalize whats goin on
2558469 actually there was no feeling at all i did hear a popping sound on impact but im guessing i was knocked out since i couldnt remember rolling over soon as i came to i was looking at the ceiling and realized i couldnt move not my legs not my arms nothing
2558470 i knew something was wrong but had no idea what i just knew that i was trying to move and it wasnt happening and for the record my neck was never technically broken its just easier for people to see it that way the doctors talked about compacted vertabraes and torn ligaments and stuff and even said it was close to the same kind of injury that paralyzed christopher reeves
2558471 i remember bits and pieces but since then i have watched the footage from the match and filled in the missing parts i dont know if i kept blacking out or if i was too focused on what was wrong with me i dont know
2558472 well you run that risk with any move in professional wrestling ive seen people break ankles with a baseball slide knees blown out from delivering a dropkick and a move thats designed to drop you on your head only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt
2558473 i cant fault a man for doing what he had to do to try to win the nbwa heavyweight title watch the footage right place right time and he capitalized yeah i got hurt but if the roles were reversed i guarentee i would have and still would do anything in my power to once again be called champion
2558474 he knew from the start he was no champion i was the biggest threat he had for that title and he knew then and he knows now that he cannot compete on my level it took and i stress this the entire locker room to defeat me for my heavyweight championship last summer and don kato was just the final piece to the puzzle again right place right time he capitalized but in a bitch way i expected nothing less of him than to try and steal the spotlight while im laying there motionless in the middle of the ring i just hope he understands karma
2558475 that one act could have saved a lot of people the same fate i had
2558476 i dont really know i know they opened me up and put a wire in my neck but thats about it
2558477 oh no i couldnt move for a good 10 15 minutes even then it was very little
2558478 it was a day or two before i could move anything on my own even longer before i could actually control it
2558479 a week after the injury then another week after the surgery
2558480 texted and watched cartoons it may seem kinda dumb but the doctors said that i needed to use my motor skills as much as possible to strengthen them back up he suggested video games but my cell phone was a nice substitute and the cartoons helped me keep my mind positive
2558481 eventually yes but nowhere near as fast as i did
2558482 it was just not my main priority i wanted to make sure i could walk and live a normal life first but wrestling is in my blood and i knew that if i could do that much then it was only a matter of time before i was back in the ring
2558483 terrible i was always on the move wrestling gymnastics working out dance all of it was taken from me at once it took time to recover
2558484 just one step at a time taking it slow trying to get back to the way things used to be
2558485 well i thought about coming back as soon as i was lying in the hospital bed i told you its in my blood and i have been rehabing myself to one day come back but don kato took it upon himself to force me back now im gonna do whatever it takes to prove to issan hadeev and don kato that there aint nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal
2558486 they hate it every one of em theyve all tried to talk me out of it but it cant happen this time this time i have something to prove something to don kato something to my fans and most importantly something to myself
2558487 what i did was help out a friend issan took it too far with his assault on cobra and i had enough don kato then put me in a match with issan himself and no matter how i got into the situation im a man and im not gonna back down

2558497 the song was a hit and the words lynch and racism has never come up until this moron wrote this blog
2558498 colberts studio audience clapped to the beat blithely unaware that they were swaying to a racially tinged explicitly pro lynching anthem that calls for the vigilante style hanging of car thieves and other assorted evildoers
2558499 grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that hed done take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
2558500 during the days when keiths grandpappy stalked the jim crow south lynching was an institutional method of terror employed against blacks to maintain white supremacy
2558501 its about the old west and horses and sheriffs and going and getting the bad guys its not a racist thing or about lynching
2558502 tzu kung asked is there a single word which can be a
2558503 8 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law 9 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
2558504 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head 1 no one likes to have their mistakes errors etc pointed out 2 when necessary wouldnt we prefer to be approached with a meek and patient spirit 3 as you would have others offer you constructive criticism so brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted 2 bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ
2558505 the golden rule would reconcile capital and labor all political contention and uproar all selfishness and greed
2558506 we have committed the golden rule to memory let us now commit it to life
2558507 12 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
2558508 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 9 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
2558509 3 and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience 4 and patience experience and experience hope
2558510 in the difficult are the friendly forces the hands that work
2558511 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
2558512 10 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
2558513 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
2558514 13 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
2558515 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2558516 president bush is paving the way for the chinese authorities to further clamp down on religious freedom instead of fostering it as he claims
2558517 by going to pray at the church president bush is endorsing chinese state control of religion which will stifle the growth of independent religious groups in china
2558518 we call for the release of chinese journalists and human rights activists who have been imprisoned and for the end of harassment of those who have been placed under surveillance or forced to leave beijing
2558519 an attempt has to be made so that at least one third women members may be included in any tier of the party
2558520 besides the congress has decided that presidium members and secretaries of the party cannot remain in any other profession
2558521 in order to attain revolutionary democratic changes in society and state to pull the country from the present crisis the ninth congress has targeted three steps as its main tasks
2558522 these three are outside the bourgeois stream an alternative left democratic force having ability competence and confidence of the masses has to be built up so as to help control state power the party will popularise the mass oriented programmes that serve the causes of the people in addition to anti imperialist move finally it will strengthen the alternative forces that can weaken the authority of the existing class in power
2558523 we will participate in the national elections if such climate prevails we have no objection to upazila elections if it does not disturb the national elections we are in favour of local elections
2558524 we have already been seeing attacks in the wild for the past two weeks
2558525 playing russian roulette with a gun that has 100 bullet chambers instead of six
2558526 should be to take the gun out of peoples hands
2558527 they are relying on infrastructure that was not intended to do what people assume it does
2558528 what makes this so frustrating is that no one has been listening to what we have been saying for the past 17 years
2558529 dnssec is not an overnight solution for the kaminsky problem but its the right solution in the long run
2558530 i think it going to be a fight with the river

2558534 it hardly seemed like a significant event the vote was held under a state of emergency candidates could not compete under party labels one party leader was in jail another in exile
2558535 but these were also the first polls held since the army installed a civilian government in january 2007
2558536 fears that the military would rig the result proved unfounded
2558537 for the first time bangladeshis saw a voting system that seemed to deliver a fair and credible outcome
2558538 the vote made clear that the army has lost or given up the ability to influence the parliamentary election scheduled for december
2558539 t alk of setting up a national security council to formalise the armys role in politics after the vote
2558540 t hree things make a return to civilian rule more likely one is the confidence of the awami league itself
2558541 the next is a split in the leagues main rival the bangladesh nationalist party bnp at least one faction no less desperate to return to power than the awami league is likely to defy her call to boycott the general election too
2558542 the army backed technocrats who run the country are drifting unable to take big decisions
2558543 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2558544 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2558545 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2558546 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2558547 thwart its neighbors movement toward western society and western values
2558548 russia has clearly decided to redraw the borders of the eastern europe map of the post cold war situation
2558549 if the world is not able to stop russia here then russian tanks and russian paratroopers can appear in every european capital
2558550 we still believe that a unified and consolidated western pressure and western opinion can bring some fruit
2558551 those who have been supplying arms to georgia they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life
2558552 who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis intentions and helped create the feeling of impunity inside the georgian should think twice about whether this is right
2558553 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded
2558554 quite a number of officials in washington were really shocked when all this happened
2558555 those who have been supplying arms to georgia they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life

2558559 components of the cost includes expenses like health care displacement legal services fees and lost workdays
2558560 even the law enforcers discourage the victims to file a case against their husbands
2558561 we have taken initiatives to include gender equality issues in school text books in a bid to increase awareness
2558562 the swiss government maintains a zero tolerance policy towards domestic crimes such as domestic violence with physical injuries must be prosecuted by the state as soon as they are aware about it
2558563 two years ago i made a very serious mistake which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2558564 i think it going to be a fight with the river
2558565 i dont want to think about any results i just want to fight with the river

2558580 maar gisterenavond liep het helemaal uit de hand de actie was totaal onvoorbereid en ongeco rdineerd er waren veel te weinig matrassen zon honderdtachtig voor de bijna driehonderd bezetters zodat het tot verbale en bijna fysieke agressie kwam
2558581 een actie in dergelijke omstandigheden kon alleen maar slecht aflopen en kon alleen maar slecht zijn voor hen en voor heel de beweging daarom heb ik hen duidelijk gemaakt dat ze vandaag tegen twaalf uur de kerk moesten verlaten hebben
2558582 die is hier tussen vier en vijf uur aangekomen en heeft die mensen rustig benaderd
2558583 bij het zien van de politie is de grootste groep van de achterblijvers er ook vandoor gegaan maar een tiental is in de stellingen geklommen de agenten zijn hen achterna geklommen en hebben hen duidelijk gemaakt dat als ze niet vertrokken ze zouden opgepakt worden wie geen identiteitsdocumenten bijhad liep dan natuurlijk het risico in een gesloten instelling terecht te komen
2558584 ik heb met die mensen afgesproken dat we over veertien dagen opnieuw zouden samenzitten om te bekijken welke acties eventueel te overwegen zijn
2558585 ik blijf de asielzoekers steunen en wil ook voor deze groep mensen iets doen maar zoals het de laatste drie dagen liep kon echt niet

2558597 the 12 000 plus that are slated to attend the fight in lesnar s present hometown will definitely be pro brock which can t hurt a thing as it relates to lesnar s chances of not going 0 2 in the ufc lesnar can easily morph into a beast and a rah rah college like atmosphere may facilitate that transformation which some might consider to be costly for brock if he takes any unnecessary chances or tries to accomplish too much too fast being a lesnar fan i have plenty of concerns regarding this fight but i do think he will win and demonstrate how much his technique has improved since his debut it s really hard to see this fight going to the judges

2558644 the way homes shopping centers and other developments are built around puget sound could dramatically change to help reduce damage from polluted stormwater under a new ruling that rejects existing state stormwater rules the state pollution control hearings board which acts as a court to review challenges to state environmental regulations said today the state department of ecology had not gone far enough in mandating new techniques to control stormwater
2558645 the hearings board ordered ecology to require the biggest cities and counties in western washington including seattle tacoma and king pierce and snohomish counties to mandate much wider use of methods that get rainwater to soak into the ground
2558646 environmentalists argued the new methods which include narrower streets gardens designed to soak up rain and homes built on columns that leave topsoil undisturbed are well tested and usually reduce environmental damage
2558647 20 years from now these will be the same assholes arguing to ban building houses on stilts etc to fix the unintended consequences of their actions architects and engineers say we should build things the way we do for a good reason then along come the know it all watermelons with their feelings and the scientific knowledge of a 2nd grader to fuck it up

2558708 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2558709 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2558710 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2558711 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2558712 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2558713 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2558714 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2558715 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2558716 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2558717 all the things wed done so well in the last 18 months we forgot
2558718 hes got big boots to fill but hes certainly started the right way
2558719 hes so calm and hes got such a good head and hes pretty streetwise for his age
2558720 theres still a lot of cricket to play but we are in a good position
2558721 we are still ahead and they are two wickets down it will be important to come back early tomorrow and put them under pressure
2558722 attention to difficulty has increased too much id like for gymnastics to remain artistic
2558723 apparently he was just holding the ring badly and we are just praying that he is okay because we really need him for the team final
2558724 i havent seen him yet but others are saying he seems okay
2558725 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2558726 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2558727 russia sent hundreds of tanks and troops into the separatist province of south ossetia and bombed georgian towns saturday in a major escalation of the conflict that has left scores of civilians dead and wounded
2558728 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2558729 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2558730 i was excited when i saw our blue flag being waved in the stadium
2558731 even though we are in anarchy for a few hours yesterday we were no different than developed countries like the united states spain germany or canada
2558732 it reminded me of our heyday before the civil war
2558733 we were watching the opening carnival with great interest but we switched it off when we heard the gunfire
2558734 the main stadium there is now a military base so we trained on the highways and at the smaller banadir stadium
2558735 sometimes the violence stopped us from attending training but we are determined to do well
2558736 its the best name we could get because of its speed and power
2558737 many here are poor and cannot afford to install a satellite dish to watch the olympics
2558738 our main priority is to see the somali flag being hosted here
2558739 we have a young team and although we hope they will do well our desire is to see our flag among the other countries participating in the olympics
2558740 the response has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2558741 we are calling for an immediate cease fire and a stand down of all troops

2558746 nuestro saludo a la madurez pol tica del presidente evo morales para encarar los desaf os de la democracia al llamar a referendum revocatorio de su mandato y el de otras autoridades asimismo por la forma como ha tenido que sortear los obst culos para que el mismo se haga efectivo ser el pueblo el que deba tomar la mejor decisi n sobre su destino
2558747 nuestra solidaridad con el pueblo boliviano ante los embates de los sectores tradicionales de poder nacionales y extranjeros cuyas pretensiones han sido desestabilizar el gobierno del primer presidente ind gena del continente que con sobriedad y altura moral defiende los principios fundamentales de la democracia

2558751 we had the property built for our retirement it is only a year old and we had a hand in deciding the layout
2558752 we are particularly interested in gardening and the property now has quite beautiful landscaping
2558753 a main feature of the property is that four of the bedrooms have en suites the fifth bedroom that is currently being used as a study also has access to an en suite
2558754 the property would suit those with a family but we love it because we do a lot of entertaining with our family from the south coming to stay with us
2558755 we do prefer quite plain interiors so theres no question about it theres ample scope for buyers to have it decorated in a style that is suitable for them we have done nothing that is irrevocable
2558756 darras hall is a lovely rural setting and this property in particular backs on to a conservation area meaning that it can never be overlooked
2558757 we are going to be quite upset to leave its going to be a real wrench to leave this property behind
2558758 la verdad me siento muy bien el tobillo est mejor de que yo cre a as que estoy muy contento con eso

2558760 its not every day you can say you topped the charts at the cup level were really pleased with that we had a good test last week we felt we had something for them thats pretty cool running for the wood brothers the air force motorcraft and little debbie who are supporting this program its a real privilege to drive for the wood brothers and i just hope i can play my part in getting them back on track
2558761 yeah i said to the guys right now to forget about lap times make it comfortable because im going to have to be aggressive to drive past some cars and we might not have the fastest piece tomorrow because were going to set it up to be more comfortable so i can race it well were going to have to be smart out there i want to finish the race for them and get them some momentum
2558762 well im not very patient anyway so were in trouble

2558764 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2558765 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2558766 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2558767 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2558768 it was really good for our big red dodge weve found a lot of things on the car that we could improve on and think that we understand the car a little better coming into this weekend at watkins glen we still need to find some things to be really really good but i think that we have one of the fastest cars out here
2558769 our jim beam dodge is really fast were still a little too loose but i think we have a great handle on the adjustments to make our car even better the guys did a great job preparing our jim beam dodge and weve been good since we unloaded this morning i think that we can have a good day tomorrow
2558770 you have to have some luck running in the back is tough im going to have to pick my spots on where to pass and not put my car in a position where i can wreck it or run it off the road the key for us will be to put ourselves up near the front to be in position to make a run that last 20 lap dash

2558772 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2558773 ironically now its john edwards whos the one making allegations
2558774 without offering any more proof than his word and hes shown how much we can all trust that
2558775 alas abc didnt ask the right follow up questions such as how edwards thought meeting hunter in a hotel room would help keep the story quiet
2558776 if someone wearing one of our tethers strays beyond the geographic limitations programmed into it it immediately sounds an alarm and we are notified
2558777 same thing happens if someone would try to cut it off

2558788 violaciones de los acuerdos anteriores de paz y alto el fuego
2558789 las acciones de las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur son por supuesto un crimen y ante todo un crimen contra su propio pueblo

2558792 the biggest thing about racing at a road course is being smooth as a driver and being considerate of the other drivers around you there are some key points at watkins glen too turn 1 has some rumbles in it you can wheel hop pretty easily getting into turn 1 the esses turns 2 4 are all about finesse going up the hill and the fastest part of the race track is going into the bus stop turns 5 8 where you have to brake really hard you try to carry as much speed over there and not over brake you can gain and lose so much time in braking the bus stop also called the inner loop and carousel turn 9 are all smooth and finesse for 90 degree turns you have to get them right
2558793 i would have to say that this is probably the most challenging racetrack we go to because of the speed that you have to carry through some pretty tight corners the backstretch is long and you can really get into the gas though there but then you have to be careful as you head into the inner loop turns 5 8 also called the bus stop staying on the track and conserving brakes are probably the two most important factors at the glen
2558794 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice
2558795 we got guarantees that the parliament the democratic institutions the political parties and freedom will continue to exist
2558796 we will not release the deposed president at the time being for security reasons we are now trying to make calm prevail
2558797 as a political party every information we are privy to especially if we did not put any cost to it we are happy to take it and work with it
2558798 for a country that has been in power for nearly eight years considering what has happened in the world in the last 12 months with crude oil prices hitting nearly 150 per barrel to be still in a statistical dead heat with an opposition that says it will win the election then it tells you we are still on track
2558799 if they have enough funds they have to channel them into their core function of educating people on their civic responsibility
2558800 if polls were anything to go by kwabena agyapong would have been the presidential candidate
2558801 it is good to lament and complain but the way and manner it is done is the problem some are out there bastardising and criminalising the ec others are playing the tribal cards and saying it is the ec who is behind them
2558802 there are opportunities for people with ulterior motives to influence every step of the voting process which in the final analysis would affect the final results

2558838 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
2558839 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
2558840 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
2558841 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
2558842 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
2558843 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
2558844 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
2558845 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
2558846 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
2558847 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
2558848 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
2558849 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
2558850 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
2558851 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
2558852 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
2558853 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

2558902 between us men it is not the case that the one encounters god in the other it may well be that we mutually attest god and therefore the fact that we are compared with him and shamed by him it may well be that we can and must lead one another to shame before him but none of us is confronted with god himself or shamed by him in the existence of another man this takes place only but genuinely in the existence of the true man in jesus the son of god it is in relation to him and we all stand in relation to him that there is the comparison with a man which is also our comparison with the holy god and in this comparison with his of our actions and achievements our possibilities and actualizations the true expression of that which is within us and the inwardness of that which we express our whole whence and whither the root and crown of our existence we are genuinely shamed we are shamed because our own human essence meets us in him in a form in which it completely surpasses and transcends the form which we give it in him we are not encountered by an angel or a being which is superior and alien to our own nature so that it is easy to excuse ourselves if we fail to measure up to it we are confronted by a man like ourselves with whom we are quite comparable but we are confronted by a man in the clear exaltation of our nature to its truth in the fulfillment of its determination in the correspondence to the election and creation of man we are confronted by the man who is with and for god as god is with him at peace with god and therefore with his fellows and himself but this means that we are all asked by him who and what we ought to be as his brothers what about human life as we live it what about our thinking and willing and speaking and acting what about our heart and actions what about the use we make of our existence of the time which is given us of our own distinctive opportunity both as a whole and in detail what about our coming and going what about our motives and restraints our plans and attainments what about the ordering of our relationship to god and our neighbors and ourselves and finally and comprehensively what about our life act as gods good creatures within the cosmos of gods good creation if we had the freedom to orientate and measure ourselves by other men or by an abstraction that we regard as god or by a law invented and established by ourselves it might well be possible to acquit ourselves creditably or not too discreditably in face of these questions but we do not have this freedom we can only imagine that we have it the measure by which we are measured is the true man in whom the true god meets us concretely in a living encounter compared with him we stand there in all our corruption the failure of all that we have and do is revealed the lost state of our humanity is exposed our holiness however great or small drops away our brilliance is extinguished our boasting reduced to futility our pride deprived of its object the untruth in which we are men is disclosed the need in which god has accepted us in his son and which consists in the untruth of our humanity is incontestable this is our actual shaming whether we see it or not whether we are ashamed of ourselves or not we stand there as those who are shamed in this way in this shame because and as the man jesus is among us

2558928 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2558929 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

2558932 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2558933 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2558934 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2558935 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2558945 from a puritanical too much of it its too blatant it will encourage kids to be promiscuous etc

2558949 im going to address this post to the parents of skateboarders and kids who skate im 37 and i have two kids of my own when i was growing up in the mid late 80s i found skateboarding when it had its second resurgence
2558950 as long as we fail to provide legal relevant and worthwhile skate terrain for these kids they will use your stairways loading docks and park benches for their needs they arent going to stop skating you see its like asking a golfer to turn in his clubs i mean imagine if someone told you you couldnt golf on a course but could only golf in your back yard even worse if you live in a condo

2558958 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
2558959 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2558960 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2558961 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2558962 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2558963 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2558964 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2558965 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2558966 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization

2558981 according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000
2558982 using grenade launchers south ossetian local defense forces are destroying georgian tanks according to eyewitnesses they the tanks are on fire throughout the city
2558983 the islamic republic of iran is concerned about the current conflict in the south ossetia which claimed the lives of many defenseless civilians
2558984 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2558985 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2558986 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
2558987 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
2558988 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
2558989 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion

2558997 what amounts to an act of aggression against russian peacekeepers and the civilian population in south ossetia
2558998 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2558999 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2559000 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2559001 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2559002 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2559076 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons

2559078 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2559079 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2559080 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader

2559086 fair play to wexford but our lads will be gutted
2559087 at half time it was ok although it could have been a lot better we were wasteful in our shooting and some of our shot decision was wrong
2559088 we looked at their kickouts we looked at the shape of our team as we werent having the link men on the 40 that we wanted
2559089 we looked at getting the ball in sooner to our forwards and to be not forcing the shot
2559090 it was nip and tuck at half time everything was to play for
2559091 for a larte portion of the second half we were going but always just doing enough

2559203 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2559204 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2559208 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2559209 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2559210 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2559211 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2559212 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2559213 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2559214 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2559215 for anyone who enters gods rest also rests from his own work just as god did from his
2559216 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2559217 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2559218 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2559219 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2559220 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2559221 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2559222 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2559223 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2559224 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2559225 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2559226 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2559227 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2559228 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2559229 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2559230 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2559231 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2559232 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2559233 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2559234 who are open to doing something on the production side
2559235 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2559236 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2559237 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2559238 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2559239 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2559240 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2559241 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2559242 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2559243 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2559244 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2559245 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2559246 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2559247 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2559248 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2559249 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2559250 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2559251 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2559252 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2559253 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2559254 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2559255 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2559256 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2559257 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2559258 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2559259 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2559260 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2559261 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2559262 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2559263 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2559264 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2559265 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2559266 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2559268 iraqi premier gives one month ultimatum for displaced houses occupiers
2559269 lack of services financial support make life difficult for returnees
2559270 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2559271 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2559272 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2559273 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2559274 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2559275 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2559276 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2559277 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2559278 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2559279 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2559280 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2559281 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2559282 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2559283 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2559284 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2559285 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2559286 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2559287 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2559288 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2559289 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2559290 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2559291 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2559292 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie
2559293 he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2559294 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2559295 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2559296 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2559297 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2559298 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2559299 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2559300 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2559301 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2559302 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2559303 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2559304 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2559305 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity

2559309 that parents feel compelled to monitor their children on this scale should send a powerful message to the big social networking sites
2559310 with three quarters of a million underage users in the uk facebook myspace and bebo need to take their own age restriction policies far more seriously to help allay parents real fears
2559311 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon using sites such as facebook and bebo in the same way other generations used the telephone
2559312 with the summer holidays upon us and kids spending hours on the internet busy parents cant be expected to monitor their childrens activities all the time the recent proposals could go a long way to safeguarding children online but in the meantime what are facebook bebo myspace and the others doing to help
2559313 an official not doing something controversial is not news worthy
2559314 he was a warrior fighting for justice he was a sincere friend of chinese people

2559326 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
2559327 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
2559328 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2559329 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2559330 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2559331 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2559332 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
2559333 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
2559334 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2559335 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2559336 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2559337 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2559338 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2559339 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
2559340 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
2559341 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
2559342 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2559343 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2559344 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2559345 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2559346 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2559347 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2559348 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
2559349 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
2559350 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
2559351 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
2559352 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
2559353 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
2559354 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute
2559355 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2559356 if were trying to build a normal modern democratic european society there is no excuse for holding onto weapons and ive already started that debate
2559357 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2559358 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2559359 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2559360 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2559361 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
2559362 its not so good for sport or for gymnastics with judges making decisions not by result but according to some kind of game
2559363 im gonna get myself in a lot of trouble with his remarks
2559364 but its been like this forever it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends i dont know what message was sent to the judges in between sessions but i think were a better team
2559365 if you dont have an athlete here you cannot have a judge here
2559366 i know i dont look it but im 26 your body starts to tell you
2559367 eleven months ago i was given this challenge that seemed impossible and today i was out there competing in the olympic games representing canada and being a part of an incredible team
2559368 this is something i worked for for 20 years of my life and for these 11 months i had to search for small victories every single day you dont get that by winning a gold medal and i know that its not the final moment that defines the person its everything you have to go through to get there and for me the past 11 months especially have been so rich and taught me so much about myself and about the strength that i had and it felt phenomenal
2559369 its black and blue i told him dont be disappointed you contributed in ways you dont even know you pushed me made me push myself made everyone push themselves
2559370 it was very gutsy of him to go there and put it all on the line
2559371 im very proud of brandon he showed a lot of strength of character
2559372 brandon probably ruptured his lateral ligament complex and as well he had tendons that are snapping back and forth
2559373 he was probably an 8 or 9 on every landing
2559374 have this opportunity taken away from him when he had the potential for a podium position hes devastated
2559375 especially brandon pushing super hard to do anything he could just to get out there it was amazing to see him it was just insane i have no idea how he was able to pull it together

2559556 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples

2559575 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behaviour as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2559576 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2559577 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella

2559595 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2559596 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2559597 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2559598 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2559599 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2559600 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2559601 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2559602 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2559603 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2559604 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2559605 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2559606 perhaps the most troubling thing about the attack on expertise is that it increases the number of those who are satisfied with where they are

2559645 cheguei para ajudar meus companheiros vamos conseguir uma boa recupera o no campeonato
2559646 well frankly i had thought about it for years i never had the time to do it because of an extraordinarily busy practice of law that took me all over the world but after i had my stroke at age 73 i decided i wasnt going to be able to practice law any more because i couldnt read documents cant charge people for documents you cant read and i thought maybe now i will have time to write that book if i could only read the files and documents that i want to discuss in the book i was fortunate enough to encounter and retain a young princeton senior who said he was willing to be my researcher and colleague for that project
2559647 he was a wonderful boss he was easy to talk to full of compliments when i did something right but didnt get angry when i did something wrong and we found that our ideas and our ideals meshed he never asked me to write or do anything that was against my conscience
2559648 i can still see it in my minds eye we sat on the roof of his chicago hotel i was accompanied by my deputy mike feldman mike had with him a file of little 2 by 4 index cards on which he had jotted down every possible issue that might come up every question he even had kennedys previous statements on them what the democratic platform said on it what the republican platform said on it what nixon had said on it
2559649 oh yes they were included in that enormous batch as we sat there on the roof kennedy was getting his usual sun tan and whether i wanted a sun tan or not i was getting one too thats how we would later do it in the white house prepare for a press conference i would fire one question after another at him and if he felt comfortable that he knew that he would say fine on to the next he never rehearsed a speech and he never rehearsed a debate
2559650 with all due respect to my beloved friend arthur schlesinger whom i miss more all the time kennedys religion may have singled him out yes it certainly got a lot of attention but since most of the attention was negative in electoral terms it was not a net plus it was clearly a net minus he wouldve won by a much larger margin had he been a protestant obama today has only a narrow lead over mccain despite the fact that mccain is a member of the republican party that has seriously damaged our economy our standing in the world even the resilience of our military strength despite all that obamas lead even after his triumphant international tour is under 10 points i can assure you that if he were white his lead would be would be 30 points
2559651 first of all i think obama is counting on the american people to rise to that challenge because the american people are not going to fall for fake phony negative attacks on obamas patriotism look how he demonstrated what he is willing to do in the service of his country when it would be a lot easier for him just to you know rest on his laurels as an a student at harvard law school where he was head of the law review and then have a comfortable position as a partner at a big chicago law firm yet hes out there breaking his back risking his life putting himself on the line subjecting himself to the most scurrilous and nasty kinds of attacks from all the republican right from the swift boaters and even from mccain himself i would call that true devotion to the country on obamas part
2559652 when the sunday new york times magazine a few months ago in their famous q amp a column asked me that very question i immodestly replied ted sorensen age 103 servant of peace and justice
2559653 the single most important decision he will make as president is the most difficult and that is picking a team that team can make him or break him the president cant know everything he cant do everything so during that transition he has to find and attract to public service despite the slings and arrows that are directed toward people in public service these days its not easy you try to judge men and women by their reputations but some people are much better than their reputation and some are not even half as good as their reputation
2559654 i actually dont think race in itself is going to be a defining issue but race becomes another element in the fear mongering campaign that the mccain camp is running meaning hes not like us hes not like us because hes lived in hawaii which is barely america or he has a strange name or he doesnt look like the guys on the dollar bill as obama himself said so its not so much race as such but just the combination of somebody not your typical guy running for president and they are now using that in subliminal ways as well as directly and im sure thats going to intensify as we get closer to the election
2559655 well even back in 1988 mark the first bush campaign handed off the racial dirty work to other people and then denied that they had anything to do with it so even 20 years ago this was kind of a radioactive thing to do look i think obama is having a tremendously healthy effect on race relations generally the result in tennessee is a good example steve cohen didnt just win he trounced nicki tinker after she did those ads cohen being the incumbent white liberal and tinker his black challenger in a majority black district obama came in and denounced her and that was the end of that the black community there rejected that and re elected their white congressman and i think and hope that the reverse will be the same and that white voters and all voters will look at these candidates for the content of their character and the merit of their proposals
2559656 if one of the candidates decides to bring us down to that pathetic trivial level that the mccain campaign chose this week and last week and the media follow as we know inevitably they will then thats where the campaign goes thats really what happened in the last two weeks in fact when paris hilton responded thanks to adam mckay and his team that found her and taped this really funny ad it really showed how dreadful it was that john mccain of all people turned the american presidential campaign into a kind of reality show now of course paris hilton and britney spears if she wants to enter the fray has a legitimate reason to enter the fray at this particular moment honestly i really thought that because this is such a moment of crisis both internationally and domestically it would be much harder to trivialize this election but im being proven completely wrong it may be the opposite that the more serious the problems the more the media want to trivialize the election
2559657 staying above the fray will work very well until the debates come but at that point barack obama is going to have to wind up mccain as tight as he can and make him go off and that may decide the election
2559658 well the interesting thing is that this forgery was in fact created by someone because in december 2003 it was trumpeted on the front page of the conservative

2559666 i hope my coach will be here although i will not play with annika
2559667 on some holes you feel it more than others on the 18th they did the wave
2559668 i know how badly he wants to play that cant be much fun for mike because hes a gamer i feel bad for him
2559669 i dont know if it was an injury or heat
2559670 it was very difficult for the players to move on that quickly we only had three hours to deal with everything
2559671 the players called their parents we were supposed to have a technical meeting but we didnt do it i gave them time to speak to their families
2559672 it was difficult to deal with it was the first time in my life that i had to deal with something like that before a game

2559674 i spoke with his owner and we thought about giving turf a whirl
2559675 but he had a temperature that knocked him out a little he was all set for the haskell

2559680 music note is pretty consistent while little belle is not the best work filly
2559681 we certainly want to run one of the two fillies in the alabama we dont want to miss that race which looks to have a small field
2559682 without big brown the travers looks like it might have 12 horses and thats a consideration
2559683 if theres a plane in between now and then i may put him on that
2559684 he seems to have adjusted to the american method and style of training he didnt have to do a lot of training before his last race here he came in got out of quarantine on thursday trained friday and raced saturday and that was it so hes had to go out and train and come to a new place here and hes handled it all really well
2559685 were not exactly sure what happened to the filly but she was able to get up and walk back home
2559686 ever since last year hes had some little nagging soundness problems
2559687 and its always been up until three days before the race something you can sort of live with he wasnt quite 100 percent but it wasnt something that you couldnt run him
2559688 after he had a strong work on monday three days before the race he was definitely worse the next day
2559689 his right front leg had an inflamed area we called in the vet and he said we better scan it the horse had a small tear in the top of suspensory and they recommended four to six months off
2559690 ive been training horses on the oklahoma track forever because thats my track of preference and ive never seen a horse work as good as he did but hes a hell of a horse
2559691 he won the maryland sprint championship and then he came back and injured his foot in his last start and he didnt really fire he quarter cracked his foot very badly and we have not had him right until today and if he cools out of this okay today he will be in a race next week either a stakes or an allowance

2559769 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2559772 directories are a great way of acquiring one way backlinks to your site however tracking each of the hundreds of directories you have already used finding new free directories and actually submitting your sites to each directory is a tedious time consuming and boring process several webmasters have resorted to hiring firms that specialize in directory submission but can they be trusted do you really believe they are submitting your site to 5000 directories for 5 how do you know they are placing your site in the best category are you certain they arent submitting your sites to the same directories as the last firm dirzap solves all these problems for you by putting you back in control of your sites placement in the webs top directories
2559773 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2559774 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2559775 they will make the sleeves that can not contain my books they must be smaller than the actual size
2559776 excellent work if i were young i would propose you
2559777 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2559783 it demonstrates at the very least that you cannot count on a military jury to throw the book at people

2559785 they understand chain of command and the relative roles of people and this guy was a nobody
2559786 it is really a question of how a military panel would view a four star generals driver he was a driver this is a decision consistent with their military training and understanding
2559787 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months

2559800 i remember the wizards coming and the pretty tents in the meadow
2559801 they were shouting because no one was listening twenty one wizards came for the castle raising each had their own idea about what we needed so they each constructed their fragment of the castle structure according to their whims
2559802 i dont think its funny the chunks of castle were erected juxtaposed with the others but not as a whole unit i thank wulder that at least my parents had some sense my mother and father connected the tads bits and smidgens together with steps and short halls when nothing else would work they formed gateways from one portion to another
2559803 as long as i have known you youve appeared to be the same age are you ever going to grow up

2559807 you have hundreds of minor dragons in the castle and more big dragons in the fields
2559808 im a dragon keeper i know when any of my dragons have missed a meal or two
2559809 i think we should take a dozen guards with us
2559810 i dont think theres anything scary down here toopka after all as you reminded me this is our castle and we certainly havent invited anything nasty to live with us

2559842 we definitely didnt start off the way we wanted to but everything is not going to go your way and things are going to happen and its how you respond we came out of the timeout and responded immediately didnt waste any time at all at this stage of the game i think we have 10 days in together those kinds of things really please the coach to see that theyre still responsive theyre making adjustments on the fly
2559843 czech republic came out really strong and kind of dictated both sides of the ball
2559844 when they do that theyre a very tough team coach donovan called timeout kinda refocused on what we need to do and i think we did a good job of responding and coming back holding strong in that first quarter then building from there i think if anything the strength of today was how deep we are bringing people off the bench contributing changing the game the pace of it we just have to build from this just one game but good feelings from this game
2559845 weve been working on our defense and obviously 27 turnovers kind of reflected that that we forced
2559846 i feel really good about the things that were doing feel great about the bench and the depth that we have i just look forward to getting better hopefully every night out

2559935 my favorite part was hosting a lane with all women bowlers and having them beat up on the phillies players it wasnt even close way to go ladies
2559936 my lane was reserved for citizens bank i had a young girl in my lane named renata i was able to introduce her to cole hamels kyle kendrick and she even got to hug jimmy rollins she was so excited that she kept thanking me for helping her meet everyone it was awesome
2559937 cole hamels and kyle kendrick bowl really fast it was kind of funny to watch them throw underhand it was also a little scary because i thought that they were going to hurt their pitching arms
2559938 there was a family i bowled with later on in the event and they had three boys under age 10 when i asked them if they got any signatures or anything like that the expressions on their faces were priceless they were so proud to show me their autographed basebowl jerseys and baseballs that they got signed
2559939 my favorite moment of the jroll bowling event was watching the kids at the event meet all the professional athletes that were there all the players and celebrities were great with the kids they gave out their autograph took pictures and talked to them it was really nice to see the celebrities paying so much attention to the kids i also enjoyed watching eric bruntlett bowl because he was really good and fun to watch
2559940 the best part of the jroll bowling event was interacting with the participants the lane i was taking care of was a lot of fun and very social eventually it got to the point where the people in the lane just wanted to chat with each other instead of continuing to bowl so i became the designated bowler for at least 4 people in the lane though my bowling skills or lack thereof did not help my lane win the tournament my lane appreciated the help and we definitely had a great time
2559941 it was great to see the players coming to the moyer event on their day off especially after having just attended jrolls event it shows a lot about what our guys are made of when they arent playing ball this was more than just a public appearance as they were required to wait tables not only did they mingle with the fans sign autographs and pour wine but it was not unusual to see them take a seat at the table and engage in conversation with the guests one moment which was particularly heart warming was when adam eaton donated 10 000 to camp erin it was also pretty cool to see who else in addition to current phillies was willing to donate their time to a good cause

2559944 how do you follow a debut record that achieved out of the blue grandeur on its way to selling a quarter of a million copies for maines ray lamontagne its all about shaking up the formula evading repetition and delivering the unexpected till the sun turns black finds the introspective singer songwriter complementing his folk country ways with traces of strings and horns and spooky soulful background voices
2559945 making the decision to have a child its momentous it is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body
2559946 hey if you cant be the best hitter around well make you the best fielder around
2559947 things can get a little boring out there on a desert island and jimmy has quite a way of keeping things interesting he is always joking around and is quite charismatic plus he has his own record company so he can keep me entertained with his rap game
2559948 jimmy is always staying positive an outgoing team leader even if his baseball skills fade lets hope they dont he will still be right up there the heart of the team
2559949 chase is never in a long slump always stays positive has a good arm a good bat what more can i say
2559950 i love the belly circle it gets me every time seriously i cant help myself when the phanatic circles his belly i just crack up
2559951 have to give it to him the prank he pulled on kyle was classic
2559952 chase utley because it seems that he improves every season especially his defense and he is extremely consistent at the plate
2559953 the definition of congeniality is the capability to get along well with anyone its obvious that jamie has this quality simply because of his years of service in major league baseball on top of that he is the first and last player to sign autographs down at the park every single day he makes sure everyone gets one it just shows that he really understands that the game is just as much about the fans as it is the players
2559954 i would have said cole but he showed up to an interview wearing a turtleneck sweater that was pretty bad jimmy is always looking his best
2559955 next time youre at a game check out sos headshot his smile is infectious
2559956 hes got one of those smiles that when he smiles you smile and you dont even realize youre doing it
2559957 whether he is at bat or on the field you know something good is going to happen
2559958 he gives up his body on defense and has an arm like a cannon
2559959 ryan howards swing is pretty incredible but what i admire about chase is how short his swing is he generates so much power from such a short path that is the ultimate goal for any hitter
2559960 a playmaker to me is someone who can change the momentum of the game in one play or one swing of the bat so my vote goes to jimmy rollins its apparent that he can set the tone for the whole team
2559961 hands down pat gets my vote i dont know if it has to do with the fact that his contract expires this year but pat looks like a new player not only is he crushing the ball at the plate he is making some stellar plays in the outfield who would have thought people would be mentioning his name and whispering the words mvp after it

2559989 we looked at their kickouts we looked at the shape of our team as we werent having the link men on the 40 that we wanted
2559990 we looked at getting the ball in sooner to our forwards and to be not forcing the shot
2559991 it was nip and tuck at half time everything was to play for
