330062 acid reflux occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach pass up into the esophagus and the sphincter muscle the barrier between the two has a defect so it cannot block the acid
330063 the lining of the esophagus is not made to resist acid its very different from the stomach so acid reflux can cause ulcers and inflammation and a whole host of other problems
330064 there are certain lifestyle things we tell people to avoid
330065 alcohol consumption increases the risk of acid reflux as well as caffeine so do foods like chocolates and tomatoes or tomato based products if you have mild symptoms and can avoid these things you might be able to avoid medicines
330066 the thing that should be taken away is that acid reflux isnt going to kill you
330067 why we actually look down your throat into your esophagus with a scope is because it can cause other problematic conditions

330098 then i hit my first tee shot on 10 and walking off the tee my neck locked up
330099 the player field for this event is flat out amazing
330100 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
330101 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
330102 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
330103 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
330104 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
330105 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
330106 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
330107 im just going to be manny and play the game
330108 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
330109 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
330110 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
330111 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
330112 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
330113 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
330114 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
330115 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
330116 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
330117 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
330118 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
330119 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
330120 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
330121 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
330122 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
330123 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him
330124 this is utterly uncorroborated and at this point there is no reason to believe that al zawahiri has been injured or killed
330125 we are looking into the reports and will comment only after we have solid evidence either way
330126 i had a lot of confidence in all my pitches
330127 with the humidity here i felt like i could throw all of my breaking pitches for strikes

330129 act as a neutral utility serving all of public media it will also continue to operate as a fee for services business
330130 to be honest i havent really thought about that at all
330131 im just playing every game on its merits and just keep playing consistent football and if that comes it comes
330132 it doesnt really come into my head if im kicking goals and points are still there and were winning ive got no problem with it
330133 were pleased with the contribution he makes for our footy club
330134 theres a lot of people out there that seem to be displeased with it but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
330135 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guy that can get the footy and then focus on the goal kicking
330136 the way that we look at it he is a very very dangerous forward and what its doing is opposition sides are starting to double team him and thats going to create opportunities for other forwards in the side
330137 i hit a few fairways a few greens and holed a few putts
330138 i holed a few putts and got to three under and tried not to kill any spectators on the next nine when i was hacking out of trees i managed to miss most people i think i only hit a couple
330139 i made a couple of bogeys and got up and down a hell of a lot and managed to scrape one under which left me in pretty good position today i played pretty good
330140 it was a bit degrading playing the first nine holes the way i did
330141 when youre five over its pretty ugly i didnt have my ball position right and wasnt making a very good downswing
330142 failure to report 26 935 in political donations and failure to explain 18 277 paid to her by her political committee
330143 wilkerson had paid herself more than 28 000 from her campaign finance account in a dozen separate reimbursements that year all in round number amounts ranging from 1 000 to 5 000
330144 i consider the matter now closed my committee has worked to install several new practices and policies to ensure that these types of accounting errors will not be repeated
330145 yeah do they have to theyre selling more making more money selling more units good problem to have
330146 the outlook for singapore residential prices will probably be very flat
330147 the mass market take up rate is still very good and for the mid range tier the prices are holding out well but people will not be buying aggressively for the high end sector now
330148 if you observe the high end buyers they are not buying for investment purposes but as a second or third property in asia
330149 for the high end property the prices will still hover around 3 000 per square foot
330150 we have done well for this period the profits booked so far have surpassed the 750 million for the full year of 2006
330151 though celcom is also well known amongst local youth the celcom brand is targeted towards working adults who are more malay skewed and we have launched the celcom 1 3 plan and the celcom executive plan to accommodate that segment
330152 xpax is all about lifestyle for youths we want to offer reliable and powerful connectivity to maintain fast paced lifestyles it is a promise to keep you connected and provide service of the highest quality
330153 we are also associating the brand with a big music programme that is exclusive to the locals in sarawak
330154 we hope to continue our sponsorship with the festival as the response was good and the investment was well worth it
330155 since our involvement in the music scene the feedback has been tremendous when we brought in my chemical romance the response was overwhelming
330156 we recognise the importance of arts and entertainment for the youths and we will continue our support for local bands anugerah industry muzik aim and even local movies we also work closely with local acts like estrella and hujan
330157 as our target market becomes more and more jaded with pop music like britney spears and kelly clarkson we believe the underground music scene is coming up retro world music and even nasyid is making a comeback
330158 though xpax is more than two years old were going to move it to the next level this year onwards we have already identified different segments and as of end march 2008 xpax has a total of 5 9 million subscribers nationwide

330162 julia made a nice half smile slash grimace to acknowledge the comment
330163 unlike in the past for the first time this year weve had 1 600 platform meetings in the 50 states
330164 there is no silver bullet in health care it is going to require that everyone individuals employers insurers health care providers and government step up to the plate and try to figure out how we can get this solution done
330165 now despite the good news of this consensus the bad news is that the current president and his chosen successor do not share this vision what we are seeing from senator mccain is a plan that would take away the choice of employer based coverage putting millions of people at risk of trying to find coverage in the individual market where you can be denied coverage
330166 we urge the platform committee to call for greater federal oversight of private pensions and strongly affirm commitment to social security this includes rejecting the misguided calls by president bush and senator mccain to privatize social security throwing social security funds on the roulette wheel of the stock market is a gamble that americans just cant afford to take retirees were greatly offended to hear senator john mccain just a couple of weeks ago comment that social security is a disgrace
330167 42 million americans receive social security benefits these are our nations elderly our widows and our widowers people with disabilities and our young children who have seen a parent die this is not a disgrace senator mccain
330168 as arab americans we have felt the affect of these policies very acutely as a community that maintains close ties to the middle east where america was one revered we are now stung by anti american anger and the disgrace brought to our nation by the inexplicable abu ghraib or guantanamo bay or rendition or torture we speak to people against torture and do it ourselves
330169 this election provides more than a choice between two candidates what we will decide is whether or not to profoundly change direction reclaim our values and restore our image in the world form the incredible excitement that he generated in the primaries to his enthusiastic reception he received during his nine nation overseas tour we believe that the election of barack obama will send a much needed message to the world that america is back
330170 women in america cant afford another four years of a president who opposes affordable access to health care including family planning unfortunately john mccains 25 year record in congress has earned him a zero percent voting record on womens health issues with planned parenthood
330171 senator barack obama has spoken at length of the special nature and importance of americas ties with israel i want to emphasize because republicans would have the american people believe otherwise that senator obama has built an impeccable legislative record with support for the u s israel relationship moreover he has reiterated in great detail the importance of this relationship during this campaign and in his recent trip to the middle east

330192 i just found out today that adoptions from vietnam will open up to the states again soon perhaps a week or so i am soooo thrilled about this for one there are two kids at the orphanage that are already matched with american families but have been sitting idly by waiting for adoptions to open again both the kids are maybe 4 years old and i have been worried about them they are the sweetest things but dont speak english or vietnamese arent toilet trained and need to get out of the orphanage so they can develop normally with individual attention the other reason i am so happy is because as most of you know i have always planned to adopt a child from vietnam and this just means its not an indefinite wait for me to do it maybe if im lucky ill get started on it when i get home home no one freak out it still will take a minimum of 18 months or so at least this news has put a smile on my face
330193 the president expressed his commitment to continue the development of intercountry adoption cooperation between the united states and vietnam that ensures the best interests of the child respects his or her fundamental rights and prevents the abduction and trafficking of children the prime minister underscored that vietnam shares the goals and stressed that vietnam will speed up preparations for an early accession to the hague convention on intercountry adoptions the prime minister also welcomes u s technical assistance in facilitating this step

330213 everything seems to fit and i mean that literally we talked about it and considered that at one end of the spectrum jesus might have had very very tiny feet like small earphones on the other hand he might have had massive feet like yachts the safest bet is to say he had medium sized feet that way youre closest to most eventualities the sock handed in is just that medium sized
330214 its clearly of middle eastern origin thats plain and id certainly place it before claudius adidas edict of 43ad this was a golden age for socks

330224 he was off the blocks and going for gold even before gordon brown had put his trousers on incredible
330225 ive seen him coax a baboon out of a sycamore with just one bunch tony blair should be worried
330226 he knows his pandas from his porcupines but politically hes a fish out of water
330227 id be very surprised if this article is taken seriously
330228 hes got a very hands on approach to things hes always got his hands on something whether its a baby penguin or a passing choirboy his hands will be on it on it like a whippet amazing yes sometimes hes been arrested but havent we all i know i have christ loads of times
330229 im sure hed have been really quite interested he always enjoyed his current affairs its a pity in many ways
330230 it is clear to me that some sort of mistake has been made said tory mp toff snobham from the constituency of titcombe mallard north
330231 the ballot paper only had one name on it and that name was michael howard
330232 i didnt notice any other name present unless it was the one that said battery powered pigeon but that was a joke that was obviously a joke i mean i ticked the box next to it but it was a laugh wasnt it
330233 it just flaps from one end of the room to the other
330234 back and forth back and forth and its eyes light up in the dark what sort of a pigeon does that
330235 if you get bored of watching it go back and forth back and forth you can clap your hands and it goes eeeeeeeee
330236 i always liked mr macmillan he was ever such a nice man we used to buy all our turnips from him and hed always let me tickle his dog is the war still on
330237 the pigeon has set out some interesting policies so far not all to do with feathers and we intend to use them to hold this discredited government to account once theyve stopped laughing
330238 they last for ages weve had the same one in our telly remote for seven years
330239 all my family were really interested in the owls but after a while i wasnt at all i looked at them for a bit but then just wanted to sit down and read the paper
330240 unfortunately my children kept coming up to me pulling at my arm and saying look daddy look at the owls i tried to explain that id already seen them but they didnt understand
330241 we were watching television it was wildlife on one and it was about owls
330242 i watched it for a while about twenty five minutes maybe half an hour then decided id go and see if my plant was all right but my wife called out from across the room jiff look at the owls theyre swooping over a river to catch fish so i had to put down my watering can and go and see the owls again even though id already been watching them earlier i just really wanted to ignore them thats when i got the idea
330243 you certainly cant see owls thats working perfectly but its still possible to hear them faintly i need to work on a way of wrapping the visor in more duvet
330244 the danger i believe there to be is that owls are important creatures that need to be looked at their image is important particularly to the christmas card industry if everybody wore mr smithings owl ignoring device owls would lose an important part of their income theyd end up having to take on a variety of jobs many of which may be unsuitable
330245 but every so often id just rather not see them when im having a dump for example and dont want to be put off so i would cautiously welcome any kind of ignoring device providing of course that it caused no distress to the owls i wouldnt want that

330251 the big push and economic development in the american south
330252 publicly coordinated investment can break the underdevelopment trap by helping economies overcome deficiencies in private incentives that prevent firms from adopting modern production techniques and achieving scale economies
330253 the unemployment rate is giving you a misleading impression of some of the adjustments that are taking place
330254 hours cut is a big deal people still have a job but they are losing income
330255 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
330256 first you see hours get short and eventually more people will get laid off
330257 companies today would rather not go through the process of dumping someone and hiring them back
330258 firms are going to short shifts rather than just laying people off
330259 its not governments job to bail out those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could not afford
330260 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

330265 milton friedmans monetarism considered revolutionary when first proposed in the sixties is now common wisdom
330266 not all oil price shocks are alike disentangling demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market
330267 why does gasoline cost so much a joint model of the global crude oil market and the us retail gasoline market he writes
330268 you might increase the overall efficiency of the health care system
330269 mainly due to the extensive bureaucracy required to assess risk rate premiums design benefit packages and review pay or refuse claims
330270 must hire office personnel just to deal with the insurance companies
330271 a well run office can get the insurers rejection rate down from 30 percent to say 15 percent thats how a doctor makes money its a war with insurance every step of the way
330272 ignored solows landmark finding 1956 that productivity gains explain above 80 of us economic growth
330273 rapidly falling transportation and communication costs are perhaps more important features of the globalisation story than policy liberalization
330274 another quasi governmental agency thats lending hundreds of billions to troubled banks
330275 federal home loan bank debt is not guaranteed by nor is it the obligation of the u s government
330276 i got emails from people saying they thought i was right

330300 the next sunspot cycle will be 30 to 50 stronger than the previous one
330301 first remember what sunspots are tangled knots of magnetism generated by the suns inner dynamo a typical sunspot exists for just a few weeks then it decays leaving behind a corpse of weak magnetic fields
330302 the top of the conveyor belt skims the surface of the sun sweeping up the magnetic fields of old dead sunspots the corpses are dragged down at the poles to a depth of 200 000 km where the suns magnetic dynamo can amplify them once the corpses magnetic knots are reincarnated amplified they become buoyant and float back to the surface
330303 it takes about 40 years for the belt to complete one loop
330304 anywhere from a 50 year pace slow to a 30 year pace fast
330305 old magnetic fields swept up then should re appear as big sunspots in 2010 2011
330306 history shows that big sunspot cycles ramp up faster than small ones
330307 i expect to see the first sunspots of the next cycle appear in late 2006 or 2007 and solar max to be underway by 2010 or 2011
330308 bear witness to the sickness of these dictators hope you understand the time brother cause its major

330311 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun

330313 fort detrick is one of the premier biodefense labs and if they have problems what does it mean for all the others
330314 the bad news is that nobody got the disease because just about everybody near the bl 3 suite had been vaccinated
330315 repeatedly expressed concern to ivins that she may have been exposed to anthrax spores when handling powder
330316 if this is from the daschle powder it could be re aerosolized and somebody could get hurt really bad if its from ordinary culture its not that dangerous
330317 im not convinced i know the source of the contamination
330318 the message here from a scientific and policy standpoint is profound
330319 facilities that are medical and microbiological may not be suitably equipped for dealing with aerosolized versions of the organisms that they otherwise deal with in great safety these facilities probably ought not be located in a heavily populated area how do you contain smoke
330320 the chance that theyll be working in the same rushed atmosphere they faced at fort detrick is very small
330321 any defense lawyer should read this report carefully and keep it in mind when dna results are being quoted against his or her client

330334 whether its midsummer or little house on the prairie our structure is such that we dont make money to put on a musical in a less than 700 seat house is not something that someone would do in a commercial venture were not sitting on a cash cow
330335 as a kid i read the books and then when my children were growing up we watched the tv show
330336 i think its obviously a huge thing for young girls who have read these books

330372 thats really the bigger purpose is to get the young people interested in aviation again and the aerospace industry

330404 sesungguhnya manusia yang paling buruk kedudukannya orang yang menghilangkan menghancurkan akhiratnya dengan dunia orang lain
330405 al lajnah li al buhuts al ilmiyyah wa al ifta
330406 apakah orang yang meyakini bahwa ada orang yang mampu mengatur alam semesta
330407 orang yang meyakini hal itu adalah kafir karena ia telah mempersekutukan allah dalam rububiyah seperti pengaturan alam semesta
330408 pendapat ini tak benar dalil yang membuktikan hal itu yakni kebatilan teori darwin allah taala telah menjelaskan dalam tentang periode penciptaan adam seraya berfirman
330409 dan sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia dari suatu saripati berasal dari tanah
330410 dan sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia adam dari tanah liat kering yang berasal dari lumpur hitam yang diberi bentuk
330411 dan sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia dari suatu saripati berasal dari tanah kemudian kami jadikan saripati itu air mani yang disimpan dalam tempat yang kokoh rahim kemudian air mani itu kami jadikan segumpal darah lalu segumpal darah itu kami jadikan segumpal daging dan segumpal daging itu kami jadikan tulang belulang lalu tulang belulang itu kami bungkus dengan daging kemudian kami jadikan dia makhluk yang berbentuk lain maka maha sucilah allah pencipta yang paling baik
330412 hai sekalian manusia bertakwalah kepada tuhan mu yang telah menciptakan kamu dari seorang diri dan dari padanya allah menciptakan isterinya dan dari pada keduanya allah memperkembang biakkan laki laki dan perempuan yang banyak dan bertakwalah kepada allah yang dengan mempergunakan nama nya kamu saling meminta satu sama lain dan peliharalah hubungan silaturrahim sesungguhnya allah selalu menjaga dan mengawasi kamu
330413 aku pernah mendapatkan dalam sebagian kitab kitab suatu ungkapan yang berbunyi
330414 ungkapan ini tak benar dari segi maknanya karena allah dialah sang maha pencipta segala sesuatu dan pemiliknya
330415 dan dia lah yang menjadikan kamu penguasa penguasa di bumi dan dia meninggikan sebahagian kamu atas sebahagian yang lain beberapa derajat untuk mengujimu tentang apa yang diberikan nya kepadamu sesungguhnya tuhanmu amat cepat siksaan nya dan sesungguhnya dia maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
330416 mudah mudahan allah membinasakan musuhmu dan menjadikan kamu khalifah di bumi nya maka allah akan melihat bagaimana perbuatanmu
330417 mengapa engkau hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat kerusakan padanya dan menumpahkan darah padahal kami senantiasa bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan mensucikan engkau
330418 saya diperintahkan sujud di atas tujuh anggota badan tidak menahan rambut dan tidak pula menahan pakaian
330419 para ulama telah sepakat tentang terlarangnya melakukan shalat sedang pakaian atau lengannya tersingsingkan
330420 jika demikian keadaan pakaiannya dan kondisinya sebelum melakukan shalat di mana dia sedang melakukan suatu perbuatan yang menyebabkan ia menyingsingkan pakaiannya kemudian dia melakukan shalat dalam keadaannya itu maka tidaklah mengapa dia shalat dalam kondisi demikian itu jika ia melakukannya semata mata untuk menahan rambut dan pakaian itu maka tidak ada kebaikan baginya
330421 lahiriahnya larangan itu bersifat muthlaq baik dia menyingsingkannya untuk shalat maupun sebelumnya telah menyingsingkannya lalu shalat dalam keadaan seperti itu
330422 larangan menyingsingkan pakaian adalah larangan makruh tanzih kalau dia shalat dalam keadaan seperti itu berarti dia telah memperburuk shalatnya meskipun shalatnya tetap sah dalam perkara itu abu jafar muhammad bin jarir ath thobariy berhujjah dengan ijma kesepakatan ulama sedangkan ibnul mundzir telah menyebutkan tentang pendapat wajibnya mengulangi shalat dari al hasan al basriy
330423 lalu madzhab jumhur menjelaskan bahwa larangan itu bersifat mutlak bagi orang yang shalat dalam keadaan seperti itu baik dia sengaja melakukannya untuk shalat atau karena ada maksud lain
330424 larangan itu dikhususkan bagi orang yang melakukan untuk shalat sedangkan pendapat yang shahih adalah pendapat yang pertama itulah lahiriah pendapat yang ternukil dari sahabat atau yang lainnya
330425 janganlah salah seorang di antara kalian shalat dengan satu pakaian sehingga tidak ada sedikitpun pakaian yang menutupi kedua bahunya
330426 orang yang shalat wajib meletakkan suatu pakaian di atas bahunya jika dia mampu menutupinya
330427 sesungguhnya shalat itu tidak memenuhi bagi siapa yang tidak menutupi kedua bahunya kebanyakan fuqaha berkata
330428 yang demikian itu tidak wajib dan bukan menjadi syarat sahnya shalat ini pendapat malik dan yang lainnya sebab keduanya bukan aurat maka anggota badan yang lain diserupakan dengannya
330429 larangan ini adalah untuk menyatakan makruh bukan larangan haram maka kalau seseorang shalat dengan satu pakaian yang telah menutupi auratnya meskipun tidak ada satu pun pakaian yang menutupi bahunya shalatnya tetap sah dan perbuatan itu dibenci makruh baik dia mampu menjadikan sesuatu sebagai penutup bahunya ataupun tidak
330430 demikianlah yang dikatakan oleh al kirmaniy dia telah lupa terhadap penjelasan yang baru disebutkan dari an nawawi tentang keterangan yang telah kami nukilkan dari ahmad sesungguhnya ibnul mundzir telah menukil dari muhammad bin ali tentang larangan tidak menutupinya ucapan at tirmidziy juga menunjukkan adanya khilaf perbedaan ath thahawiy membuatkan bab tentang hal ini dalam syarhul maaniy 1 377 dan menukil adanya larangan dalam perkara itu dari ibnu umar kemudian dari thawus dan selain ath thohawiy telah menukilkan dari ibnu wahb dan ibnu jarir syaikh taqiyuddin as subkiy telah menukil tentang wajibnya perkara itu dari teks ucapan dan dia telah memilihnya tetapi yang telah diketahui dalam kitab kitab bukan itu
330431 sungguh telah ternukil riwayat dari ahmad yang menunjukkan bahwa perkara tersebut tidak termasuk syarat shalat dan dia telah mengambil pendapat itu dari riwayat mutsanna dari ahmad tentang orang yang shalat memakai sirwal celana lebar dan pakaiannya menutupi salah satu dari kedua bahunya dan yang lainnya terbuka
330432 jika seseorang melekatkan tali atau yang sejenisnya pada bahunya apakah telah mencukupi
330433 yang benar yang demikian itu tidak mencukupinya karena nabi shollallahu alaihi wasallam bersabda
330434 apabila salah seorang dari kalian shalat dengan satu pakaian maka hendaklah dia menyilangkan di antara kedua tepinya di atas kedua bahunya
330435 dijadikan indah pada pandangan manusia kecintaan kepada apa apa yang diingini yaitu wanita wanita anak anak harta yang banyak dari jenis emas perak kuda pilihan binatang binatang ternak dan sawah ladang
330436 cara untuk mencari dan memilih pasangan hidup agar bisa saling mengenal karakter dan sifat masing masing sebelum menjalani bahtera kehidupan rumah tangga
330437 dan janganlah kamu mendekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu adalah suatu perbuatan yang keji dan suatu jalan yang buruk
330438 aku bertanya kepada rasulallahi shollallahu alaihi wasallam tentang pandangan yang tiba tiba tanpa sengaja
330439 telah ditulis bagi setiap bani adam bagiannya dari zina pasti dia akan melakukannya kedua mata zinanya adalah memandang kedua telinga zinanya adalah mendengar lidah lisan zinanya adalah berbicara tangan zinanya adalah memegang kaki zinanya adalah melangkah sementara qalbu berkeinginan dan berangan angan maka kemaluanlah yang membenarkan merealisasikan hal itu atau mendustakannya
330440 maka janganlah kamu tunduk bersuara lembut dalam berbicara sehingga berkeinginanlah orang yang ada penyakit dalam hatinya dan ucapkanlah perkataan yang baik
330441 maknanya hal ini seorang wanita berbicara di balik tirai dan penghalang pent dengan orang lain dengan ucapan yang di dalamnya tak terdapat kemerduan suara yakni seorang wanita tidak berbicara dengan orang lain sebagaimana ia berbicara dengan suaminya dengan penuh kelembutan
330442 jangan sekali sekali salah seorang di antara kalian kaum pria berduan dengan seorang wanita karena setan adalah pihak ketiganya
330443 andaikan kepala seseorang di cerca dengan jarum besi itu lebih baik ringan baginya dibandingkan menyentuh seorang wanita yang tak halal baginya
330444 dalam hadits ini terdapat ancaman yang keras bagi orang yang menyentuh wanita yang tak halal baginya jadi di dalamnya juga ada dalil yang menunjukkan
330445 ada tiga golongan yang sungguh allah haramkan baginya surga pecandu khomer orang yang durhaka kepada orang tuanya dan dayyuts yang membiarkan perbuatan keji dalam keluarganya
330446 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
330447 sugammadex represents the first major pharmaceutical innovation in the field of anesthesia in two decades we remain committed to bringing this important medical advance to those who are waiting for it in the united states and plan to work with the agency to address the issues which are primarily related to hypersensitivity allergic reactions
330448 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
330449 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
330450 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
330451 the figure of 16 million euros has been mentioned but i dont want to comment about that
330452 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
330453 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
330454 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy
330455 the economic factors that strained the demand for new vehicle sales in the us for the first half of 08 are still with us full force
330456 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
330457 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
330458 we are writing a new chapter in the auto industry story as customers dealers and companies adjust to a changing environment
330459 theres a lot of variation in the results that were getting
330460 it plays into the very hectic and uncertain market were in
330461 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
330462 toyota honda and nissan continue to benefit from a stronger cash position and a healthier balance sheet than gm ford or chrysler
330463 there are very few manufacturers that are really immune from a very difficult market
330464 we expect the convenience and readiness of the intravenous bags to significantly complement and build upon the market success of the cardene i v ampoules
330465 with the addition of the ready to use bags the breadth of our cardene product offerings has expanded greatly and we foresee opportunities for wider utilization of this anti hypertensive across a range of acute care settings
330466 this is a particularly exciting event for ekr because many of us were part of the original team at esp pharma that identified acquired and relaunched cardene i v ampoules on what has since proved to be a road of successful growth
330467 this has long been a criticism of the administration going back for a few years now that basically we treat countries differently depending on where they are on the political spectrum where they are in relation to the united states
330468 to the world its very very hard because its sends a mixed signal it says basically what can you do to earn the good graces of the united states
330469 nuclear family vacation travels in the world of atomic weaponry
330470 how we missed the story osama bin laden the taliban and the hijacking of afghanistan
330471 if the us government does not consider a place important we should actually look at it and render our own judgments as media we shouldnt be following their flag
330472 when the war developed internally and the taliban tried to take control of the entire country almost nobody in the american media and really most of the international media took any notice of it and it was in that internal conflict that osama bin ladin basically got his foothold and in a sense then hijacked the government
330473 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado
330474 vi que est n empobrecidos que sus tierras est n secas que detr s de las forestales hay todo un aparataje pol tico pol tico militar y vi que la industria forestal se gasta toda la plata que sea necesaria para acallar a cualquier persona que se rebele contra el sistema los allanamientos a las comunidades mapuches son constantes y terribles yo creo que algunos todav a buscan entre los mapuches a ese terrorista que imagin pinochet un terrorista que nunca van a encontrar en la zona mapuche porque no existe
330475 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
330476 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa
330477 los ni os enfermos de temucuicui comunidad mapuche de la zona de ercilla sometida a constantes allanamientos de las fuerzas especiales de carabineros se ve en sus dibujos en sus dibujos ellos pintan militares dentro de sus casas explosiones de bombas lacrim genas eso es lo que no quieren que se sepa y quieren saber adem s d nde est n los mapuches que est n luchando para exterminarlos como quieren hacer conmigo yo quise hacer una pel cula y me encarcelaron esta es una manera de exterminarme de silenciarme
330478 las autoridades la han detenido en un intento de frenar las investigaciones sobre este conflicto y de intimidar tanto a ella como al pueblo ind gena mapuche la polic a confisc en su casa art culos como cintas de v deo equipo de sonido c maras fotogr ficas y tel fonos m viles as como vestuario que se necesita para filmar el documental adem s se llev los materiales de la investigaci n que elena varela hab a realizado y documentos relacionados con la financiaci n de la pel cula por parte del fondo de fomento audiovisual del consejo nacional de la cultura y las artes amnist a internacional teme que esta informaci n pueda ser utilizada por las fuerzas de seguridad chilenas para intimidar y acosar a activistas mapuches y a quienes contribuyen con su opini n a la investigaci n
330479 dos periodistas franceses christopher cyril harrison y joffrey paul rossj fueron detenidos el 17 de marzo pasado en collipulli mientras filmaban a un werk n autoridad tradicional del pueblo mapuche la polic a requis los equipos de filmaci n as como las cintas que conten an el trabajo realizado hasta ese momento aunque hubo un intento de expulsi n el c nsul franc s evit que eso ocurriera dos d as despu s fueron agredidos en la calle junto al werk n por un grupo de doce personas algo similar ocurri el s bado 3 de mayo con giuseppe gabriele y dario ioseffi dos documentalistas italianos en momentos en que hac an un registro audiovisual de una movilizaci n mapuche en un predio de forestal mininco reivindicado hace casi dos d cadas por la comunidad chupilko
330480 preocupaci n por la situaci n de la libertad de expresi n en chile
330481 por no poder mostrar lo que ten a para mostrar pero tengo que ser fuerte porque el dolor de los mapuches lo estoy sufriendo ahora yo en carne propia
330482 documentalista de film mapuche y las graves violaciones al trabajo documental
330483 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
330484 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
330485 hay un intento del gobierno de satanizar a los secundarios
330486 vos jos ancalao te cagastes solo y donde te pillemos te vamos a liquidar
330487 insultar golpear y en ltimo caso humillar de la forma en la que se le hizo y no conformes con ello con el objetivo de eludir su responsabilidad en los acontecimientos se le acusa y se le imponen cargos sin fundamentos s lidos que son requerimiento esencial en este tipo de casos
330488 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n
330489 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente
330490 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
330491 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
330492 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
330493 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
330494 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
330495 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
330496 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
330497 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
330498 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
330499 emplazamos p blicamente a ambos consejeros a que si tienen algo que decir comentar o discutir las puertas de la comunidad siempre han estado abiertas al di logo y por lo tanto les invitamos p blicamente a visitarnos adem s necesitamos que cambien su actitud servil a los intereses del estado chileno y que le hacen un flaco favor a la lucha de nuestro pueblo mapuche
330500 mediante carta dirigida al coordinador residente del sistema de naciones unidas enrique ganuza y acompa ada con copia a diversas autoridades el observatorio ciudadano manifest su extra eza ante un acuerdo celebrado sin la debida consulta a los pueblos ind genas as como su preocupaci n por las implicancias que ste pueda tener en los derechos de estos pueblos en chile

330509 la demanda hist rica de la comunidad pewenche ha sido la veranada de cochico y el fundo trapa la cual les ha tra do por m s de 100 a os conflictos y enfrentamientos con los colonos e inquilinos entre los a os 1999 y 2003 las comunidades sostuvieron una serie de movilizaciones logrando expulsar a los colonos asentados en el territorio quienes fueron relocalizados por instrucci n de la gobernaci n provincial del bio bio
330510 podemos mencionar que en el a o 2001 el clima de movilizaci n y tomas de predios era generalizado en gran parte de las provincias del bio bio arauco malleco y caut n por su parte los comuneros de trapa trapa hab an ocupado parte del fundo del mismo nombre controlando el acceso y la veranada de cochico a partir de este momento se comienzan a suceder una serie de hechos no esclarecidos por la justicia chilena que dicen relaci n con muertes de pewenches acciones de amedrentamiento por parte de los colonos y carabineros y persecuci n judicial contra los dirigentes
330511 yo fui detenido el 20 de marzo de 2003 yo era presidente de la comunidad trapa trapa butalelbum elegido del 2001 al a o 2005 me acusaron los colonos de usurpaci n de tierras y robo con fuerza eso despues que entramos a recuperar el fundo cochico d as despu s fue detenido el lonko de butalelbun pe i roberto carlos manquepi estuvimos dos meses presos con el pe i y salimos bajo fianza el 2006 el juzgado de santa b rbara nos conden a 5 a os y un dia esta sentencia fue ratificada por la corte de apelaciones el mismo a o y finalmente con fecha 20 de enero de 2008 la corte suprema confirm esto
330512 los colonos pasaban a ser como due os ilegales los ruiz los castillo los acu a por eso decidimos entrar con nuestras familias pero apenas entramos ellos hicieron las denuncias por robo de animales por da os por usurpaci n de tierras f jese si la tierra habia sido de nuestros abuelos veranadas que ten amos y nos acusaban de estar usurpando no nos movilizamos solos tambien de malla malla de cau ic la gente comenz a moverse para recuperar su tierra es por esta raz n que me persiguen judicialmente
330513 entendemos concluyen en su escrito judicial que es aplicable la instituci n de refugio pol tico por cuanto el sr vivanco rebolledo debi salir de su pa s natal por estar en peligro su vida libertad e integridad corporal valores contemplados en la convenci n internacional sobre el estatuto de los refugiados
330514 est siendo perseguido y amenazado por las cuestiones pol ticas y sociales expresamente previstas en el instrumento internacional ya referido y particularmente por cuestiones tnicas
330515 desde esta c rcel le doy un aliento mis m s sinceros saludos y felicitarlo por la valent a de estar en clandestinidad y no dejarse entregar
330516 me encuentro recluido en esta c rcel por reivindicar nuestro derecho como naci n mapuche me han encarcelado injustamente este es el costo que tenemos por luchar por nuestro pueblo por qu de una vez el gobierno de chile no nos respeta como pueblo
330517 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
330518 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
330519 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
330520 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
330521 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
330522 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
330523 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
330524 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
330525 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
330526 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
330527 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
330528 todav a no se ha hecho la devoluci n pedida de las cintas y del respeto al derecho del secreto de las fuentes eso independiente que la ley no lo consigne porque esto no significa que no sea leg timo se ha pedido al ministerio de interior por medio de su subsecretario felipe harboe y a trav s de la ministra de cultura paulina urrutia pero la verdad estamos a la espera de una conferencia de prensa del ministerio de cultura la que todav a no se da
330529 ha sido la mayor preocupaci n de elena varela y de los organismos de derechos humanos en la medida que da cuenta de la situaci n y violaci n de derechos del pueblo mapuche ella ha filmado a alguno de esos pueblos incluso nosotros la hemos acompa ado
330530 es imprescindible un pronunciamiento formal y p blico de parte del gobierno de chile que incluya la defensa integral del trabajo period stico y documental
330531 as pues hay muchos recursos sin uso que no son transables que no reciben inversi n y que no generan trabajo
330532 si no lo hago yo que no lo haga nadie
330533 el primer recurso es la amazon a tiene 63 millones de hect reas y lluvia abundante en ella se puede hacer forestaci n maderera
330534 dicen tambi n que dar propiedad de grandes lotes dar a ganancia a grandes empresas claro pero tambi n crear a cientos de miles de empleos formales para peruanos que viven en las zonas m s pobres es el perro del hortelano
330535 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
330536 ley de promoci n de las inversiones en el sector agrario

330581 there are many climate myths but four which greatly irritate me are firstly the assertion that the science is settled when it clearly isnt secondly the claim that the warming that occurred during the last quarter of the last century was unprecedented when there are well documented warm periods in history thirdly the assumption that any adverse climatic phenomenon must be due to allegedly man made global warming and fourthly with the regular description of carbon dioxide emissions as pollution whereas in fact carbon dioxide so far from being a pollutant is like oxygen a life force

330606 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
330607 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
330608 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
330609 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
330610 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
330611 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
330612 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
330613 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
330614 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
330615 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
330616 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
330617 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
330618 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
330619 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
330620 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
330621 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
330622 demonstrate that the focus of the obama campaign has been as much to create that celebrity status of his as it is to discuss the hard issues that the american people are forced to debate during the course of this campaign
330623 what we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world
330624 and i would say from our estimations britney and paris came in second and third
330625 its backed up by the reality of his tour around the world he has many fans
330626 the question that we are posing to the american people is this is he ready to lead yet and the answer to the question that we will offer to the american people is no that he is not
330627 although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
330628 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another

330634 it might be false or misleading to call it a barbecue said olympic boss john coates beforehand
330635 we are not able to cook meat outside the dining room normally we can get them to cook it for us but this will be a barbecue with cold meats and salad
330636 the improved ease of use will help wiki adoption in our organization
330637 i cant see that it is very healthy or safe and you know we dont want to be heavy handed government but if the parents dont exercise the right the kind of control i guess were probably going to need to legislate this
330638 if you as a parent or a citizen make different choices than we would well make laws that criminalize your behavior
330639 i cant throw the bike into the corner like i want
330640 i cant change directions like i want i cant brake as hard as i want it sucks because the bike is working really great but i cant ride it as hard as i want to or need to
330641 the doctors told me it wasnt the best idea for me to go racing
330642 this project here at walton this flooring alone is about 350 000

330644 when you have upgraded schools you have better performing students and better performing professionals helping to build a better community

330649 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
330650 it is an additional option to allow us to keep kids in the educational classroom
330651 i dont think that jumpsuits are going to work because my friends actually instead of it being a punishment theyll see it as an opportunity to be like rebels
330652 i dont think theres going to be enough jumpsuits for everyone in the school
330653 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
330654 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
330655 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing
330656 they had a good meeting they agreed that the war on terror was one that we needed to fight together because the enemy is going not just after pakistanis but the united states as well and so our joint efforts need to be comprehensive
330657 we continue to work with the pakistanis to try to improve the situation
330658 the iraqi government calls upon all parties and factions to be calm wise and to resort to the constitution
330659 but if such violations carry on and then we start retaliatory action the ceasefire is over the defence ministers warning can be said to be in preparation for that
330660 a soldier in a track suit with a white flag in his hand was leading them and they were around 200 metres inside our territory when our patrol saw them we did not open fire because they were carrying that flag
330661 the way in which the attack in ahmedabad took place the multiplicity of the bombs and the way in which they were coordinated suggests a level of expertise not yet associated with any indian group
330662 it is reasonable to say this group has benefited from external involvement
330663 i think the effort of both sides will be to see that even if there is no breakthrough there is no break off
330664 both countries will aim to keep the dialogue process alive
330665 the level of trust that had been slowly built up over the past four years has been affected
330666 this in turn will affect the content of the dialogue process
330667 mutual legal aid treaty amongst all saarc countries launching a saarc development fund having uniform standards and having a saarc university south asian university
330668 these we were talking of for quite some time but now these are going to be the reality
330669 its an important organization of asia are we ready for that challenge is the spirit of saarc reflecting the challenge of a new era in my opinion no
330670 i am deeply troubled about the continuing threats and attacks against humanitarian agencies working in darfur
330671 following two attacks against their teams and premises in just one week m decins sans fronti res has announced it has no choice but to evacuate its team from two locations in north darfur the departure of msf team leaves some 65 000 people without essential medical assistance
330672 impunity for such attacks must end hundreds of thousands of people rely on the assistance these aid organizations deliver and we cannot afford to have them absent from darfur
330673 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
330674 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
330675 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
330676 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
330677 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
330678 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
330679 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
330680 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
330681 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
330682 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
330683 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
330684 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
330685 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
330686 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
330687 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
330688 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
330689 the question of power has been settled by the elections
330690 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
330691 it is not the letter of the word that ordinarly doth convert but the spiritual meaning of it as revealed and expounded
330692 it is the meaning of the word which is the word indeed it is the sense of it which is its soul
330693 the text is the word of god abridged preaching is the word of god enlarged
330694 it is not the nature of the thing that carries such power in it but it is the institution of god and the ordinance of god in it
330695 we are to come to hear the word as an ordinance appointed by god to convey spiritual food to the soul
330696 for men that are of some understanding and parts talents when they come to hear this temptation is ready to come upon them that except they hear some new thing that they did not understand before wherefore should they come now this is a great mistake
330697 pray beforehand that god would open thine eyes and open thine heart and accompany his word now
330698 we must deal with our hearts to embrace the word the gospel is not only to be let in by our apprehension but to be locked in by our affections and we are to entertain it not only in the light of it but in the love of it
330699 faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of christ
330700 th amp 8221 to thomas twitchell hope deferred makes the heart sick but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life i agree when we set phil mccheddar nathan yes i do agree with your latest comment i am concerned about the spiritual state april 2007

330704 he was a freshman and i was a sophomore at ucla
330705 ive known him since he was a probably 16 were good friends from way back
330706 the coaching the reputation that they have the good players that have gone there its a prestigious school academics and athletics wise it was a great fit for me and obviously for marvell
330707 i hit a few fairways a few greens and holed a few putts
330708 i holed a few putts and got to three under and tried not to kill any spectators on the next nine when i was hacking out of trees i managed to miss most people i think i only hit a couple
330709 i made a couple of bogeys and got up and down a hell of a lot and managed to scrape one under which left me in pretty good position today i played pretty good
330710 it was a bit degrading playing the first nine holes the way i did
330711 when youre five over its pretty ugly i didnt have my ball position right and wasnt making a very good downswing
330712 when i saw it i actually thought it was a joke quite honestly
330713 i know she is going to sell a lot more tickets than i will but i would say its surprising i dont think its a real popular decision out here
330714 the only thing i can control is myself a good score will resolve everything
330715 shes a great player and she will make the cut in a pga tour event
330716 mediocre people are jealous of the money shes making and the life she has
330717 you could pick 20 guys in reno who have missed 11 of the last 12 cuts the players dont want to understand shes part of the reason theyre playing for so much money theres no reason people should be so cruel to her
330718 ill be out skiing the super bowl is all sound and fury signifying nothing

330721 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
330722 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

330724 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
330725 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
330726 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
330727 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
330728 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
330729 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
330730 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
330731 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
330732 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
330733 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
330734 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

330751 frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause
330752 to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
330753 is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the bible as many evangelicals do
330754 democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion specific values it requires that their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason i may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons but if i seek to pass a law banning the practice i cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke gods will i have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all
330755 the union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution honoring honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society

330766 little house on the prairie is a brand that people want and its our responsibility to make sure it lives up to its name
330767 the shows got to be correct it is very much a work in progress and we hope we get it right at the guthrie
330768 when you cast a show you often talk about who you wish you could get

330773 as a kid i read the books and then when my children were growing up we watched the tv show
330774 i think its obviously a huge thing for young girls who have read these books

330783 im counting down the days until obama changes his own mind out of political expediency
330784 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
330785 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
330786 the oil companies are shoving this thing down the throats of congress because they know everybody wants to try to pretend theyre doing something about the energy crisis
330787 this is not real i know its tempting the polls say its one of the ways that a majority of americans think were going to solve this problem but its not real
330788 i understand how desperate folks are if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey id do it
330789 the soonest you would see any drop of oil from drilling off our shores would be 10 years from now the most you would end up saving 10 years or 20 years from now would be a few cents on the gallon although at that point i figure oil might be 12 a gallon

330972 a shaman is a man or woman who enters an altered state of consciousness at will to contact and utilize an ordinarily hidden reality in order to acquire knowledge power and to help other persons

331035 most of the assets of the church of england in terms of buildings schools and other property either come from the pre reformation catholic church or as a direct result of the tractarian and catholic revival

331043 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
331044 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients

331052 that embraces everything with the priests we have the parishes the whole country
331053 now listen i want to get the priests that is our principal apostolate
331054 is to labour for multipliers let the holy eucharist become the centre of their thoughts the end of their labours and they will have at their disposal the most efficient means for the conversion and sanctification of their people let them find in jesus of the tabernacle a friend in their loneliness insurmountable strength in their struggles constantly renewed vigour in their weariness for he is the source of grace which produces abundant fruits
331055 i want to form secular priests to bind them together by prayer by determinate statutes and to sanctify them by the blessed sacrament of the altar this work is ours but i do not want to undertake now on a large scale oh when will the time come priests sharing in the life of the blessed sacrament should live according to the eucharistic life of jesus which consists above all in self abnegation and the love of sacrifice they should perform all their duties under the protection of the blessed virgin the adoratrice of the cenacle for through that sweet mother we more easily approach jesus their studies their energy and their piety they should direct to the blessed sacrament of the altar they should bear in mind that adoration is their chief duty nos autem orationi instantes erimus but we will give ourselves continually to prayer
331056 full of zeal to announce the teaching of the divine master when he came down from mount sinai like the apostles coming from the cenacle so should the priests of this society go from the church straight to the people to announce to them the word of god
331057 they should bind themselves to defend always and under all circumstances the interests and the honour of jesus christ and by every possible means to multiply visits to the blessed sacrament as well as frequent and daily communion in a word in all their actions they should unite with jesus in the blessed sacrament the eternal high priest the model of the grace of the priesthood

331111 this is sort of like what would happen in ancient times when people would make lots of noise to scare away the demons and dragons that were eating the sun

331137 theres a lot of people out there that seem to be displeased with it but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
331138 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guy that can get the footy and then focus on the goal kicking

331161 it is important to have certain guidelines laid down ahead of time guidelines to which you can cling and hold firmly enough that they weather the storm of emotions in time of crisis this is a matter in which your convictions must be hammered out on the anvil of scripture and moral principles before it is necessary to apply them in time of stress they must be settled in the quietness of the study lest the maelstrom of the actual crisis cause you to be swayed and you find yourself with situationally determined standards
331162 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness so that the man of god may be adequate equipped for every good work
331163 then god said let us make man in our image according to our likeness they will rule the fish of the sea the birds of the sky the animals all the earth and the creatures that crawl on the earth so god created man in his own image he created him in the image of god he created them male and female
331164 whoever sheds mans blood his blood will be shed by man for god made man in his image

331166 to signify the act of taking the life of a person who is hopelessly ill and doing so for reasons of mercy
331167 any act or deliberate omission undertaken by oneself and or others that intends to cause and does cause the death of a person whereby the parties involved act upon a conviction that the death caused will be good for the person being killed
331168 to use the word killing is technically correct since both action and neglect in particular contexts result in a death that is intended euthanasia is allegedly killing for merciful reasons for reasons of compassion the absence of malice associated with the acts of euthanasia tends to soften our reaction to it we are less inclined to label these acts killing yet they are
331169 there is a time to give birth and a time to die
331170 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
331171 without discrimination based on your age or physical or mental disability or the quality or your life
331172 any action or omission that is intended to cause or hasten death
331173 jesus must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet the last enemy to be abolished is death
331174 by faith jacob when he was dying blessed each of the sons of joseph and he worshiped leaning on the top of his staff by faith joseph as he was nearing the end of his life mentioned the exodus of the sons of israel and gave instructions concerning his bones
331175 your compassions are many lord give me life according to your judgments
331176 come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me

331188 please let us be healthy and happy for a long long time
331189 i have become all things to all men so that i may by all means save some
331190 we dont need to be concerned about people in our community we should just take care of our own
331191 for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same
331192 my father is working until now and i myself am working

331195 the harvest is abundant but the workers are few therefore pray to the lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest
331196 there are three emphases that every church in every culture needs in order to faithfully proclaim the gospel they need to understand what jesus called them to do what culture they are in and what a biblical church looks like a missional church lives at the intersection of three things
331197 for this reason i have sent to you timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord
331198 but you know of his timothys proven worth that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father
331199 i appeal to you for my child onesimus whom i have begotten in my imprisonment
331200 here for this third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be a burden to you for i do not seek what is yours but you for children are not responsible to save up for their parents but parents for their children
331201 but we proved to be gentle among you as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children
331202 you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each of you as a father would his own children
331203 i do not write these things to shame you but to admonish you as my beloved children for if you were to have countless tutors in christ yet you would not have many fathers for in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel
331204 now in a like exchange i speak as to children open wide to us also
331205 my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may not sin
331206 i am writing to you little children because your sins have been forgiven you for his names sake
331207 children it is the last hour and just as you heard that antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have appeared
331208 little children let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth
331209 you are from god little children and have overcome them
331210 i have no greater joy than this to hear of my children walking in the truth
331211 mix it half and half and you get madness unmixed bodily collapse
331212 all things are lawful for me but not all things are profitable all things are lawful for me but i will not be mastered by anything
331213 do not merely look out for your own personal interests but also for the interests of others
331214 it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles
331215 whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
331216 do not get drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be filled with the spirit
331217 you will make known to me the path of life in your presence is fullness of joy in your right hand there are pleasures forever
331218 the peace of god which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus

331249 it took me a long time to get over last year
331250 i thought a month after the season he still looked miserable
331251 everything you did well in the first part of the season has to be taken up a level and you have to spend extra time studying and preparing because opponents now know what youre capable of
331252 so you have to understand how the defense is going to attack you in different ways and we didnt understand that last year
331253 we didnt show the professionalism and the commitment to get where we wanted to go its not just about showing up on sunday and if you dont know your stuff inside out youre not going to stand a chance

331255 it talked about considering it pure joy whenever you face trials of many kinds because that develops perseverance and perseverance creates character thats kind of the epitome of what ive been through in this league but im a better man because of it and i feel totally blessed to start year 13
331256 i wish i could run that good at his age
331257 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
331258 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
331259 it may be the worlds ugliest dolphin some people have said that
331260 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
331261 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
331262 lets just say brandon took advantage of the opportunity at the right time
331263 lynch showed what he did in college which is make plays
331264 but really his best play wasnt the interception it was that third down when he made the tackle on the sideline
331265 we tell the guys all the time youve got to take your shot
331266 but on that play he doesnt have anyone backing him up if he misses the tackle and he took the shot and made the tackle
331267 stopping the run is very important and it looked like we defended the run pretty darn well
331268 some of us are like teabags whose true strength comes out when were put in hot water so when problems beset you just think of yourself as gods favourite cup of tea
331269 everything looked pretty good we got a lot done today
331270 i just cut down on fatty foods and late night snacks i wanted to feel more swift on the field and be in shape and go more plays without taking a break its a lot easier when you dont have to worry about that part of the game
331271 i worked on my core and that helped i really felt it in my throwing there was a lot more velocity coming out i could keep my balance and also being accurate a lot of people dont think about that a lot of people think i can use that in the scrambling game but i look at it for throwing
331272 sean is right behind me its going to go on with sean and i hes a great competitor hes going to push me like im going to push him sometimes it gets tiring hearing about the qb competition but sometimes its good about competition its good for the team
331273 i get a couple text messages a day about it from friends and family seeing me in articles its exciting knowing people back at home are following but i try to keep that out of my mind right now im building off of last season training camp was a lot tougher last year because you had to learn the basics now that i know the basics its all about details
331274 im just trying to get out there and get my technique down and not go too fast no im not 100 percent at this point but im working toward it im confident the knee holding up
331275 the coaches dont want me to go too hard right away
331276 i was told to take it easy and get to the season but the formerly broken ankle is all good
331277 i couldnt do all the training with the team in the summer i did a lot of biking and a lot of rehab i did as much as i can without putting a pounding on my knee
331278 overall we are going to be good with or without me but i want to contribute the way i have been
331279 i dont like to put a specific time when ill be back im shooting for the first game if not that game then the next game and if not that one then the next one
331280 theres no doubt im playing the hawaii game no matter what shape im in
331281 well attack the symptoms as we go there will be some good days and some not so good
331282 were the architects secretly having a contest to try and design the most hideous buildings possible
331283 ill chase your golf ball on every hole if you can do that each time
331284 we dont offer colors we dont offer flavors we offer protection
331285 most places you can go in you can buy beer you can buy some liquor but you cant always find a condom
331286 i think it is a good step forward in that if the condoms are affordable and accessible to the population that needs it most perhaps we will see more usage of the condoms
331287 i didnt see any big signs that something like this would occur when we were seeing each other
331288 im beginning to believe it isnt worth the piece of paper its written on
331289 victims need to collect any information that law enforcement can use so they will know when and where to find the offender thats very helpful
331290 i feel like if im hurt or killed then someone will wake up and listen
331291 i noticed a couple of days ago that sen obama challenged me to a duel
331292 theyve got some tooty fruity stuff you know the mccain as wizard
331293 we put our signs down until we could get it resolved were not activists
331294 its always a good thing to open up the city
331295 youre gonna get a lot of the older people coming out looking at the cars
331296 as floridians are waking up to news that our state is in a recession for the first time in 16 years john mccain proved how out of touch he is by wearing 520 ferragamo shoes to his country concert
331297 god does not belong to the class of existing things not that he has no existence but that he is above existing things even above existence itself
331298 the name of god which in hebrew is spelled yhwh is difficult to explain
331299 existence existence refers to what is finite and fallen and cut of from its true being within the finite realm issues of conflict between for example autonomy greek autos self nomos law and heteronomy greek heteros other nomos law abound there are also conflicts between the formal emotional and static dynamic resolution of these conflicts lies in the essential realm the ground of meaning the ground of being which humans are cut off from yet also dependent upon in existence man is that finite being who is aware both of his belonging to and separation from the infinite newport p 67f therefore existence is estrangement
331300 although this looks like tillich was an atheist such misunderstanding only arises due to a simplistic understanding of his use of the word existence what tillich is seeking to lead us to is an understanding of the god above god we have already seen earlier that the ground of being god must be separate from the finite realm which is a mixture of being and non being and that god cannot be a being god must be beyond the finite realm anything brought from essence into existence is always going to be corrupted by ambiguity and our own finitude thus statements about god must always be symbolic except the statement god is the ground of being although we may claim to know god the infinite we cannot the moment god is brought from essence into existence god is corrupted by finitude and our limited understanding in this realm we can never fully grasp or speak about who god really is the infinite cannot remain infinite in the finite realm that this rings true can be seen when we realize there are a multitude of different understandings of god within the christian faith alone they cannot all be completely true so there must exist a pure understanding of god essence that each of these are speaking about or glimpsing aspects of
331301 what is it to be in this universe where there is only god
331302 luthers concept of god is one of the most powerful in the whole history of human and christian thought this is not a god who is a being beside others it is a god who we can have only through contrast
331303 and i would say very dogmatically that any doctrine of god which leaves out one of these elements does not really speak of god but of something less than god
331304 i have serious problems about ranking law schools and the methodology but its a fact of life
331305 not participating not only wouldnt accomplish getting rid of the rankings it could be worse than it is now
331306 as long as they tell us that we need to do that we dont have a hell of a lot of choice
331307 i think it has a real effect if the deans dont participate
331308 i have repeatedly asked judges and lawyers in new york and los angeles if they have ever had their view solicited by u s news
331309 i have yet to meet one person who received a ranking form
331310 im going to do my best and have a great experience and enjoy it and do my best
331311 i hope to compete well and hopefully good things will happen after that
331312 i have spoke sic to pat regarding his comments earlier this week we had a good discussion of the issues surrounding college baseball and our baseball program i continue to have great admiration for him as a quality young man
331313 greg van zant has dedicated 13 years to wvu as head baseball coach he has accomplished a great deal for the program during that time and continues to have my support as an outstanding leader
331314 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
331315 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
331316 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
331317 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
331318 i wish i could get approved for an auto loan

331323 no no no i know its the eyedrops i use them and my eyes get sleepy
331324 im glad rphmommy was working she handled those guys better than anyone else could have she got all gangster telling them to get out of the pharmacy
331325 the burns looked like they were a week and a half old it looked like a small infection had begun
331326 the main thing you are trying to prevent on a burn is infection or any type of external debris sticking to it
331327 the best thing to do is put dry sterile gauze on the wound
331328 i came back because i got a job here to help both the iraqis and americans supporting the war on terrorism
331329 its always good to help the iraqis to know whats going on and what they are going through
331330 we are dealing with very basic medications here but we are helping at least 60 to 70 percent of the population
331331 basically what we try to do is give them our advice if we cant treat them here go see a specialist
331332 others we give medication especially for those who havent seen a doctor in years and dont have access to medical care when they get the antibiotics and painkillers i think it will be great for them in the long run
331333 for me there is no greater reward to be able to help somebody put a smile on somebodys face
331334 i wanted to do something to give back to the people of iraq and you guys because you work so hard for me
331335 the first time i was here i ran the roads so i didnt get to interact a whole lot with the people of iraq
331336 i didnt know what to expect when i came on this tour
331337 the last time i didnt have the opportunity i have now
331338 i thought they would send things over but it grew to a much larger thing
331339 he is very good to us said ninos emanuel esha a crew supervisor and father of a little girl named venessa
331340 this last thing that hes done for us for our kids for our families we are very appreciative for him it increases confidence between us and the americans
331341 i couldnt ask for a better crew or better supervisor the relationship i have with them is just beyond anything i could expect
331342 im sorry i was just getting around to cleaning it
331343 are you going to clean your mess some time soon
331344 im sorry that you had to be roomed up with me

331353 from time to time we and kbr have engaged in discussions with the sec and the doj regarding a settlement of these matters
331354 has evidence of payments to nigerian officials by another agent in connection with a separate kbr managed project in nigeria called the shell ea project
331355 of an immigration services provider apparently managed by a nigerian immigration official to which approximately 1 8 million in payments in excess of costs of visas were allegedly made between approximately 1997 and the termination of the provider in december 2004 and our 2007 reporting of this matter to the government
331356 the head of a company can be charged with misuse of corporate assets for bribes paid by any employee even if the executive didnt know about the improper payments
331357 in the absence of any disclosure the investing public was deprived of a full opportunity to assess halliburtons reported income more particularly the precise nature of that income and its comparability to halliburtons income in prior periods
331358 significant difference in their respective effects on halliburtons financial presentation the new practice reduced losses on several large construction projects
331359 was aware we accrued revenue on unapproved claims in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
331360 the developments at halliburton since cheneys departure leave two possibilities either the vice president did not know of the magnitude of problems at the oilfield services company he ran for five years or he sold his shares in august 2000 knowing the company was likely headed for a fall
331361 one of the things i like that they do for us is that in effect i get good advice if you will from their people based upon how were doing business and how were operating over and above the just sort of the normal by the books audit arrangement
331362 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that
331363 the figure of 16 million euros has been mentioned but i dont want to comment about that
331364 i have had so many mostly estate agents from austria neighbouring bavaria and germany
331365 we manage most of the austrian lakes so by principle were interested in taking over the mondsee
331366 we recently made an alternative offer to mrs waechter well manage the lake for her for free for two years during which she will continue to receive revenues from it and then well make an offer to buy
331367 the economic factors that strained the demand for new vehicle sales in the us for the first half of 08 are still with us full force
331368 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
331369 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
331370 we are writing a new chapter in the auto industry story as customers dealers and companies adjust to a changing environment
331371 theres a lot of variation in the results that were getting
331372 it plays into the very hectic and uncertain market were in
331373 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
331374 toyota honda and nissan continue to benefit from a stronger cash position and a healthier balance sheet than gm ford or chrysler
331375 there are very few manufacturers that are really immune from a very difficult market
331376 london a mechanical brass calculator used by the ancient greeks to predict solar and lunar eclipses was probably also used to set the dates for the first olympic games researchers said on wednesday the antikythera mechanism was retrieved from a shipwreck off the greek island of antikythera in 1901 an example of the technological prowess of the ancient greeks researchers reporting in the journal nature said they had now discovered that the device made at the end of the 2nd century bc used an intricate set of bronze gearwheels dials and inscriptions to set the games date
331377 i promise to press on with reforms working consistently to share the same views as the people
331378 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister
331379 it shows his resolve to tackle pension and economic problems
331380 a state where it hasnt been in the past four years because we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate
331381 congress passed important legislation that will further efforts to obtain fair compensation for american citizens in their claims against the libyan government
331382 we hope administration efforts working with the congress will help our fellow citizens close a painful chapter in their lives
331383 the united states also looks forward to expanding its relationship with libya and its people as we resolve contentious issues from the past
331384 decision by congress provides a powerful incentive now to libya to proceed
331385 its agreed in principle how its going to happen so that should take place pretty quickly ideally
331386 and we are sufficiently reassured that there will be enough funding to satisfy our claimants
331387 the numbers that have been thrown out in the press are not inaccurate it is a very substantial sum of money
331388 i think that if we do this arrangement those matters will go away and we will be able to move ahead in normalizing
331389 this deal would obviously allow a visit by the secretary of state
331390 whats a little cash here and there huh its only 6 billion dollars

331394 one approach would be following newton to write down the equations for the evolution of the biosphere and solve them this cannot be done
331395 we cannot say ahead of time what novel functionalities will arise in the biosphere thus we do not know what variables lungs wings etc to put into our equations the newtonian scientific framework where we can prestate the variables the laws among the variables and the initial and boundary conditions and then compute the forward behavior of the system cannot help us predict future states of the biosphere
331396 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
331397 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
331398 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
331399 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
331400 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
331401 how can i take a natural conversation about common things and connect it to the gospel without it coming off like an abrupt topic change
331402 even when the unrighteous escape justice in the courts god says he will not let sin go unpunished
331403 my personal desire for vengeance is often quited by gods assurance of justice
331404 in the end i find that though i am guilty of different sins i am just as guilty as
331405 part of why i am so passionate about the development of authentic community is because of how the bible portrays the need for it we are created by god to live in real community
331406 i regret that christians are often seen as a voting block of the republican party the truth is the command to love god and our neighbors points to a way that is not entirely in line with any political party
331407 our dependence on automobiles especially in the suburbs is a concern of mine not only because it only perpetuates the breakdown of localism but also because of the negative effect it has on the environment and ultimately because i believe god has given us a wonderful gift creation as well as us the responsibility to care for it
331408 war is a terrible thing but if we are going to seek to the good of others and protect the innocent sometimes war is an unfortunate necessity that doesnt make the issue easy in fact it makes it more difficult and my concern for justice is rooted in gods love of it
331409 the protagonists search for redemption is reflective of humanitys serach the fact that he doesnt find it is the common frustration of man
331410 i promise to press on with reforms working consistently to share the same views as the people
331411 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister
331412 it shows his resolve to tackle pension and economic problems
331413 he has the ability to get an olympic medal i can help but his dad is his main coach and one of the best coaches in the country i think he always listens to his dad
331414 the whole time im trying to stress to him that this is another dance i think the greatest lesson was learned at the trials that he should not try and fight the competitive scoring system
331415 when he gets to a point where he throws five or six punches in a row then hes jelling
331416 i think for the first time i got him conservative but with a certain awareness about him
331417 ten jejich zp v k je magor prej ani nej na den mu sta fla ka jacka danielse a p r gram koksu
331418 it shouldnt happen they have taken six years of not only anwars life but our lives too
331419 but i think probably i also had the image that is not tainted as a wife of a minister and the deputy prime minister i dont think there were stories about me i am pretty much clean
331420 she was 17 she is my first born daughter all i heard was suddenly she was out of the country it wasnt told to me where she was going and what she was going to do
331421 i suddenly found out she was not at home and was overseas as a mother i felt worried i was already worried about her father i have to worry about her thats how i felt it was a bit difficult emotionally but after that i accepted it
331422 when i contested the first time they knew it was because anwar was in prison and when i contested the second time too because of the same reason and in 2008 anwar couldnt contest
331423 i wasnt really a fulltime housewife i was also a patron of many societies doing charity and voluntary work and i enjoy that sometimes of course i miss it because i like simple life
331424 if you ask me what kind of image i want
331425 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
331426 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim
331427 plans to become prime minister could be derailed even though he wins the by election
331428 a by election win will give him a firmer national footing but will not resolve the numerous challenges he faces
331429 he enters the by election with a mixed bag political victory is propelling him forward but the sodomy allegation and possible arrest are setback that will impact on the voters
331430 the plan for me to become prime minister by sept 16 malaysia day is on track
331431 the sodomy allegation will be the key issue in the by election
331432 anwar is hoping a victory will vindicate him before the people whatever the verdict of a future court it would be a spectacular propaganda coup if he is charged and he goes on to win
331433 its obvious what has happened here you dont need to be a rocket scientist
331434 i dont think malaysia can afford to have a prime minister who has a huge question mark hanging over his head is he or not involved in the murder of this girl
331435 desperate and pathetic attempt to discredit and taint my political image
331436 a good word is disgust whether its sodomy or blowing up the mongolian lady
331437 people just cannot trust the word of any of these people
331438 i think there will at some point be a crisis of legitimacy
331439 the leaders seem to feel that they can get away with a lot of things so long as the masses are satisfied with the economic opportunities given to them
331440 invite our friends from across the floor to cross over and take over putrajaya
331441 since merdeka in 1957 until now this is the lowest point in our politics our image is the worst it has ever been the economy has no direction the world is laughing at us newspapers from indonesia thailand london america and the arab world are all publishing news of how bad things have become here
331442 they do this to me because i dare to stand up for the people and expose corruption in the government because i am seen as a challenger to them they say if you dare to challenge us these are the methods we will use because i am anwar ibrahim up to now i have not seen the police report accusing me of sodomy why because they have the report number but it has no contents so they can change it according to whatever statements i make
331443 they are saying he is not a specialist that he is not a sodomy doctor now the newspapers in england are writing that the worlds only sodomy doctor can be found in malaysia where is there such a thing as a sodomy or backside doctor
331444 have i not been dishonoured enough how about how azizah and my children feel if you have proof i will fight it now they dont have anything no witnesses and instead they detain the doctor for three days according to their whim and fancy
331445 why then was i made to fill up a rape victims report at the hospital
331446 next month when i want to contest the by election they might charge me with something else when we are going to putrajaya another
331447 its economy has grown by an annual average of 5 7 since 2000 and its picking up speed
331448 and its share market is one of the best performing in the world over the last year its up by 17 despite the global market turmoil the ftse is down by 13 over the period
331449 you see those oil companies look how much money theyre making lets take some
331450 a new generation of reactors will create tens of thousands of tonnes of the most hazardous radioactive waste which remains dangerous for up to a million years
331451 treated and handled properly nuclear waste is not something to fear were wont all end up with five arms and three heads if britain builds more reactors its simply nothing like as dangerous as people think in fact you can bury the nuclear waste in my back garden it wouldnt bother me a bit
331452 investors should prepare their portfolios today not only for eventual nuclear adoption but also for the energy crisis that will happen in between
331453 the financial markets are currently going through their most turbulent period in years the credit crunch continues to bite the dollar is collapsing and taking the pound down with it and a uk recession seems an inevitability commodities prices are going haywire asias on the rise theres a lot for investors to keep on top of and its changing every day thats where the fleet street daily comes in a brand new 100 free service that keeps you plugged into the financial stories that really matter
331454 its just humbling and its a blessing to see all the turnout of the people out here
331455 it helps with their medical expenses and their travel needs just to support other families
331456 my assistant director the office staff and teachers everybody said hey this is a great thing were going to do its a great cause and everybody was very supportive
331457 it just shows that people really do come together as a community as a whole to help and support
331458 to see how god puts people in your life its just a very humbling experience

331541 i feel like my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
331542 if the opportunity to play in a pga tour event comes again id think about it

331547 yo papa can i hang out with you and the rexy goddess tonight my friends will think im sooo cool

331549 i was also happy to be number two i won a lot of matches its been tough i have a lot of matches on my back
331550 its tough to play well after winning toronto last week
331551 ive known him a long time hes very talented and coming up a rising star
331552 hes a very powerful player i knew id have to be consistent in order to win
331553 but im guessing that you probably parked on the other end of the trail system by the old red gate and the new black and green one
331554 we just want to get back to the black gate
331555 and now we just want to get back to our car
331556 so did you park at the bottom of this hill or did you park on the other end and take the flatlander trail over here
331557 we parked on the other side and took flatlander over
331558 your best bet is to take flatlander right back you could always take the snicket trail but that has a few small hills
331559 cant we just get to the black gate by going down the hill and cutting across another way
331560 you could go down that hill but its steep and icy then you could turn left onto the road but its narrow and cars drive very fast on it when you get to maple hill road turn left and youll have to walk up a steep hill to get to the parking lot the flatlander trail will work much better

331563 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
331564 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
331565 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
331566 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
331567 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
331568 it is going to create some urgency in the market
331569 i think it does everything that las vegas needed i am not saying it does that for the rest of the country i feel like the market is getting better and that will only help make that happen
331570 besides the obvious beauty and charm of huatulco i was impressed that it is the only resort community in mexico to obtain green globe 21 certification
331571 it only takes a short time to get to know the locals because of their openness and gracious hospitality
331572 the people of huatulco are dedicated to preserving their environment history and culture while also welcoming tourists to discover their rich natural resources and contribute to the economy
331573 we decided a private residence club made the most sense for this unique piece of land along tangolunda bay
331574 this is the last oceanfront property on the bay to be constructed and were only developing the minimum amount necessary to create an intimate resort experience residence club owners purchase a fraction of a home and they typically visit often while were keeping the overall density low owners will keep the tourism dollar flowing to help sustain huatulcos economy
331575 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
331576 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
331577 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
331578 are you so lazy that you cant sit or stand to drink you have to lay down

331596 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
331597 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
331598 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
331599 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
331600 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
331601 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
331602 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
331603 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
331604 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
331605 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
331606 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are

331627 we fully understand that the people of burma myanmar are solely responsible for bringing about change in our country however when we are faced with the military regime which has never been reluctant to crush any political activity by brutal and excessive force we expect the united nations would be able to change the murderous behavior of the junta by diplomacy and pressure
331628 at the very least we dont want the united nations siding with the dictators and forcing the people of burma myanmar into an untenable position
331629 the elected politicians in the opposition parties are disappointed by mr gambaris performance during his previous visits the nld told him to push the military junta to have a referendum that was inclusive
331630 his visits have not given the people any hope for change he has only helped the junta to gain more legitimacy for its politics and that will oppress the people more
331631 the burmese military is going ahead with its own plans and it has no space for gambari in this agenda
331632 this is why there are so many jokes about gambaris mission to burma its lack of any meaningful progress
331633 the people inside burma have come to realize that the un has no teeth in trying to bring about change
331634 they have realized that the un can do little to help solve burmas political problems

331640 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
331641 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
331642 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action

331659 the modern education system was created in order to supply the factories of the industrial age with a reliable stream of standardized skilled labour today the industrial age is dead and the factory system is obsolete the knowledge that people need for most jobs is specialized and changes quickly but we still educate our kids in the same old way
331660 lest we forget at least an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical from all our legends mythology and history and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom lucifer
331661 where the marxist ideology of liberation had been consistently applied a total lack of freedom had developed whose horrors were now laid bare before the eyes of the entire world wherever politics tries to be redemptive it is promising too much where it wishes to do the work of god it becomes not divine but demonic
331662 there are no rules for revolution any more than there are rules for love or rules for happiness but there are rules for radicals who want to change their world
331663 whatever obamas concrete plans are they ought to aligned with his political mentor saul alinsky and his spiritual mentor and liberation theology specialist rev jeremiah wright
331664 all this is in addition to obamas long term membership in an exclusively african american church affiliated with the united church of christ founded on the teachings of black liberation theology a marxist ideology that incorporates racist concepts
331665 based on his record we could expect most of the following
331666 if that sounds extreme consider that not only did obama and clinton oppose alito pretty much all the dems did but he also opposed roberts and filibustered alito so even a mild judicial conservative which is what alito and roberts are is intolerable to obama he only wants judges who will continue the court led deconstruction of american society
331667 i feel confident that i could persuade a millionaire on a friday to subsidize a revolution for saturday out of which he would make a huge profit on sunday even though he was certain to be executed on monday
331668 its not the policy thats amazing its the fact that the government has actually made it public

331685 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the u s a that i would not be tried before this tribunal and that i should understand that for a while there would be very sharp rhetoric against me so that my followers would not hamper the implementation of the dayton agreement
331686 the whole thing does not make sense resign because of what
331687 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the u s a he switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
331688 i believe karadzic knows certain things which in any case arent pleasant for the international community
331689 i suppose that he having been involved in the events will have to say some new things which were unknown until now
331690 become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
331691 there is no doubt that this offer was made in the name of the usa
331692 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal with radovan karadzic
331693 why would anyone believe one of the most dangerous and awful mass murderers in modern history
331694 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
331695 unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
331696 when it was noticed that they were acting selectively and were reluctant to take exculpatory documents
331697 we realized that we had been tricked and that they were not investigators from the tribunal but investigators from the office of the prosecutor who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal permission
331698 unknown civilians showed me a badge so quickly that i could not identify it took me out of a public transport vehicle and held me in an unknown place for 74 hours
331699 speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger but not at all in matters of law and justice
331700 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
331701 the indictment also charges karadzic with responsibility for a protracted campaign of shelling and sniping of civilian areas of sarajevo killing and wounding thousands of civilians including children and the elderly

331722 im 100 who i am but 25 of me doesnt get to exist in my blog i have to curate my personality to serve my audience
331723 uh no it was a blog i started when i was pregnant its not about pregnancy anymore
331724 well ive heard him make references to a nice wishbone piss before but i figured it was some urban guy joke legend or something like snipe hunting or something but when i actually saw it i couldnt believe my freakin eyes i mean chuck had two completely independent and unique streams of urine coming from the same hole unfreakin believable i was like whoa thats got to be that wishbone piss thing hes always been talking about
331725 most guys go a little split stream when they pop the seal for the first time so at first i didnt notice but after about five seconds i glanced at my watch and then chuck said you got a watch on and i told him i was already on top of it dont worry about me just keep it going i told him id never seen a wishbone piss like that i mean forty three seconds may not sound like any normal piss record or nothing but split stream
331726 easy easy not too fast thats it just take care of that i got the watch easy nice nice a little more pressure nice man you got it just keep it there
331727 nice work is that chalk dude somebody needs to mark that with spray paint or something thats got to be the record i mean if you mark it with paint the record people can like have a physicist calculate time and volume from the diameter of your urethra or something far out
331728 him and gi gi his wife can sit around and plan where to eat for hours but what they are really into is planning who will bathe first for how long at what temperature and what each can do for the other to help them maintain the perfect bath for the longest amount of time you cant knock on their door and not expect to wait for at least five minutes
331729 finally when one of them comes to the door theyre always in a bath robe explaining sorry i didnt hear you at first i was taking a bath
331730 plumlee may take the pink body thing but ive seen the back of nashs nads the mans a horse
331731 ive never seen dennis plumlee naked before im really looking forward to it
331732 there he was just walkin out into the middle of the road like a goddamned idiot when all of a sudden this huge ass bus comes along and blammo
331733 i was all like hey dumbass watch where youre going what are you trying to do get yourself killed but he just looked at me like some sap and meanwhile this big freakin bus barrels down on him like a ton of bricks and then its too late
331734 when the call came in from dispatch saying that some moron had just strolled out in front of an oncoming bus my partner and i were like come on what is this a joke but when we got there sure enough there he was just laying there face flat on the market street asphalt right smack dab in the middle of the damn road i practically shit it just didnt seem possible that anyone could be that clueless but apparently this guy was one dim bulb
331735 for a guy who just got his face pureed by the grill of a bus hes doing better than one would expect if all goes well we may be able to upgrade his condition to merely seriously fucked up by weeks end
331736 he should survive that is as long as he doesnt decide to walk out in front of any more electric freakin buses in the next few weeks hello get with it people
331737 how the hell does somebody manage to get themselves hit by a big ol honkin bus like that in the first place
331738 i mean what he didnt notice the things only about the size of a freakin freight train for christs sake this fellow isnt exactly the most on the ball character youll ever meet you know even pigeons know to get out of the way of a damn bus
331739 i look down and suddenly out of nowhere theres this dipshit walking right out in front of me like i dont even know what
331740 the first thought that flashed through my mind was jesus what does this guy think hes trying to do so i blast the horn just to send a subtle little message as in by the way sir huge bus comin through over here just in case you wanted to say step aside or something but no such luck he just stood there and looked around like duh so finally once it was obvious that smart guy wasnt going to get out of the way i hit the brakes
331741 we were moving pretty fast and i couldnt stop im not a miracle worker you know
331742 well i gotta admit i wasnt exactly shocked hes always doing stupid no brained shit like that
331743 what was he thinking did he wake up this morning and say hey ive got a brilliant idea i think ill go walk into the path of a bus and get myself pounded completely flat today
331744 guys did you hear some dude totally got like whomped by a bus today
331745 its a street what do you honestly expect us to do
331746 should we put up a sign reading please do not walk out in front of any huge oncoming buses here to corner
331747 skidding dangerously across slick kitchen floors only inches away from the open jaws of angry little dogs before disappearing mysteriously into spilled sacks of dog food
331748 at first i lived in an ice machine a lot of people just assumed i had a job bagging ice not so i lived in that ice machine everyday after school id make my way through the ice bin and into the heat exchanger area behind the compressor it was my home
331749 by the time i was 18 i was almost five feet tall much too big to race through kitchens driving a miniature chuckwagon at break neck speeds screaming yee haw yee haw skidding dangerously side ways across slick kitchen floors only inches away from the open jaws of angry little dogs before disappearing mysteriously into spilled sacks of dog food
331750 i was delivering flowers one day and a lady came to the door and said hello napoleon when it hit me from then on my lifes course was set
331751 at first we built swimming pools out of little bitty holes in the side of the road then i got a contract building small homes out of discarded shoe boxes in underprivileged neighborhoods before long i was remanufacturing discarded shoe boxes in over 18 states
331752 i was determined that no more little boys would ever have to live in an ice machine again
331753 if bobs father was alive today hed be very proud
331754 the atrocities those little drivers faced almost daily whooping and screaming a skidding sideways across the kitchen floors of tennessee chased by monstrous snapping dogs is now just a footnote on the pages of history

331760 we hope he will tackle pressing policy issues head on and show bold leadership when implementing policy
331761 the prime minister is standing on an extremely severe position

331763 peoples concerns about oil and food prices continue to grow while he has to show responsible prospects for social security and tax reforms

331765 i promise to press on with reforms working consistently to share the same views as the people
331766 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister

331780 you can stand over there or else sit on the floor
331781 if jesus was here hed be sitting in the back with the ones who stood in line for hours to get in versus sitting in the special seats with those we classed as
331782 we cannot know god apart from his word implied the bible
331783 i believe that the creator put in each of us the ability to know right and wrong
331784 you shall also make a laver of bronze with its base of bronze for washing and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar and you shall put water in it aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it when they enter the tent of meeting they shall wash with water so that they will not die or when they approach the altar to minister by offering up in smoke a fire sacrifice to the lord so they shall wash their hands and their feet so that they will not die and it shall be a perpetual statute for them for aaron and his descendants throughout their generations
331785 say to aaron for the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his god
331786 i want you to be merciful i dont want your sacrifices
331787 astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel
331788 the lord does not look at the things man looks at man looks at the outward appearance but the lord looks at the heart
331789 in it i explored the idea that a christians view of good works has led to a passivity or even an unsympathetic attitude towards how our actions may negatively impact others after all good works are irrelevant in our salvation only faith in christ is required
331790 go i wish you well keep warm and well fed
331791 abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
331792 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
331793 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
331794 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
331795 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
331796 laws should only apply to those who actually harm people
331797 well you know he really needs help because he used to be catholic and his father and mother are alcoholics
331798 you know i believe theres room in heaven for catholics protestants jews and all sorts others
331799 i am the way the truth and the light and no man cometh to the father except by me
331800 at the core this attitude seem to be against the principles of love tolerance and kindness
331801 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
331802 i am the way the truth and the light and no man cometh to the father except by me
331803 lord who is it that is going to betray you
331804 if it is my will that he remain until i come what is that to you follow me
331805 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me
331806 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me
331807 follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked show no mercy have no pity kill them all old and young girls and women and little children but do not touch anyone with the mark begin your task right here at the temple
331808 fill its courtyards with the bodies of those you kill go
331809 seize all the ringleaders and execute them before the lord in broad daylight so his fierce anger will turn away from the people of israel
331810 my counsel shall stand and i shall do all my pleasure
331811 i will heal their disloyalty i will love them freely for my anger has turned from them they shall again live beneath my shadow they shall flourish as a garden they shall blossom like the vine their fragrance shall be like the wine of lebanon
331812 thus says the lord for three transgressions of israel and for four i will not revoke punishment because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals
331813 take away from me the noise of your songs i will not listen to the melody of your harps but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an everflowing stream
331814 slaves accept the authority of your masters with all deference not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh
331815 i am confident about you in the lord that you will not think otherwise but whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty i wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves
331816 taken as a collection of books describing how its writers understood god
331817 taken as a collection of books describing how its writers understood god the bible can be valuable to our faith
331818 and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the adult males and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives and their little ones and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and moses was angry with the officers of the host and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the female children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
331819 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works
331820 besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non essentials
331821 if what he jesus christ said was good and so much of it is absolutely beautiful what can it matter if he was god or not
331822 the savior and james are the only persons in all the new testament who use the word john baptist who preached to the most wicked of men did not use it once paul wrote fourteen epistles and yet never once mentions it peter does not name it nor jude and john who wrote the gospel three epistles and the book of revelations never employs it in a single instance now if gehenna or hell really reveals the terrible fact of endless woe how can we account for this strange silence how is it possible if they knew its meaning and believed it a part of christs teaching that they should not have used it a hundred or a thousand times instead of never using it at all especially when we consider the infinite interests involved the book of acts contains the record of the apostolic preaching and the history of the first planting of the church among the jews and gentiles and embraces a period of thirty years from the ascension of christ in all this history in all this preaching of the disciples and apostles of jesus there is no mention of gehenna in thirty years of missionary effort these men of god addressing people of all characters and nations never under any circumstances threaten them with the torments of gehenna or allude to it in the most distant manner in the face of such a fact as this can any man believe that gehenna signifies endless punishment and that this is part of divine revelation a part of the gospel message to the world these considerations show how impossible it is to establish the doctrine in review on the word gehenna all the facts are against the supposition that the term was used by christ or his disciples in the sense of endless punishment there is not the least hint of any such meaning attached to it nor the slightest preparatory notice that any such new revelation was to be looked for in this old familiar word
331823 a thread where christians and anyone else who chooses to join in the discussion civilly and openly discuss their beliefs in an attempt to understand them better betrays moral bankruptcy
331824 if this scene gives us a true picture of the biblical knowledge and teaching skill of the historical jesus then the natural and very effective response of the pharisees would have been not fierce anger and concerted opposition but gleeful mockery
331825 having pharisees suddenly pop up in the middle of a grainfield on the sabbath
331826 it is doubtful whether any english translation can adequately represent the qualitative emphasis that mark expresses in 15 39 by placing an anarthrous predicate before the verb
331827 the efforts of interpreters to bring these verses under control border on desperation
331828 time to get off the raft and swim for yourself
331829 would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple
331830 rsv means that he shut down the temple is also a stretch
331831 would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple
331832 would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple
331833 much closer parallels to the gospel of mark at least are afforded by the elijah and elisha cycles of the books of kings i kings chapter 17 ii kings chapter 2 and i kings 19 19 ii kings chapters 2 13
331834 i do not understand people who claim that the bible is the center of their lives
331835 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
331836 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
331837 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
331838 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
331839 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
331840 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
331841 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
331842 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
331843 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
331844 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

331938 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
331939 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
331940 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
331941 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
331942 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
331943 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

331946 once upon a time there was a beautiful princess named kyrie she loved to wear hats her very favorite hat was red with a beautiful yellow flower
331947 okay a red flower one day she was walking in the field to watch the beautiful white horses run in the tall grass
331948 yes you had blonde curly hair and you were very beautiful
331949 and i had a red hat and my red hat had a red flower
331950 yes and princess kyrie was taking a walk and she started to walk down a pebbly road and a gust of wind blew her hat off her head
331951 and then a prince came and caught the red hat for princess kyrie and gave it to her and she was so happy the end

331953 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
331954 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
331955 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
331956 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
331957 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
331958 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
331959 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
331960 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
331961 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
331962 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
331963 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
331964 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
331965 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
331966 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
331967 who are open to doing something on the production side
331968 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
331969 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
331970 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
331971 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
331972 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
331973 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
331974 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
331975 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

331978 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
331979 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
331980 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
331981 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
331982 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
331983 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
331984 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
331985 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
331986 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
331987 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
331988 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
331989 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
331990 09 11 01 this is next take penacilin now death to america death to israel allah is great
331991 we have anthrax you die now are you afraid death to america death to israel allah is great
331992 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
331993 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
331994 and despite continued white house denials four well placed and separate sources have told abc news that initial tests on the anthrax by the us army at fort detrick maryland have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica
331995 the discovery of bentonite came in an urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
331996 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun
331997 on the critical issue of who sent the anthrax its time to give credit to the abc website abcnews com for reporting rings around most other news organizations heres a bit from a comprehensive story filed late last week by gary matsumoto lending further credence to the commonsensical theory resisted by the white house that al qaeda or iraq and not some domestic ted kaczynski type is behind the germ warfare
331998 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
331999 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
332000 the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade
332001 im not sure if panic is quite the right word but it is close enough anthrax played a role in my decision to support the bush administrations desire to take out saddam hussein i linked him to anthrax which i linked to sept 11 i was not going to stand by and simply wait for another attack more attacks i was going to go to the source hussein and get him before he could get us as time went on i became more and more questioning but i had a hard time backing down from my initial whoop and holler for war
332002 anthrax remember anthrax it seems no one does anymore at least its never mentioned but right after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 letters laced with anthrax were received at the new york post and tom brokaws office at nbc there was ample reason to be afraid
332003 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
332004 today we frequently admonish people who oppose abortion euthanasia assisted suicide or capital punishment to keep their religious moral and philosophical beliefs to themselves before dispensing such admonishments in the future perhaps we should gratefully consider some of our countrys most courageous historical figures who refused to do so
332005 rabbi morris kosman is entirely correct in summarily rejecting the demands of the frederick imam for a
332006 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
332007 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
332008 letterman how are things going in afghanistan now mccain i think were doing fine i think well do fine the second phase if i could just make one very quickly the second phase is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq letterman oh is that right mccain if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made
332009 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
332010 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
332011 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
332012 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
332013 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
332014 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
332015 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
332016 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
332017 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
332018 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
332019 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
332020 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
332021 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
332022 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
332023 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
332024 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
332025 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
332026 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
332027 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
332028 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
332029 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
332030 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
332031 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
332032 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
332033 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
332034 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
332035 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
332036 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
332037 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
332038 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
332039 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
332040 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
332041 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
332042 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
332043 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
332044 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
332045 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
332046 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
332047 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
332048 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
332049 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
332050 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
332051 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
332052 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
332053 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
332054 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
332055 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
332056 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
332057 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
332058 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
332059 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
332060 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
332061 hmm silly game i dont have enough time to do this
332062 i could really care less i just dont get it
332063 what a dork he just isnt in with the latest style
332064 she better be careful as she might hurt her back picking something up that way
332065 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
332066 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications

332070 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
332071 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
332072 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
332073 despite the scaremongering of the opposition in the 10 weeks since the budget we have seen continuing solid demand for this program and i am confident that will continue
332074 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally
332075 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability
332076 however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
332077 we look forward to working with government to discuss the transitional rebate arrangements until the gross feed in tariff policy is in place

332087 i was very passionate about filmmaking one of my shorts won runner up in the kichener waterloo student film festival very exciting at the time
332088 my personal opinion is that art schools capitalize on the dreams and hopes of people and profit off it if you look at the sheer supply and demand theres a massive amount of people trying to get work in the art world a substantial amount of people will be forced to shift career paths
332089 the parents of our generation told us to follow our dreams they told us not to settle for anything less its now up to us to figure out what that concept actually means
332090 hell be only slightly detained hell meet with you in the victoria caf
332091 how very good of you to join me mr jenkins it is indeed time we met
332092 will you join me in a glass of wine mr jenkins
332093 this is a very popular restaurant dr hawke odd they seem to be turning business away
332094 the restaurant does not have its customary luncheon crowd because i reserved all the tables
332095 i want to have the utmost privacy for our discussions sir
332096 you have my fullest attention what sort of legal matter requires such precautions
332097 physically he is fairly sound but some days hes not particularly alert
332098 i like to think it is similar to my disease
332099 today im in the chair but on others i can walk fairly well
332100 likely at times you do not recognize him does he suffer from psychotic episodes
332101 unfortunately the beast is within all of us civilized behavior is a most tenuous membrane
332102 what do you think about the kind and gentle soul then
332103 i think it must still exist somewhere if it can return
332104 it is my fervent hope that we can repair the damage that permits these demons to escape
332105 dr hawke you didnt arrange this luncheon to discuss my father is there some legal matter i can help you with
332106 that money was intended to fund research on alzheimers it is desperately needed
332107 mrs dinnick knows where that money is if the hawke institute is to establish its clinical trials at the queen mary hospital then we must have it
332108 if in fact norma dinnick knows the location of these funds and i am not saying she does she claims them for herself any other position would be strenuously resisted
332109 sir the funds were raised by a conglomerate charged with the responsibility of using them for medical research mrs dinnick selfishly stands in the way of desperately needed scientific work surely she can be reasoned with
332110 dr hawke any dispute as to ownership must be determined in court
332111 i must take the proper measure of you as an opponent and a man
332112 for the first time we hope to reverse the effects of alzheimers the mildly addled will become reliably lucid the violent will become calm and stable
332113 how can you repair what has apparently already been destroyed dr hawke
332114 i do admire your energy and reserve rather like dealing with a panther in captivity
332115 you still havent answered my question dr hawke are you really claiming your research supports the hope for a cure
332116 the cruel ravages look like black tangles of neurons in the brain
332117 im so pleased harry at your interest in our project because its difficult to imagine such a miracle from reams of data could you come to our little party for the medical profession
332118 its at the st georges club this evening say about seven youll meet one of the participants in the trials and you can ask him any questions you like
332119 havent you obtained funding from any of the usual sources
332120 oh yes we do have the usual funding but it is never enough you know how niggardly governments can be with research money in both our countries
332121 george pappas raised the money to save minds mrs dinnick is preventing very important research from going forward
332122 if she understands what hangs in the balance perhaps she will change her mind
332123 some days i can discuss matters with her and some i cant
332124 on the good days mr jenkins i am sure you can be most persuasive you have a magnetic spirit sir i have no doubt that your energy can be absolutely overwhelming
332125 dr hawke ill speak with mrs dinnick but i wont promise anything
332126 i only ask that you present our case and advise me personally whether you have been successful
332127 i look forward with great eagerness to seeing you again not just for our little business at hand i am attracted by your vitality mr jenkins
332128 listen dr hawke im not certain what your intent is here
332129 not only have you a keen intellect you are also most perceptive
332130 can you imagine red without green or yellow without a lovely blue to enhance it
332131 imagine my friend becoming at least partially color blind you can see the cardinals red feathers but the leaves of the trees have become an abysmal gray the ocean is blue but the sun is a dull disc cruel reminders of the riot of color once enjoyed
332132 i like to think sir that being struck color blind or being deprived of any other sense or ability is not so different from becoming mad
332133 it is so very sad harry to be deprived of any dimensions in this riot of life when you lust for the full array of vibrant color
332134 for some the hunger is always there longing to be satisfied
332135 dr hawke i certainly sympathize with such a plight but i fail to see how this relates to the matter of my client
332136 surely its obvious harry norma dinnick must realize she could well benefit from such a drug in her lucid moments she will enjoy the full array of color but as her madness descends like gathering clouds she will experience the blotting out first of reds then of greens
332137 who knows she might even be considered as a candidate in our trials
332138 if we were to cooperate in finding the money harry then we could fight it out in court why waste time energy and money in the duplication of effort to reach the same goal we would submit all issues to court just like gentlemen you have my word
332139 ill do as i said ill present your case to mrs dinnick and report back that is when she is able to discuss matters
332140 thank you harry i rely on your word as a gentleman
332141 do say youll come to our little party at the st georges club
332142 now my dear please wheel me upstairs im afraid our little luncheon has wearied me somewhat
332143 quite successful ronnie our friend mr jenkins is a worthy opponent intelligent and perceptive we must be on our toes with him at all times but he has agreed to present our case to the dinnick woman
332144 i led him to think i was interested in him sexually
332145 thank you my dear we must have clear heads to best this gentleman he is a most worthy candidate

332154 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
332155 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
332156 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution

332159 israel the sole possessor of a nuclear arsenal in the middle east refuses to sign the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty and provide safeguards to the international community
332160 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create a precedent and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapons activities
332161 iran expresses its serious concern about the double standard policy of the united states which has and shall undermine the credibility integrity and universality of the npt
332162 i think that deep down they dont really care whats going on in the school
332163 for three years i kept my mouth shut because i didnt have tenure
332164 can you really justify students fondling a teacher on the basis of how a teacher dresses
332165 these actions will be directed not only against the ioc but against certain ioc individuals
332166 when thanou handed over her accreditation she was no more an olympic athlete
332167 we said at the time that we would review the eligibility of thanou for beijing
332168 the ioc must hand the gold medal from the sydney olympiad to ms thanou there are no legal grounds for refusing the medal
332169 there is no official charge against me so why am i being asked if i want to take part in the olympics even though i have qualified under the rules
332170 i have been maligned and my career was damaged this is still going on enough is enough
332171 it seems to me that theres a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq
332172 if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack

332175 the road to hell like the road to its sister city washington d c is paved with good intentions
332176 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
332177 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
332178 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
332179 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
332180 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
332181 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
332182 i have sworn before the alter of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
332183 the only stable state is the one in which men are equal before the law
332184 i do not have a direct link with my counterpart in the iranian navy
332185 i dont have a way to communicate directly with the iranian navy or guard
332186 that to me is an issue that does not help the security and stability in that part of the world it is a very constrained passage a very critical passage for so many countries that sort of behavior is extraordinarily unhelpful

332204 i cant understand how higher managers continue to maintain high salaries and the people who are working the baggage handlers flight attendants loaders are getting cut
332205 theyre laying off people so im wondering where the expenses are
332206 you pay more and more money for less and less service
332207 weve gotten way more complaints than last summer and last summer was a doozy
332208 i had never heard of it with john elway or dan marino so it was kind of out of the blue for me
332209 brett is one of the icons of the franchise but at the same time i played with reggie white who was an icon of the packers franchise too and they let him go he played at carolina his last year so totally big name big icon guys and two totally different approaches to the end of their careers
332210 i think if he does its because its the only option they are saying either you do this or you come back and youre going to be a backup or you might not be able to play for us at all i never knew you could hold a player hostage who just wants to play football but im finding out something new
332211 i would be surprised but i dont know youve got to be around him and understand what hes going through it depends on what they are telling him it depends on whats going on behind closed doors
332212 its a different helm over there a different organization than when i was there
332213 i dont think when former packers president bob harlan and coach mike holmgren and gm ron wolf were there i dont think this would ever have happened like this
332214 its one of those things that youve got to pay attention to
332215 you dont want it to swell its all pretty much being proactive versus where there is a problem thats not the case its just more being proactive with it and careful with it
332216 hes going to be fine from what the trainers tell me
332217 its just a minor injury it wont take long he shouldnt miss any time maybe other than a practice or two
332218 wow maybe there will be some famous people on the flight

332220 holy shit i just pushed pat obrien off the wagon why dont i just offer him the line of cocaine i have in the crack of my ass and be done with it i am a home and life wrecked i continued to bring him drinks because it is more fun to get him drunk than not

332238 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
332239 i want to know gods thoughts the rest are details
332240 the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax
332241 reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one
332242 a person starts to live when he can live outside himself
332243 i am convinced that he god does not play dice
332244 i never think of the future it comes soon enough
332245 sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing
332246 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
332247 anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new
332248 great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds
332249 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
332250 common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen
332251 science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it
332252 the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
332253 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
332254 god does not care about our mathematical difficulties he integrates empirically
332255 the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking
332256 technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal
332257 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
332258 the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible
332259 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
332260 education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school
332261 the important thing is not to stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existing
332262 do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater
332263 equations are more important to me because politics is for the present but an equation is something for eternity
332264 if a is a success in life then a equals x plus y plus z work is x y is play and z is keeping your mouth shut
332265 two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the the universe
332266 as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
332267 whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods

332269 in order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must above all be a sheep
332270 the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead
332271 too many of us look upon americans as dollar chasers this is a cruel libel even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the americans themselves
332272 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
332273 no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
332274 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind
332275 yes we have to divide up our time like that between our politics and our equations but to me our equations are far more important for politics are only a matter of present concern a mathematical equation stands forever
332276 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
332277 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
332278 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
332279 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
332280 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge
332281 now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me that means nothing people like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion
332282 you see wire telegraph is a kind of a very very long cat you pull his tail in new york and his head is meowing in los angeles do you understand this and radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there the only difference is that there is no cat
332283 one had to cram all this stuff into ones mind for the examinations whether one liked it or not this coercion had such a deterring effect on me that after i had passed the final examination i found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year
332284 one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness from the fetters of ones own ever shifting desires a finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought
332285 he who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice this disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once heroism at command how violently i hate all this how despicable and ignoble war is i would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action it is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder
332286 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

332290 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
332291 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
332292 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
332293 how was anyone ever going to be able to help you not knowing what you were going through and not knowing that all you needed was a little tender loving care
332294 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
332295 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
332296 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government
332297 issues such as operational coordination and the management of foreign liaison relationships can indeed be complex but in our profession the guiding standard is one of common sense the best solutions are those that get the job done most effectively
332298 intelligence is at its core a practical calling that by definition means a strong voice for those on the front lines those who do the day to day substantive work of intelligence
332299 we underestimated the number of firewalls out there that were deployed in front of dns servers
332300 cisco juniper citrix and a number of other firewall vendors have been absolutely scrambling to update their equipment
332301 if you have a pat firewall the best thing you can do is look through our document understand how our network is configured and if you need the fix thats provided then install the fix
332302 but at least there are no more deniers out there muddying the waters with the overblown not urgent message
332303 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important

332384 wahai rasulullah bagaimana allah swt dapat dikatakan adil padahal dia telah memberikan anak yang buta kepadaku
332385 wahai ali janganlah melakukan hubungan biologis dengan istrimu pada awal bulan bulan hijriyah pertengahan dan akhir bulan karena ada kemungkinan besar akan menyebabkan gila terkena penyakit kusta cacat anggota tubuh dan akal istri dan anak
332386 sewaktu kalian memulai hubungan suami istri dengan nama allah swt maka setan akan menjauh dari kalian namun jika tidak memulai dengan menyebut nama allah swt maka setan akan ikut campur dalam perbuatan kalian
332387 jika seorang suami melakukan hubungan biologis dengan istrinya dalam keadaan tenang tidak dalam keadaan rasa khawatir dan tidak grogi maka sperma akan masuk ke dalam rahim istrinya dalam keadaan tenang pula dan paras anak akan mirip dengan ayah dan ibunya namun jika seorang suami melakukan hubungan biologis dengan istrinya dalam keadaan tidak tenang ada rasa khawatir dan grogi maka sperma akan masuk ke dalam rahim dalam keadaan tidak tenang pula serta paras anak mirip dengan paman bibi dari kedua belah pihak dan anggota keluarga lainnya
332388 sumpah demi tuhan yang jiwaku berada di bawah kekuasaannya jika seorang suami hubungan biologis dengan istrinya sementara anaknya ada di kamarnya melihatnya mendengar omongan dan desah nafasnya ketahuilah anak tersebut tidak akan bahagia baik anak laki laki maupun perempuan maka akan menjadi pezina

332393 saya merias aisyah untuk rasulullah saw setelah itu saya datangi dan saya panggil beliau supaya menghadiahkan sesuatu kepada aisyah beliau pun datang lalu duduk disamping aisyah ketika itu rasulullah saw disodori segelas susu setelah beliau minum gelas itu beliau sodorkan kepada aisyah tetapi aisyah menundukkan kepalanya dan malu malu
332394 aku menegur aisyah dan berkata kepadanya ambillah gelas itu dari tangan rasulullah saw akhirnya aisyah pun meraih gelas itu dan meminum isinya sedikit
332395 dengan menyebut nama allah ya allah jauhkanlah aku dari setan dan jauhkanlah syaitan dari anak yang akan engkau karuniakan kepada kami
332396 maka apabila allah menetapkan lahirnya seorang anak dari hubungan antara keduanya niscaya syaitan tidak akan membahayakannya selama lamanya

332415 the lifespan of a dragonfly comprises of two stages after breeding the female dragonfly will deposit her eggs under or onto aquatic vegetation once the eggs have hatched the first stage in the lifestyle of a dragonfly can begin this stage of a dragonflys lifestyle is as an aquatic larvae or nymph this stage will generally last between one and three years during which time the larvae will act as a voracious predator of other insect larvae tadpole and even small fish most other insect species including moths and butterflies go through a pupal stage before emerging as adults however dragonflies do not pupate instead the larval form will emerge from its aquatic environment and hang from the bank or a stem from this position it will and bask in the warmth of the sunlight and undergo metamorphosis into its adult form once the larvas transformation is complete the newly emerged adult will have to wait several hours before its wings dry out and become firm enough to fly this is a critical time in the life cycle of the dragonfly as it is exposed to predation which may even come from dragonfly larvae themselves however once the adult is able to fly it becomes once more a voracious predator displaying its wonderful metallic armor as an adult its quarry will be flying insects and some of the larger dragonfly species may even predate its cousin the damsel fly life as an adult sadly is a glorious burst just long enough to reproduce the adult dragonfly will not live beyond several months depending on the quality of the weather generally speaking if the weather is dry and warm then the adult may live as long as six months however in the short and sometimes not so sweet summer of the british isles adults will tend not to live for longer than several weeks if your eyes are keenly tuned to the air above rivers lakes and ponds you may just be fortunate enough to see a beautiful dragonfly dancing and darting it is a truly marvelous sight indeed

332423 the shows got to be correct it is very much a work in progress and we hope we get it right at the guthrie
332424 when you cast a show you often talk about who you wish you could get
332425 i pick up the phone i reach for the stars and in this particular case i got her
332426 we his producing group have taken a giant step back while the guthrie produces this show
332427 we are there to help but it is the guthries production
332428 whether its midsummer or little house on the prairie our structure is such that we dont make money to put on a musical in a less than 700 seat house is not something that someone would do in a commercial venture were not sitting on a cash cow
332429 as a kid i read the books and then when my children were growing up we watched the tv show
332430 i think its obviously a huge thing for young girls who have read these books

332434 no it isnt illegal gas companies found a loophole where they can charge extra to those buying gas with their credit or debit cards the only people paying 3 89 are those paying with cash they say that it is the customers responsibility to notice if the price they are paying per gallon and the number of gallons add up correctly on the gas pump
332435 isnt there some company or organization out there the government even who regulates these kind of things and protects customers from these kind of rip offs

332447 ivy leaguers probably position themselves better for job opportunities that provide them with significant upside
332448 dartmouth kids get paid more for the same job than kids from rutgers are doing
332449 these results to some extent confirm suspicions that many people have about the importance of a persons college choice in giving them better pay opportunities down the line
332450 what we still dont know is whether or not its the training or education the school provides that drives these pay differences or if the people from those schools are just wired to self select into jobs that are likely to be paid more
332451 with a liberal arts degree its what you make of it

332460 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
332461 hes a talented kid and the fact that weve only managed to get him out on loan initially says it all because his club would have preferred to keep him
332462 so well see how it goes its always hard when you come to a new country i went through that at inter milan and it took me a few months to settle down
332463 i dont want to put too much expectation on the lad because it will take him time to settle in but i believe weve got a decent player
332464 my only wish is to play with a stronger team if zenit agrees with chelsea or arsenal i will gladly join either of them

332531 i can send back an email in a couple of seconds to someone with whom i share a certain context i can leave out all the details when i reply to him her but when i want to answer him her via my blog i also have to think about all the other people that dont share that context because they dont theyll be frustrated when they read my post writing such a post instead of an email would take more of my time or am i missing something
332532 can you just move an email conversation to a blog without providing more context to other readers
332533 no if i hated you id be trying to kill you i just dont want to talk to you
332534 just because i can deal with you around but i wont be speaking to you any longer

332541 government agencies in recent years have argued more and more against release of information by citing so called security concerns we dont think thats a claim that should be made lightly especially when it involves how those agencies are spending taxpayer money

332544 construction of a border fence has impacts to fish and wildlife resources that could not adequately be compensated for by the offer of compensation
332545 its obvious that where the wall goes wildlife and habitat will be affected
332546 the government is looking at this as a piece of dirt and not as a whole ecosystem
332547 construction of border infrastructure along the southwest border will help deter illegal immigration as well as drug trafficking and other unlawful and dangerous activity
332548 we understand the reasons that the federal government believes they need to build this fence and were certainly not in a position to make a decision whether thats right or wrong
332549 but from the texas parks and wildlife departments point of view and for us as commissioners our job is to look at the mission of texas parks and wildlife and our constituency which is the citizens of the state of texas and decide whats the right thing relative to our mission what we at texas parks and wildlife are supposed to do and not do

332617 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
332618 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro

332624 it is nice to be ranked that high but this is the preseason not the postseason
332625 it means that we accomplished some things last year and that many of the players who did those things are back a lot of it has to do with the skill position players the high profile players we have back like cullen harper james davis c j spiller and aaron kelly
332626 if the rankings motivate our players and give them a sense of urgency to retain that ranking then it is a good thing

332731 were telling our candidates to stand firm unfortunately our candidate in the close district 47 race dropped out last month but were hoping that wont happen again
332732 its no skin off my nose if republicans lose in fact if they lose control of the texas house that might be a good thing for taxpayers at the federal level when the same party controls the legislative and executive branches government grows much faster than when the control is divided divided government might be healthy for texas
332733 its ridiculous to hear republicans or democrats complain about spoilers republicans and democrats have imposed on us this absurd system of plurality elections where people can win without a majority libertarians would never have created an election system like this valid elections need runoffs or some other alternative they created the system let them deal with the consequences

333135 im very into disability awareness and public speaking about it
333136 it proves that people with a learning disability are being discriminated against in the nhs which is leading to unnecessary pain and death
333137 it is clear that there is a desperate need for mandatory learning disability training for all health care professionals and for people with a learning disability and their families and carers to be at the centre of all decisions made surrounding their health care

333143 what ive been telling people is when i went to denver its like the dog who gets put to the pound and you get a new owner and the loyalty is to that new owner and the owner treats you good
333144 i guess thats the easiest way to explain it the way mr bowlen treated everybody in the organization was unbelievable coming from where i came from they didnt treat people quite as well so you know i thought it was that way across the league and then to go to denver and to have your eyes open like that it was just unbelievable the respect and dignity it just made you want to stay there and it made you want to win for the man

333156 barisan nasional tidak perlu mengikut strategi yang dibawa oleh anwar dan sepatutnya pilihan raya kecil seperti itu tidak seharusnya diadakan kerana keadaan semuanya baik

333218 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
333219 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
333220 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
333221 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
333222 you know its terrible that her father died but its also a trip to prague so its like a funecation
333223 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
333224 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
333225 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
333226 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
333227 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
333228 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
333229 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
333230 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
333231 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
333232 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
333233 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
333234 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
333235 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
333236 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
333237 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
333238 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
333239 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
333240 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
333241 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
333242 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
333243 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
333244 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
333245 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
333246 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
333247 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
333248 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
333249 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
333250 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

333256 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
333257 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
333258 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
333259 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
333260 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
333261 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
333262 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
333263 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
333264 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
333265 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
333266 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
333267 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
333268 we stand ready to work with the new congress and whoever is elected president
333269 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
333270 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
333271 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
333272 im trying trying to walk away but i know this crush is going nowhere
333273 its like this is the day that my song is gonna be on the radio
333274 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
333275 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
333276 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
333277 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
333278 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
333279 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
333280 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
333281 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
333282 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
333283 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
333284 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
333285 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
333286 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
333287 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
333288 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
333289 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
333290 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
333291 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

333318 frankly we thought we had accommodated all of his concerns but when all is said and done which included an extensive mediation mr bahl wanted money
333319 it wasnt as if the county wasnt willing to make some sort of small financial offering but his request was very significant and it wasnt in the best interest of what the citizens would expect from us
333320 most of the plaintiffs allegations involve what happened at the jail on the part involving the st paul police department the most important fact is that the jury in the criminal case convicted the plaintiff of obstructing the legal process based upon testimony of independent witnesses its the plaintiff who acted inappropriately not the st paul police department
333321 the bottom line was if the officer had communicated with mr bahl in writing so they could have understood each other he would have given mr bahl a ticket for the red light violation and they would have gone on their way
333322 this didnt have to happen its all because mr bahl wanted to communicate in writing and the officer refused

333354 i keep thinking its just a horror movie and we saw it and were going to wake up and were going to get out of the movie theatre and tim is going to be home and were all going to go out
333355 i cant see why this guy would even attack him
333356 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
333357 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
333358 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
333359 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
333360 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
333361 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
333362 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
333363 you open a virtual movie theater and become a filmanthropist
333364 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads held high
333365 we want the sovereignty that we hold over amazonian territory and the decisions that are made in this region to be respected

333375 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
333376 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
333377 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
333378 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
333379 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
333380 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
333381 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
333382 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on

333388 it was tricky out there sometimes with the wind so to get out of there with a 66 im pleased

333391 i know its not the best era in the league but theres two months left in the season and ive got 10 wins
333392 he could keep the money i dont need that i want to continue to pitch and help the team make the playoffs
333393 youre always looking for a boost in trades and all those things
333394 well if cisco comes up here and pitches the way hes capable of it would be a huge boost for our baseball team
333395 i dont know if i would use the phrase higher
333396 we will be going into these games doing things different in terms of pre games preparation from those we have in the past
333397 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
333398 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
333399 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
333400 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
333401 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
333402 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
333403 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years
333404 and do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink nor be worried for all the nations of the world seek after these things and your father knows that you need them instead seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you
333405 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
333406 stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes truly i say to you he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table and he will come and serve them if he comes in the second watch or in the third and finds them awake blessed are those servants but know this that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have left his house to be broken into you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect
333407 im amazed by the fact that this many people came out but im also appreciative of it
333408 those fans have a reason to be optimistic and were going to embrace the situation
333409 it was a nice practice we got a lot of things done
333410 we were a little more efficient on offense than we had been in practice thats the way it usually is in camp with the defense starting out ahead and the offense having to catch up
333411 when i came out i was just blown away by how big this stadium is
333412 i cant believe they had this many people for a practice and im wondering how it will look thursday night when its filled against the new york jets in the preseason opener
333413 they told me how crazy the football fans are here and now i see it im glad to be here im glad to be playing for these people
333414 if had three thumbs id give this place three thumbs up
333415 i think its a culmination of obviously frustrating moments individually and team wise
333416 im not going into a ton of details but i certainly regretted it immediately afterward
333417 i think that played a big factor and being frustrated it was a pretty impulsive thing it was a pretty quick thing not too much thought behind it
333418 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
333419 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
333420 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
333421 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
333422 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
333423 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
333424 its hard seeing tremendous defense tremendous pitching you go in there and dont do the job its disappointing
333425 this has not been a good homestand and weve got to bounce back
333426 to win games youve got to put everything together and we have not done that on this homestand

333441 the market is extremely difficult for the foundry industry as we try to manage volatile costs and reduced demand
333442 the new daimler work will help fill open capacity at our plants in wisconsin indiana and minnesota and our hope is that additional export work fills some of the gaps at our other plants

333460 though it has been nearly 50 years since he stepped down as secretary of state the dulles papers continue to be among the most heavily used here at the mudd manuscript library
333461 this reflects the importance of his tenure as well as the time during which he served scholars travel from around the country as well as japan and europe to study his letters memoranda and speeches
333462 winston churchill reportedly said there were three kinds of u
333463 however now that i have had the opportunity to explore dulles life i cannot imagine how that could be true he was deeply involved in major world events for over 50 years and approached every task with such zeal i hope this exhibition reflects my and his enthusiasm
333464 i made a fool of myself over john foster dulles
333465 dulles was the fifth princetonian to serve as secretary of state and the length of his tenure was second only to james madisons

333472 scientists are reporting that global climate change is damaging our oceans and our daily lives even more rapidly than forecast
333473 does the epa think climate change will go away by itself well think about it tomorrow is an unconscionable conclusion for an agency whose mission is to protect the environment
333474 the latest bush administration tactic on global warming seems to be if you cant beat them delay them
333475 instead of taking action on global warming pollution from shipping and aviation two of the fastest growing sources of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide epa is yet again putting the brakes on developing innovative global warming solutions
333476 if were going to slow the melting of the arctic and save not only the polar bear but thousands of species around the world we need to implement highly effective existing environmental laws like the clean air act

333508 that gave christine a much clearer view of what she was capable of

333511 those australian girls may be faster at 50 meters but in the last 25 meters christine can get them with her technique and competitiveness

333521 we are going ahead with the tournament whether england joins up or not
333522 south africa and australia are fully on board with the various rules and regulations but the ecb is being unreasonable and continues to have objections to issues like the shareholding pattern and the governing structure but we cant wait any longer and we are going ahead its now up to the ecb to decide whether it wants to join us or not
333523 there is no question of any indian team including those from the ipl participating in any other champions league whether its organised by the ecb or anybody else anyway we must not forget that its the television revenue that decides the fate of such tournaments and its very obvious where that is headed right now the marwari in modi is laying it on to them
333524 i can confirm that pakistan will send a team because even if the ecb joins us only one team from england can participate which is middlesex
333525 as for new zealand sri lanka or even west indies they will all be taking part from next year anyway when we expand to 12 teams one of them will send the eighth team this year if the ecb stays away and refuses to send even middlesex
333526 kent will not be invited but we will be happy to welcome middlesex but for that to happen the ecb has to take a final call
333527 i would be bitterly disappointed if all four nations arent represented by their two top teams
333528 we will be discussing with our counterparts in australia south africa and india to try to iron out the last few items within the rules and regulations
333529 weve got three or four areas to resolve but were confident the champions league will take place in september
333530 we have everybody on board going forward apart from the ecb who have some reservations in terms of structure and ownership
333531 we hope the ecb will be part of it but if they are unreasonable or unable to adhere to the rules and regulations of the tournament then it will be unfortunate but they will not be able to participate
333532 we have a final meeting with our members in bombay on wednesday and hope to make an announcement then we will go ahead with or without the ecb
333533 there are many cricket tournaments that take place around the world the ecb have another one with stanford but each one caters to a different market
333534 does stanford help or hinder us neither of the two
333535 he is doing something to develop cricket in his part of the world and he has a concept in place where his team plays english teams and the winner takes all
333536 no indian team will be going there at least not with the bccis permission
333537 already more teams are lined up for next year including west indies which has confirmed its participation
333538 i would be bitterly disappointed if all four nations arent represented by their two top teams we will be discussing with our counterparts in australia south africa and india to try to iron out the last few items within the rules and regulations
333539 the champions league is an inter club event and not an international competition
333540 if india were playing close to champions trophy then it would be prudent for some objection
333541 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
333542 as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
333543 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
333544 ecb has requested and is awaiting confirmation of the regulations for this event from the organisers
333545 we are extremely happy to have middlesex on board this makes the tournament complete in every manner
333546 ideally we would like to conduct the games at the venues announced originally but there are offers from other people and the members decided to examine all the options and not to decide right now

333562 weve got three or four areas to resolve but were confident the champions league will take place in september
333563 we have everybody on board going forward apart from the ecb who have some reservations in terms of structure and ownership
333564 we hope the ecb will be part of it but if they are unreasonable or unable to adhere to the rules and regulations of the tournament then it will be unfortunate but they will not be able to participate
333565 we have a final meeting with our members in bombay on wednesday and hope to make an announcement then we will go ahead with or without the ecb
333566 there are many cricket tournaments that take place around the world the ecb have another one with stanford but each one caters to a different market
333567 does stanford help or hinder us neither of the two
333568 he is doing something to develop cricket in his part of the world and he has a concept in place where his team plays english teams and the winner takes all
333569 no indian team will be going there at least not with the bccis permission
333570 already more teams are lined up for next year including west indies which has confirmed its participation
333571 i would be bitterly disappointed if all four nations arent represented by their two top teams we will be discussing with our counterparts in australia south africa and india to try to iron out the last few items within the rules and regulations
333572 the champions league is an inter club event and not an international competition
333573 if india were playing close to champions trophy then it would be prudent for some objection
333574 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
333575 as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
333576 the ecb have written to the organisers confirming that subject to contract the board has approved the participation of middlesex the twenty20 cup winners on the proviso that the event is authorised and on agreed terms
333577 ecb has requested and is awaiting confirmation of the regulations for this event from the organisers
333578 we are extremely happy to have middlesex on board this makes the tournament complete in every manner
333579 ideally we would like to conduct the games at the venues announced originally but there are offers from other people and the members decided to examine all the options and not to decide right now
333580 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
333581 as kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad

333602 i got my first impression of the parish from the first confession i heard here i thought i had been assigned to a terrible place the very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and when questioned by the police was able to lie his way out of it he had stolen money from his parents embezzled from his employer had an affair with his bosss wife taken illegal drugs and gave vd to his sister i was appalled but as the days went on i knew that my people were not all like that and i had indeed come to a fine parish full of good and loving people
333603 ill never forget the first day our parish priest arrived

333606 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
333607 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
333608 a clearly stated commitment of nondiscrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life

333612 that sounds heard rumors to the effect that he rudder had an os project in place
333613 mere mortal developers need a programming model application model that lets them distribute processing to massively parallel devices without having to become experts
333614 even with the quad core intel chips today you have to have specialist teams to take full advantage of them
333615 im going to assume that eliminating dynamic loading doesnt prevent dynamic language execution
333616 be clear that restricting dynamism at the os level will not impact dynamism at the programming level
333617 why shouldnt the average developer begin to think in terms of lightweight asynchronous services
333618 after all thats the migration path were seeing on the web
333619 this allows existing development tools to be easily repurposed while a lot of the complexity is hidden from the developer that is using it we essentially see declarative programming replacing imperative programming at the os level
333620 i wonder if microsoft concluded this sort of 10 year sea change was needed before kicking oslo into high gear
333621 a lot of these problems are being solved at least partially by the ideas of store and forward and message synchronization
333622 google gears adobe air even the mobile oses with things like sms can handle occasional connectivity why shouldnt this be built into core os communication protocols especially if they are asynchronous by default
333623 a very smart compiler or runtime could move a calculation onto a gpu or distribute it across cores
333624 in a world where moores law doesnt imply the speeding of individual components where does this expectation come from and who holds it
333625 reflects the reality of programming today the vast majority of professional developers especially those in it and out on the web dont deal with low level constructs unless youre a game developer isv or systems programmer there really isnt the need to do pointer math
333626 on the one hand the phrase strong notions of immutability has serious implications if meant formally but elsewhere we see thread safety remains elusive and a laundry list of things that might contribute to a solution
333627 in this scenario you establish midori not so much as a replacement for windows
333628 but as the hub of a new type of distributed system which windows machines connect into until they are no longer needed
333629 this is the second attempt at re implementing os scheduling that ive seen announced in as many months
333630 steve jobs talked at the apple worldwide developers conference on june 9 about how snow leopard was going to have a new scheduling framework that would make take advantage of multicore easier for os x developers this seems to reach similar conclusions and then take it to the next step in terms of scheduling flexibility

333638 investigators say right now there is no motive to the crime and they dont know if johnson has any connection to any of the victims

333641 thus it would seem unrealistic of the younger generations of guyanese muslims who have returned to guyana from the arab world to demand the cleansing of established traditions which has caused great tension in the community guyanese muslims themselves have come to guyana from a region with a rich history in art architecture literature math music science philosophy and theology and so they have a rich heritage of their own this should be recognized by the learned men they should strive for unity in preserving the uniqueness of guyanese muslim culture speaking arabic or dressing like an arab wont make one an arab or a muslim it only reinforces low self esteem and erects a barrier between them and other muslims as well as non muslims

333651 he noted that israels policy of refusing building permits to many of the 250 000 palestinians in east jerusalem has resulted in
333652 it is believed that three out of every four palestinian homes in the city are now built without a permit
333653 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
333654 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
333655 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
333656 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
333657 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that
333658 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
333659 although such outbreaks are difficult to control this may be possible by combining rigorous infection control measures with appropriate use of antibiotics
333660 that was the conclusion of a group of leading european scientists working on behalf of the centre to analyse existing protocols and make recommendations on infection control measures to limit the spread of c difficile
333661 though c difficile as such is not a new microbe the emergence and spread of hyper virulent new strains mostly the so called pcr ribotype 027 have contributed to multiple outbreaks in hospitals and care homes in europe

333691 this operation is significant in that it signals a step forward for the iraqi armys ability to conduct self sustained and long term unilateral operations in the salah ad din province
333692 the ia has shown marked improvement in recent months in its ability to gather intelligence disrupt enemy activity and gain the trust and confidence of the iraqi people the initial stage of this operation is simply a tribute to their continuous efforts
333693 gets nearly all its facts wrong e very number in the ad is wrong except one and even that number is rounded upward so generously as to flunk third grade arithmetic
333694 snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
333695 has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama t hese baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper
333696 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
333697 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
333698 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
333699 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
333700 included some assertions from the mccain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading
333701 i have become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
333702 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
333703 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
333704 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
333705 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
333706 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
333707 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
333708 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
333709 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
333710 they can only make a small difference at the margins
333711 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
333712 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
333713 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
333714 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
333715 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
333716 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
333717 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
333718 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
333719 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
333720 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
333721 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
333722 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
333723 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
333724 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
333725 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
333726 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
333727 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
333728 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
333729 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
333730 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
333731 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
333732 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
333733 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
333734 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
333735 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
333736 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
333737 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
333738 were going to get a whole new place and its going to be better than ever
333739 i have to contact every group that scheduled an event here and say im sorry but we dont have a hotel right now
333740 they know the state little by little has been raising the standards
333741 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
333742 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
333743 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
333744 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
333745 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
333746 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
333747 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
333748 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
333749 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
333750 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
333751 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
333752 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
333753 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
333754 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
333755 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
333756 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
333757 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
333758 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
333759 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
333760 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
333761 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
333762 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
333763 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
333764 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
333765 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
333766 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
333767 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
333768 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
333769 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
333770 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
333771 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
333772 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
333773 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
333774 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
333775 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
333776 i love you i miss you so much and remember youre always a princess
333777 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
333778 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
333779 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
333780 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
333781 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
333782 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
333783 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
333784 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
333785 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
333786 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
333787 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
333788 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
333789 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
333790 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
333791 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
333792 he just said we need to do all these things
333793 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
333794 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
333795 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
333796 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
333797 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
333798 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
333799 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
333800 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
333801 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
333802 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
333803 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
333804 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
333805 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
333806 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
333807 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
333808 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
333809 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
333810 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
333811 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
333812 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
333813 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
333814 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
333815 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
333816 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
333817 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
333818 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
333819 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
333820 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
333821 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
333822 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
333823 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
333824 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
333825 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
333826 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
333827 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
333828 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
333829 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
333830 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
333831 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
333832 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
333833 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
333834 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
333835 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
333836 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
333837 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
333838 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
333839 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
333840 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
333841 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
333842 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
333843 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
333844 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
333845 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
333846 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
333847 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
333848 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
333849 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
333850 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
333851 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
333852 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
333853 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
333854 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
333855 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
333856 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
333857 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
333858 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
333859 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
333860 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
333861 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
333862 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
333863 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
333864 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
333865 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
333866 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
333867 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
333868 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
333869 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
333870 are you better off now than you were four years ago
333871 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
333872 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
333873 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
333874 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
333875 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
333876 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
333877 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
333878 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
333879 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
333880 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
333881 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
333882 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
333883 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
333884 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
333885 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
333886 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
333887 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
333888 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
333889 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
333890 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
333891 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
333892 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
333893 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
333894 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
333895 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
333896 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
333897 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
333898 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
333899 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
333900 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
333901 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
333902 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
333903 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
333904 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
333905 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
333906 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
333907 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
333908 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
333909 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
333910 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
333911 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
333912 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
333913 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
333914 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
333915 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
333916 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
333917 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
333918 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
333919 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
333920 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
333921 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
333922 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
333923 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
333924 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
333925 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
333926 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
333927 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
333928 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
333929 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
333930 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
333931 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
333932 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
333933 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
333934 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
333935 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
333936 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
333937 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
333938 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
333939 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
333940 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
333941 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
333942 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
333943 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
333944 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
333945 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
333946 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
333947 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
333948 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
333949 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
333950 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
333951 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
333952 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
333953 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
333954 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
333955 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
333956 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
333957 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
333958 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
333959 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
333960 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
333961 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
333962 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
333963 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
333964 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
333965 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
333966 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
333967 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
333968 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
333969 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
333970 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
333971 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
333972 we are borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
333973 i for one do not believe our country can withstand 10 more years of the status quo
333974 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can america has led every major technological shift in the last 100 years and we can lead the next one as well the problem is not technology it is political will
333975 mr gore has moved a long way from the solutions recommended in
333976 we couldnt come close to his goal of producing all our electricity from solar wind and geothermal energy in 10 years without coercive even authoritarian government
333977 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
333978 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
333979 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
333980 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
333981 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
333982 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
333983 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
333984 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
333985 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
333986 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
333987 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
333988 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
333989 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
333990 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
333991 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
333992 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
333993 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
333994 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
333995 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
333996 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
333997 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
333998 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
333999 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
334000 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
334001 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
334002 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
334003 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
334004 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
334005 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
334006 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
334007 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
334008 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
334009 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
334010 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
334011 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
334012 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
334013 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
334014 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
334015 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
334016 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
334017 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
334018 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
334019 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
334020 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
334021 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
334022 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
334023 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
334024 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
334025 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
334026 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
334027 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
334028 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
334029 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
334030 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
334031 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
334032 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
334033 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
334034 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
334035 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
334036 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
334037 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
334038 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
334039 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
334040 oh well i didnt see it i think its kinda stupid
334041 im just too old hat for it in fact the other two i didnt even know who they were i knew who paris hilton was but then there were other two young girls
334042 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
334043 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
334044 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
334045 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
334046 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
334047 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
334048 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
334049 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
334050 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
334051 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
334052 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
334053 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
334054 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
334055 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
334056 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
334057 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
334058 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
334059 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
334060 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
334061 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
334062 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
334063 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
334064 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
334065 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
334066 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
334067 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
334068 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
334069 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
334070 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
334071 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
334072 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
334073 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
334074 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
334075 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
334076 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
334077 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
334078 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
334079 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
334080 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
334081 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
334082 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
334083 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
334084 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
334085 you know its not about you its about your country
334086 leonid nevzlin has always relied on israels independent judiciary system
334087 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
334088 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
334089 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
334090 to be honest i havent really thought about that at all
334091 im just playing every game on its merits and just keep playing consistent football and if that comes it comes
334092 it doesnt really come into my head if im kicking goals and points are still there and were winning ive got no problem with it
334093 were pleased with the contribution he makes for our footy club
334094 theres a lot of people out there that seem to be displeased with it but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
334095 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guy that can get the footy and then focus on the goal kicking
334096 the way that we look at it he is a very very dangerous forward and what its doing is opposition sides are starting to double team him and thats going to create opportunities for other forwards in the side
334097 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
334098 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
334099 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
334100 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
334101 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
334102 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
334103 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
334104 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
334105 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
334106 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
334107 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
334108 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
334109 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
334110 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely

334116 cerebral palsy may result in an inconvenience when it comes to raising a child but it is manageable
334117 due to shyloes unwillingness to care for a child with special needs destiny lost her life
334118 this whole field is highly contested because its mixed up with the issue of abortion this kind of case can bring out a lot of deep deep emotions so its hard to think through on a legal basis
334119 destiny suffered severe brain hemorrhaging and brain damage but she certainly was not brain dead by any definition she was able to move around
334120 i dont like the job that i have now im just going to be honest not used to being put down and i dont like it because i never put people down but in the customer support industry you get put down and theres a lot of racism going on

334122 our dog was sick and looked lethargic and just kind of out of sorts
334123 we think also that it could be intentional and its not like someones targeting one animal but theyre just doing this at will which concerns us also
334124 it could be a hot dog thats injected with antifreeze

334128 when we met coach jack del rio told me theres a roster spot on this team and i can go out there and earn it thats all im trying to do
334129 the key is will he continue to do that and sustain that
334130 you see from the things that hes doing that he can be pretty darn good if we can get him to fight through soreness fatigue all those types of things and continue to play at a high level
334131 when my bodys healthy i think i can play with anybody and i think i can do a lot of good things and help this team win it definitely feels good
334132 were talking about having a shot at him by week four week five certainly for our bye week which comes in week seven
334133 were going to get him for the last 10 games of our regular season and hopefully we earn our way beyond that
334134 the police shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business when it comes to their personal life
334135 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
334136 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
334137 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
334138 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
334139 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
334140 este a o es de transici n y no hay que correr
334141 yo llevo tres a os en el rayo y es la primera vez que en la concentraci n de segovia no tengo sin cerrar toda la plantilla con la que voy a contar pero es que este a o no tenemos prisas por fichar los anteriores fueron diferentes porque persegu amos el ascenso y hab a que correr pero este es de transici n para nosotros y la base est hecha mejoraremos pero no tenemos prisa por fichar
334142 fue un partido que quiz s se nos dio demasiado bien aunque hubo dos partes distintas en la primera tuvimos el control y jugamos m s ordenados en la segunda tal vez por la comodidad del 0 3 con el que llegamos al descanso nos desajustamos sin embargo creamos m s ocasiones de gol ahora quiero ver al equipo en un partido con m s exigencias
334143 el problema es que nos llega demasiado pronto el rival lleva ya cinco amistosos y un mes prepar ndose espec ficamente para la champions y est m s rodado pero para ese choque me basta con que mi equipo haga tres cosas que est junto que d salida al bal n y que tenga las ideas claras
334144 me interesa la opci n de murcia nos pasaron una oferta y s lo falta el acuerdo entre los clubes por una serie de cl usulas me hablaron de una cesi n por una temporada y tres m s ya como jugador murcianista quiero que se solucione lo antes posible y viajar a murcia ya antes de que falte demasiado poco para empezar
334145 las posturas est n muy cercanas s lo tenemos que terminar de aceptarlas

334147 this is a global collaboration that spans the industry spans academia and government
334148 i ask that the news media respect both my privacy and the privacy of my family as we deal with our current circumstances
334149 i will not participate in any interviews or discussions with media my family appreciates the kindness shown to us during this period
334150 i am actually assuming that since that has happened the security is probably the best its ever been
334151 any reasonable person probably understands that last weeks events are probably not the norm around here and we are going to make sure that it is not the norm going forward

334158 sorprendido por la gente que me ha llamado para que vaya a jugar pero aqu estoy muy bien y me quiero quedar si el club no dice lo contrario
334159 debo tantas cosas a tanta gente que me gustar a corresponderles jugando y haciendo una buena temporada en este equipo

334163 gang members do not want be detected they want to continue their criminal enterprise so theyre going to move and try to be as fluid as they can be without being detected
334164 we are starting to see the manifestation of the first generation of gangs rooted here in north carolina
334165 the incident at the mall that certainly was a warning flag for everybody that we need to be looking at this issue because its spilling over
334166 i think most gang experts will tell you that were probably five years behind whats really going on
334167 i have called you friends because i have made known to you everything that i have heard from my father
334168 paul mccartney evaluated my music while at the liverpool institute for performing arts when i walked into that room and he was sitting there i really did almost have a fit of anxiety i played him a song of mine called carry the weight and at the time i didnt realize there was a beatles song called carry that weight he said i think my band did a song called that and i was like really he made some suggestions and we worked on it a bit and now i have a song that has paul mccartney credited on it i dont think its a kites song though its a lot more singer songwritery
334169 i love the idea of a group of people working really well together but ive just never been in a situation yet where ive felt that i really connect in a band on a musical level it can get very lonely doing it that way but then you dont really have to compromise luckily i have a good group of musical friends that i can bounce stuff off of which often pulls me out of my own ass
334170 im not the biggest fan of your conventional singer songwriter i dont really connect that much with the confessional sort of songwriting where people are talking about the way they feel as if no one has ever felt that way before and expect that to carry a boring arrangement i like it a lot more when people transport you somewhere else with the music and the arrangement and lyrics where every detail seems just as important
334171 its about having a sort of bigger architectural framework that youre working to where each moment is as important as the next and the bigger picture is just as important as the small little subatomic bits
334172 i should clear something up now i didnt spend the whole of three years laboring day after day over this ep it was a broken up process between working and doing other stuff
334173 ive been writing all my life and have made eps and stuff but never actually properly released anything that i did and im always writing stuff anyway but not everything fits together as a first taste of kites i wanted to make the strongest statement i felt i could make at the time and those four songs seemed to fit
334174 i am working on an album i think i have enough material demoed now but id like to involve more people in the recording process this time round i like both extremes of sound the really lean and elegant type of sound and the really full type of sound which is what i went for on this ep maybe in the future ill make some more lean music and then even more bombastic music with a full orchestra in st pauls cathedral who knows the possibilities are endless
334175 ive been working with a couple uk based artists matt robertson and mike reed on their project which is called mood bungalow its pretty exciting and epic stuff every song is in some crazy time signature i did the vocal arrangement and singing on one of their tracks i also might be doing some remixes for other artists ive got a lot of material that i dont think fits into the kites realm that might turn into something else at some point but well see

334183 he is never to take wine or other fermented drink

334185 road america happens to be one of my most favorite circuits the difficulty of elkhart lake is that it is so long in length obvious but a fact the circuits design is one of the most difficult to setup for very long straights with very slow corners that follow very heavy braking periods all things that create high fuel consumption so unless it rains which it always might after all we are in wisconsin or we have lots of caution periods which can always happen i look for a fuel consumption type of race
334186 road america is a great fast track it reminds me a lot of europe it is a little like spa franchorchamps in belgium and this is what i like the biggest challenge is of course to stay out of trouble in the race and to score as many points as possible but also a big challenge is to drive quickly this track is a little like mosport quick and dangerous the quick corners and hard braking zones will require a lot of courage
334187 i learned the track so now i know it but every time you come to a track you have been to you learn new things and secrets about the track
334188 it is a priority to get points a dnf would be very bad for us especially now with the battle between us and the lizards so maximum attack but no risk that is the plan
334189 for sure road america is a very demanding and challenging track with run offs and so on it still has the charm of an american race track and is also very close to our nordschleife i do very much like it i am just very happy that this track is on the calendar the biggest challenge is to stay concentrated for the whole lap because of the length of the track you can loose time easily everywhere
334190 the trick this year will be to stay out of trouble the last races have shown that there are five cars that are fast and this will be the case at road america as well we are on a very good way to improve our self step by step even if it gets harder and harder we will keep improving we get all the support of all our guys michelin and ferrari which makes me really feel good
334191 we as a team are fighting for the title and it is still early in the season so our main target will be to finish the race as high as possible because we need to collect the points i am very much looking forward to the race
334192 road america has everything to offer in a road course in terms of turns straightaways and elevation changes the greatest challenge of road america as a driver is not to bite off more than you can chew last year i had the luxury of driving in the rain which made for a long and dark stint with little visibility i have to say in those conditions i learned quite a bit about patience and attrition
334193 i approach this event more as a sprint race we need to be up front and not take a chance of being split by the lead prototype when a caution comes out
334194 i wish i was back in school just so i could enter this sweepstakes justin hunt driver of the matco tools votech chevy cobalt said
334195 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back

334205 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
334206 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
334207 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back

334219 there are 25 guys down there right now that feel like a team
334220 it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
334221 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we needed to
334222 its an exciting time to stand in front of your players
334223 i had numerous people try to help me with my bags at the airport
334224 im going to try to do what i can do i think im equipped to handle that
334225 i dont think its fair of me to sit here today and look back and comment on why manny was unhappy its a question for manny
334226 he had a remarkable run here hes one of the best right handed hitters in history
334227 if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go
334228 we were having a difficult time and it wasnt any one persons fault
334229 there was doubt there was even exhaustion on the part of some players and a pretty major distraction
334230 manny and i were friends of course im going to miss him
334231 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
334232 tony is such an iconic figure in these sports and thats not going to change
334233 the tony hawk brand still lives in so many ways from the huckjam to the video games to clothing and apparel becoming irrelevant certainly is not a concern of his
334234 we all understand too that it takes money to make things happen we want to take our show out on the road and showcase our talents and the only way to do that is through corporate sponsors and such

334241 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
334242 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
334243 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
334244 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
334245 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
334246 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
334247 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
334248 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
334249 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
334250 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
334251 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
334252 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
334253 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
334254 rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
334255 you can always do better but i thought our guys came out with a good attitude enthusiasm effort and good retention we are going to have to make sure we are on the right path to victory all the intangibles are there we just have to put the basics in place which is defense hustling to the ball sure handed tackles when we get the pads on and protecting the ball on offense
334256 it tests your mental toughness a little bit we assume our guys are tough we really do we dont look at a guy and say oh hes not tough because hes not working at the speed we want we are under the consideration that we need to be careful with them because with the heat that the health of our student athletes is one thing we always monitor out here we expect our guys to be tough and we expect them to play hard and if they start to get winded or light headed we will stop and get them water
334257 right now it looks like receiver kendall wright and quarterback robert griffin are going to play i would be surprised if that did not work out for them and i would be surprised if there werent some others before its all said and done
334258 am i being neurotic or is it really not safe
334259 it just gets compounded because everything is plastic and made in china you end up worrying about lead paint plastics all these things our parents never worried about
334260 in the past six months i started freaking out about the bpa stuff and plastic toys
334261 in target ill ask other moms shopping in the same aisles what they think about a toy
334262 its really hard as a mom to know what to do
334263 as consumers were buying whats out there and you just trust the companies especially when it comes to things designed especially for babies that theyre safe
334264 our goal is to reach out personally to every family affected by this incident and to assist as necessary while the boys recover
334265 it looks a lot like a boy scout camp down there
334266 you could tell people were surprised and somewhat shook up
334267 there have been other instances where people open the holding container to liberate the mosquitoes
334268 its like the free willy movie you know liberate the mosquitoes
334269 its one of these things where youre trying to do something for the public good and you have it interrupted by vandalism it doesnt make a lot of sense
334270 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

334432 the outlook for singapore residential prices will probably be very flat
334433 the mass market take up rate is still very good and for the mid range tier the prices are holding out well but people will not be buying aggressively for the high end sector now
334434 if you observe the high end buyers they are not buying for investment purposes but as a second or third property in asia
334435 for the high end property the prices will still hover around 3 000 per square foot

334458 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
334459 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
334460 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
334461 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
334462 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
334463 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
334464 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
334465 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

334476 the first couple of games i had butterflies in my stomach and now its pretty comfortable
334477 i feel like its kind of like riding a bike
334478 the biggest thing for him is stretching his arm out and also stretching his legs out to make him more mobile hes worked his tail off i think the next phase will be stretching his arm out and getting a little more length in his arm but for the most part hes done a pretty good job out there
334479 i think the hardest thing for me is definitely the arm strength just because ive been throwing like a first baseman for three years
334480 to make a play like this the deciding play in a game knowing that hes going to be out there and im not going to double switch for him that all plays into his confidence
334481 the one thing he hasnt really been challenged this year so far is a play like that
334482 that would be a huge hassle for everybody im very relieved its over
334483 we kind of talked about it that day wednesday i asked if anything was in the works and he said he hadnt heard anything
334484 i thought he was lying to me like he always does
334485 i dont know where it came about it became a habit
334486 itll obviously be different but it wont be life threatening
334487 ive played without him before its like one of your buddies from a selfish personal standpoint its going to be tough
334488 well do with 24 tonight really just trying to toss it around a little bit with two or three possible choices
334489 and with what r a dickey did for us last night we really feel that weve got a real full bullpen tonight so tonights not the issue so much but well have somebody here on saturday
334490 hes doing everything weve asked hes done well i dont know that itll be next week or whatever but i think well see him in the near future
334491 as soon as i got suspended i called my agent first thing in the morning and appealed right away
334492 i think everybody knows except the umpire that when the ball hit a rod i didnt try to hit him but there are a lot of people in that ballpark maybe he got a little nervous i dont know and he agreed to do it what can i do just wait and see what happens
334493 it was a surprise i didnt think id ever get suspended for that but they did
334494 now ill appeal and wait and see what happens they work for baseball they do what they think i just play ill wait and see what happens
334495 he told me that the rule from the commissioners office and bob watson handles those things is when someone gets ejected from the game for intentionally throwing at a hitter there is a suspension that goes along with that
334496 when you get thrown out you automatically are going to get suspended so thats part of the penalty
334497 i think its great for the dodgers considering their offense
334498 mannys not a bad guy he will do things and stuff that sometimes certain people are going to react to and i think guys just had enough of it i dont know whats going on because obviously i wasnt over there but it had to be something to get manny ramirez out of your lineup
334499 theyre capable of still being good because they were good without big papi but does it make them better no thats the best 3 4 tandem that youve had to face in the big leagues for years now does that mean that jason bay cant fill that void of course not jason bays a great player but nobodys manny ramirez
334500 he played a few great years in cleveland a few great years in boston and now hes moving on to the next chapter in his life and theyre getting a great hitter we know that
334501 boston is never going to be less intimidating theyre the defending world champions
334502 it just lets you know that anything in this game is possible its a big move for the dodgers they just got a whole lot more offense in their lineup
334503 the only thing i can go on is that when big papi was out for five weeks it had to be a better feeling for a pitcher to only have to face one of them
334504 you have mike lowell you have dustin pedroia you have kevin youkilis but with manny and ortiz youre looking at 80 home runs between two guys

334549 a quiet morning turns into a explosion of muscle when it involves young muscle god abomb
334550 ever since i turned 35 the battle of the bulge has turned into a rout gut 1 patrick 0
334551 the syndrome is associated with eight degenerative diseases the first is overweight disorder then high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar then you have type two diabetes cardiovascular diseases heart attacks and strokes four kinds of cancer breast prostate colon endometrial osteoarthritis and finally gall bladder disease all this is basically because people eat too many carbohydrates thats partly because its the cheapest food and also because the food industry keeps throwing sugar into everything to make it taste good
334552 healthy cells contain proteins that span the entire charge spectrum from negatively charged proteins to positively charged protein health means that theres a balance between negatively charged proteins and positively charged proteins this is essential for core body health because the 25 000 proteins in the body are its worker bees
334553 the synthesis of negatively charged proteins continues but the synthesis of positively charged proteins is greatly diminished and this impairs cell function causing further disease all foods made in bulk in nature contain negatively charged proteins things like whey soy casein and egg white and when we get meat at the store its usually muscle which is also mainly negatively charged proteins
334554 unless of course you eat like your grandparents did tripe kidney or stomach you get much more of a protein balance from organ meat but people dont eat all that much of it anymore
334555 you could make up for a positively charged protein deficiency by eating protein with an overall negative charge
334556 eleven are nonessential meaning our body makes them and nine are essential meaning our body doesnt make them and we must get them from our diets as we age there are two things that prevent us from getting those essential amino acids we fall into poor eating habits taking in lots of carbohydrates and less protein rich food and also the aging process interferes with the digestive process leading to further deficiencies in amino acids and positively charged proteins i call this the food chain gap
334557 by the end of the first week you have more pep and energy
334558 reset the metabolic pathways and thats why you get more pep and energy plus it burns calories they can even improve mood three of those amino acids are direct precursors to neurotransmitters in the brain two of them are dopamine and serotonin which are related to pleasure this means they can also relieve stress anxiety mood swings and depression because they reach the brain within minutes the amino acids also signal the brains appetite centers that the body is well fed and that leads to feelings of comfort satisfaction and well being
334559 i used to get three viruses a year but ive been using factor4 weight control for two and a half years and i dont get sick anymore

334587 so really then even though your favorite experience is dancing your core value is fun and excitement and the way you feel those emotions in your body so whats most important to you is the experience of fun and excitement and whatever leads you to that is most important blah blah
334588 ok so in four minutes weve fulfilled your quest for core value you can the now

334608 the announcement is a huge success for americas nursing homes and the millions of people they serve
334609 this decision illustrates cms commitment to target public dollars towards needed patient care
334610 the bottom line news from todays announcement is that medicare beneficiaries are deservedly the big winners and will continue to benefit from ready access to the high quality post acute care they need and deserve
334611 from a policy standpoint this is an outstanding development in terms of both meeting seniors changing health care needs and doing so in a manner that uses medicare funds efficiently

334623 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
334624 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
334625 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
334626 apakah saya kecewa dengan tindakannya tidak sama sekali saya melihat dia sangat serius dan fokus dia sangat ingin meninggalkan chelsea saya yakin soal itu meski itu menciptakan banyak kegelisahan buatnya dan faktanya dia bertahan karena alasan keluarga

334628 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
334629 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
334630 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
334631 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
334632 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
334633 i was a little bit tired especially after a tough win in toronto last week and the weather here is very humid and hot but it is important to be in the semi finals

334635 but for sure number one is a goal and i am very happy

334639 monday morning he picked up his newspapers and that was it he picked up his newspapers and fell off the face of the earth
334640 she basically just said that she didnt know where he was and that he had told her hed left out of town on an emergency
334641 it was just a total shock i would have never thought this would ever happen
334642 there was nothing to believe or suggest that he would have it in him to do something like this
334643 the deadline passed and i thought wow all that and nothing
334644 and then a half hour after the deadline passed i get called into the managers office and they say youve been traded if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to than boston i dont think
334645 its tough to all of a sudden have it click that youve been submersed in the middle of a pennant race and you have a chance to win a ring i dont think its going to resonate that quick i think that i might need a day or two to let it sink in but i fully intend to let it sink in
334646 i just thought of it as they need a left fielder regardless of what happened before i got here im going to play left field here and i cant wait
334647 hes going to hit for a pretty good average and hes going to play great defence for you hes going to be a fun player to watch
334648 if youre going to replace manny ramirez youre not going to replace his stats
334649 if youre going to replace him youre hoping to get a good teammate and thats what we got
334650 i saw him be banged up in 06 thinking no way is he playing tonight he played every night he never talked about anything if his knee was bothering him he just went out there and played and never made an excuse for anything thats the bottom line this guy is a gamer
334651 when i saw it i actually thought it was a joke quite honestly
334652 i know she is going to sell a lot more tickets than i will but i would say its surprising i dont think its a real popular decision out here
334653 the only thing i can control is myself a good score will resolve everything
334654 shes a great player and she will make the cut in a pga tour event
334655 mediocre people are jealous of the money shes making and the life she has
334656 you could pick 20 guys in reno who have missed 11 of the last 12 cuts the players dont want to understand shes part of the reason theyre playing for so much money theres no reason people should be so cruel to her

334676 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
334677 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech

334681 um since you said wed be having it i thought you had already found some no creamed spinach then
334682 uh no good thing you bought those baking potatoes along with the steaks the other day
334683 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
334684 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
334685 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
334686 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
334687 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
334688 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
334689 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

334697 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas for mccains sake this tomfoolery needs to stop

334700 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
334701 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation

334725 wynn i think i want to start a blog in addition to writing and speaking i want to be a positive influence in the world of hunting my dad passed a lot to me and i want hunting to be a viable option for our children
334726 oh you hunt thanks for protecting our lands and animals
334727 to enable children to live well with diabetes through enjoyable camp experience
334728 well you could say so its all gone within 12 hours there were a ton of goldfinches munching away
334729 wow wait until the others here about this it will be an afternoon fiesta
334730 yo mom dad brothers sisters cousins friends enemies follow me for a tasty treat
334731 are you nuts why did you write on your cards
334732 the first ones a spike when you see antlers take him
334733 hold off for the bigger and better rewards of not using it
334734 this is exactly what they needed and i think itll certainly help them
334735 theyre not out of the woods just yet but they did a great job rounding up financing and thats positive for fliers
334736 we told our clients that we didnt think frontier would make it unless they found financing or merged with someone else
334737 my first response was whew we cant say yet that everything is fine and dandy but we tell customers that were cautiously optimistic
334738 i guess it really doesnt matter to me if im booking a flight thats only a couple of weeks away
334739 but i dont think ill book them for any travel thats far out thats a couple months away
334740 the financing deal was obviously a lifeline that frontier desperately needed and i think management should be congratulated in finding an investor in what i thought were impossible economic conditions
334741 but if theres any concern about an airlines economic viability consumers with a lot of frequent flier miles should draw down that balance rather than buy tickets and they should always use a credit card so they can get their money back
334742 their bankruptcy hasnt weighed into my decision to fly them at all i love frontier with everything else going on with the airlines you could fly someone else and they could cancel your flight and you could get stuck anyway
334743 ive been sweating bullets but it looks like it turned out fine i never really considered switching to another airline i always felt that frontier is pretty respectable that they treat their passengers well so if something did happen i think they would try to accommodate us as best as they could
334744 i wasnt too concerned about their bankruptcy but when i heard that an investment firm had to bail them out i realized the situation was more serious than i had thought ill probably be a little cautious when considering whether to book with them now
334745 he is returning from a holiday he has had leave peter costello and i meet regularly to discuss a whole variety of things
334746 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
334747 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the front bench
334748 but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time
334749 i think he could have walked out and not turned around and shot wally its that simple
334750 he should have taken the money and left but hes made a huge hole in the family
334751 do you have love for others and a desire to serve or are you only concerned with your own needs

334765 we think it will be neat summiting for someone else rather than just summiting for ourselves
334766 what were doing is pretty routine compared to what gage goes through
334767 and were thankful for good friends like mason and chris and the others who decided i dont want to just climb for myself i want to climb in honor of someone who cant climb it on their own but who are climbing their own mountains

334804 imho having the bios activate the fans sooner to compensate for a defective chipset is a band aid solution
334805 well since this bios update wont mysteriously change the die packaging material the only real thing you can do is to extent warranty or premium support to the amount of years you wanna use the computer and still then live with the fact that your computer could die on you any time
334806 so rather than replacing the faulty parts you are going to just turn up the fans at the expense of battery life and noise i would rather just leave the bios as it is and get a proper fix if the problem occurs even if the problem occurs out of warranty i think there is a strong case for dell fixing it for free since there is an admitted manufacturing defect
334807 with this solution you try to push the issue outside the customers warranty time but whats after that time will you repair the notebooks for free
334808 nice to see that a hardware issue is fixed by software update how is a physical defect suppose to be fixed by software time to step up to the plate dell and start offering a replacement device
334809 i tend to agree with some of the other comments a bios update to turn on cooling fans is not the appropriate response when i have spent approx 2000 on an xps that i now fear will have a shortened life span

334874 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
334875 la relaci n entre los medios de comunicaci n y el estado siempre ha sido una relaci n de tensi n lo importante es saber que la censura no solo existe cuando se dictan medidas donde se proh ba a alg n medio publicar algo
334876 hay muchas tipos de censura sobre todo en los pa ses donde las organizaciones delincuenciales han traspasado las fronteras censura tambi n es el asesinato de un periodista y el estado tiene la responsabilidad de prevenir e investigar ese tipo de casos
334877 lo bonito de ese caso fue que los medios mandaron a su mejor gente sus unidades investigativas los periodistas m s tesos para que miraran lo que estaba pasando en manizales
334878 que la gente pueda conocer esa informaci n salvo en muy pocos casos de extrem sima seguridad permite un mejor control ciudadano
334879 aunque suene parad jico el estado debe garantizar que hayan medios de oposici n que sus cr ticos tengan la oportunidad de decir de desahogarse de expresarse y debe garantizar el estado que tambi n hayan medios alternativos
334880 o elenco est focado em ir para o s o caetano e conseguir os tr s pontos para o paran subir na classifica o espero que a equipe coloque em pr tica o que foi desenvolvido nos treinamentos durante a semana

334884 rab ne will be the biggest hit of 2008 it comes to number 42 just like did and that number vibrates with both yash chopra who is a number 9 and aditya chopra who is a number 3 the movie will do unheard of business and might even break records
334885 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
334886 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore

334889 i am interested only in the thought that there might be aspects of human nature that we do in fact value without being able to prove that we should my goal will be to show that considering emotions integral to moral judgments is philosophically respectable
334890 is not that morality is silly or unimportant but only that logic and empirical investigation alone cannot generate moral judgments in effect morality is itself for hume a matter of human nature
334891 they want to go kayaking and they want to go biking they want different activities
334892 we felt like the real life drama of their lives overshadowed anything happening on the show
334893 viewers would see paris all day long on the news about her going to jail so they didnt care about seeing her camping with kids it just was too played out
334894 paris carried the show she was the one willing to do anything
334895 we are comfortable that we have the legal right to distribute this video
334896 she will be taking legal action against anyone responsible for this she was unaware of this and caught completely off guard
334897 for the sake of your children and the animals who are at risk while in ms spears custody we hope that you will do the right and best thing for all involved and pursue a custody order for the animals so that your sons can continue to have the company of the animals theyve grown to adore
334898 he was and is extremely embarrassed by how the hilton name has been sullied by paris he now doesnt want to leave unearned wealth to his family
334899 i cant get in trouble im a celebrity i can do whatever the fuck i want
334900 im a celebrity im not going to get in trouble

334902 it was announced today that the wedding ceremony for usher raymond iv and tameka foster was canceled no additional information will be given regarding the circumstances of the cancellation but we hope the privacy of this matter will be respected
334903 alli gave specific instances where brit couldnt handle having the kids kevin was angry at britney for putting his kids in jeopardy and immediately phoned his lawyer to investigate the claims further he couldnt believe she had gotten so out of control
334904 both wanted kids and decided this was a good time

334906 if youre interested in what nicole has to say tune into
334907 everything in my life came to a point where i had to make a decision
334908 she thinks its so funny that everybodys worried about her
334909 she says oh what a pitiful girl they must all be saying and then she breaks into hysterics
334910 and she doesnt like britney taking away all the attention either
334911 she had a problem with the extras being about when she did the pole dance
334912 she was shy or embarrassed or something and she really started struggling with the whole thing
334913 you could see she was getting a bit wobbly but no one expected her to throw a complete fit suddenly she was in floods of tears and stormed off set she eventually came back but was sobbing hysterically
334914 all her make up had run by now it was nearly midnight and the director just called things to an end and sent people home it was a total shambles
334915 she is a mess britneys out of control and acting like a spoilt brat it was embarrassing she needs help fast
334916 she just didnt want to cooperate and was snotty and rude to everyone behaving like a complete and utter spoilt brat
334917 they say britney completely lost it crying and clutching her dog london
334918 she didnt eat or drink anything other than can after can of red bull she could have drank 20 of them all told
334919 suddenly she was in floods of tears and stormed off set she eventually came back but was sobbing hysterically all her make up had run by now it was nearly midnight and the director just called things to an end and sent people home
334920 nike has suspended michael vicks contract without pay and will not sell any more michael vick product at nike owned retail at this time
334921 while we respect the legal process we find the allegations against mr vick too disturbing to ignore therefore we have decided to immediately suspend selling vick nfl product both at retail and online through the reebok website
334922 americans love football but they love dogs more and want nothing to do with wearing a name thats become synonymous with cruelty to animals we commend nike for this decision this is a victory for all dogs beaten and killed in illegal dogfighting rings around the country
334923 we are going to manage britney were gonna take good care of her britney if youre listening were here for you
334924 what a joke they help me i invented what they do
334925 it makes you wonder what lohan was thinking when she said yes to this project you want to know who killed her shes doing it to herself
334926 the truth is no review could really do justice to the monumental trashiness of this mess it really has to be seen to be believed although if lohan is lucky no one will bother
334927 shes very talented shed be great a as a playboy bunny
334928 at one point we helped him put a dollar in the vending machine
334929 the idea is that everybody is buying up organs and they cannot afford to pay for these organs
334930 thus legalized organ repo men come into the picture murder becomes sanctioned by law so if you buy a heart and cant afford it someone can burst through the door and take your heart out and they dont get in trouble for it
334931 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats and he will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then the king will say to those on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me then the righteous will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink when did we see you a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you or when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you and the king will answer and say to them assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me then he will also say to those on the left hand depart from me you cursed into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you did not take me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me then they also will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you then he will answer them saying assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me and these will go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into eternal life
334932 lord jesus christ you satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts
334933 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats and he will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then the king will say to those on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me then the righteous will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink when did we see you a stranger and take you in or naked and clothe you or when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you and the king will answer and say to them assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me then he will also say to those on the left hand depart from me you cursed into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me no food i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you did not take me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me then they also will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you then he will answer them saying assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me and these will go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into eternal life
334934 estoy con muchas ganas entregado completamente al equipo y primero dios el ma ana espero tener una oportunidad de gol para meterla necaxa es un cuadro que tiene ya varios torneos con la misma base y a buenos jugadores no s si tengan alguna debilidad pero apostaremos por el juego a reo para vencerlos
334935 ll veselos jefe porque ya no hay nada en taquilla al rato ni nosotros vamos a traer
334936 as es salvador caba as es un ejemplo yo lo conozco l jugaba en un club bajo all en paraguay y vino medio ca do y ahora viste se levant y es un referente paraguayo para nosotros
334937 no platiqu con l y ojala se de pronto para poder hablar con l pienso que hay que sacar que l trabaja y es humilde y con la humildad siempre hay que salir adelante que es un factor muy importante
334938 andr s es un futbolista muy completo que nos puede dar un relevo perfectamente por las bandas yo lo quiero m s arriba
334939 omar bravo trabaja much simo da muchos apoyos y siempre est pendiente de la salida del bal n y despu s en el rea es un gran rematador
334940 no estoy en contra de l pero s me gustar a que fueran m s mexicanos no que cada vez vayan apareciendo m s naturalizados y puedan estar en la selecci n m s de dos o m s de tres
334941 creo que eso ser a preocupante para nosotros saber que dentro de un pa s de m s de cien millones de mexicanos pueda haber un jugador de m s calidad de ellos
334942 no se trata de si son mejores o no es cuesti n de apreciaci n y de gustos del t cnico en una selecci n siempre va a ser lo mismo van y vienen los t cnicos y siempre hay una base
334943 hay muy buenos contenciones en m xico que est n jugando en m xico y que est n fuera de m xico no es nada definitivo que l pueda estar dentro del proceso simplemente es para conocerlos y se ir dando una idea de lo que pueda pasar y que jugadores puede contar
334944 no digo que no sea tan necesario obviamente necesita verlo platicar con l y sentirlo y cu ndo se va a dar uno cuenta en los partidos oficiales ojal funcione que le vaya bien l y si le va bien a l nos va a ir bien a todos porque la selecci n es de todos

334947 y si en un momento piensa que le hago falta ah estar no tengo porque pensar de otra manera
334948 if he is thinking that by so doing contesting in the by election the police would stop investigating then this is not right we must remember that the complainant mohd saiful bukhari azlan has lodged a report and what he is looking for is justice
334949 we must not forget him the police will continue their investigations based on the rule of law we must carry out our responsibility so that mohd saifuls claims are brought to court for a decision to be made in the name of justice
334950 in this country everyone is entitled to justice based on the rule of law
334951 then as soon as you get your archery permit come back and see me
334952 i had to be here in ottawa for an oil change in my jeep at sierra motors
334953 este unul dintre materialele de senzatie ale deceniului brad si angelina reprezinta cuplul de vis pentru revistele din intreaga lume si ne asteptam la o triplare a vanzarilor datorita fascinatiei si interesului publicului fata de acest cuplu si de copiii lor
334954 doamna taylor este bine zvonurile care au aparut in anglia despre starea ei de sanatate sunt dramatice exagerate si false vizita ei la spital este doar o precautie se va intoarce acasa in scurt timp in prezent este incojurata de familie prieteni si bijuterii minunate
334955 the kipunji is hanging on by the thinnest of threads
334956 we must do all we can to safeguard this extremely rare and little understood species while there is still time
334957 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
334958 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
334959 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
334960 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out
334961 tb bacteria have access to an abundant supply of iron citrate flowing through the lungs in the blood
334962 finding a way to sneak iron from humans at no energy cost to the bacteria is as good as it gets our discovery may enable others to figure out a way to limit tbs access to iron citrate making the bacteria more vulnerable to drug treatment
334963 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
334964 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
334965 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
334966 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
334967 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
334968 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
334969 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
334970 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
334971 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
334972 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
334973 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects
334974 this car doesnt have a carbon footprint more of a crater

335004 my bet is that microsoft will flat out buy some of the companies during their year of incubation

335024 i call my artistic style contemporary renaissance because at this point if you look at the paintings theyre very reminiscent of old classics and classical realism but the subject matter is contemporary very modern
335025 stylistically speaking i am picking up where i left off in college i started the toy soldier motif then to give value to common objects i was trying to take mundane objects and shower them with pomp and circumstance
335026 i think the reason this collection fits is because michael has combined familiar but very different things like oil paints and toy soldiers we enjoy exposing our guests to unique flavors now they can be exposed to a new art collection every month

335053 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible

335075 we tried but espn wouldnt listen to anything we said so they went ahead to have a bmx ramp builder design and build the thing
335076 it just doesnt work for skateboarding and i hear the bmxers arent too happy about it either
335077 i think what we wanted to build was too much money and they saw how bad the contest went last year because of the format and they felt like they didnt want to blow their wad on something like that
335078 its built like expletive basically the guy that built it needs to be fired
335079 we have some say but this year they kinda stuck it to us
335080 it is a little small and the transitions are a little tight
335081 i think with anything its in its first year you can tell that im hoping that it goes well and they make really amazing changes for next year
335082 im going to go with no comment with that one
335083 came the reply they also attribute the lack of sony support in fixing bugs to the cancellation playstation only bugs are so complicated and sony didnt have the support to help us out during the saints row 1 development

335116 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
335117 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
335118 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
335119 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american

335124 inside the boardrooms at the major oil companies its christmas in july
335125 whats shocking is that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production or investing in alternative energy
335126 insult to the american people and to the system of checks and balances that are the basis of our constitution and our democracy
335127 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
335128 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
335129 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
335130 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
335131 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
335132 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
335133 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
335134 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
335135 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
335136 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
335137 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
335138 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks
335139 in my mind the idea of a giant congestion crisis strikes me as fear mongering
335140 it is certainly true that there is great demand for bandwidth and firms will have to build more capacity if they want to meet demand and or begin pricing differently but im not certain it reflects the reality that most internet users are experiencing

335144 the americans have all along known about the isis collaboration with the taliban they knew the political leadership of the taliban including mullah omar were in quetta they knew when jalaluddin haqqani was in pakistan earlier it didnt suit their interest to admit this but now that the fellows trained to fight in kashmir are fighting in afghanistan and killing american soldiers theyre feeling the heat
335145 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead
335146 of his own volition he suggested adding an hour to the questioning the questions were to the point
335147 relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
335148 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
335149 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
335150 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
335151 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
335152 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
335153 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
335154 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
335155 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
335156 well youre so dumb it took you three hours to watch 60 minutes

335186 weve already decided to but we just havent decided why yet
335187 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
335188 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
335189 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
335190 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
335191 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
335192 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
335193 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
335194 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
335195 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
335196 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
335197 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
335198 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
335199 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
335200 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
335201 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
335202 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
335203 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
335204 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
335205 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one

335256 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
335257 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
335258 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
335259 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off

335300 yah now the memos need to be in times new roman font and the cover sheets in arial why do we change these standards every few months

335302 cuando est bamos abriendo el muro para dar acceso a la nueva obra del edificio colindante nos quedamos estupefactos aparecieron varios esqueletos de ni os reci n nacidos junto al de un adulto lo curioso es que antes de introducir los taladros yo advert que hab a ladrillos que no pertenec an a la construcci n original los originales hab an sido sustituidos por otros que a mi parecer databan de primeros de siglo
335303 mientras esper bamos pudimos ver con toda claridad una serie de reflejos de destellos muy llamativos como si alguien estuviera haciendo efectos especiales eran como haces de luz de distintos colores que se mov an lentamente en una direcci n inconcreta se pod an ver esas luces en diferentes lugares pudimos verlos juan burgos y yo mismo
335304 en un momento dado nos pareci ver una cierta figura pase ndose por esa habitaci n no se le apreciaba contornos bien definidos parec a tener rostro e incluso llevar un sombrero pero tampoco puedo asegurar que fuera as lo que si recuerdo es que era bastante oscura
335305 fuimos todos para arriba yo vi luces que iban y ven an pens que se trataba de las luces de los coches de la calle pero era imposible porque no hay ventanas tenia una pitillera a mis espaldas que salio volando por los aires y fue haciendo zigzag hasta que le dio en la cara a nuestro compa ero juan burgos
335306 ya varios metros antes de llegar al lugar el medidor empez a detectar alteraciones se disparo la se al ac stica y el indicador magn tico enloqueci a menos de dos metros del muro algo impresionante sucedi un inesperado alco voltaico salio de la pared impactando contra el medidor de tal forma que lo arranco de mis manos no se aun si por el sobresalto que experimente yo o por la acci n del propio rayo el aparato cayo al suelo quedando aparentemente roto recobrando el aliento y la serenidad intente proseguir la mediaci n cuando un dolor agudo en el ngulo que forman los dedos ndice y pulgar me obligo a soltar el aparato que esta vez si quedo roto en el suelo miraba asombrado las se ales punzantes que hab an quedado en mi mano cuando algo m s incre ble sucedi de la obertura del muro salio un chorro de espeso humo como si algo se estuviera quemando dentro el humo se fue levantando formando una fumarola una columna compacta un monolito en la parte superior de la columna se fue configurando una especie de rostro esculpido en piedra que miraba hacia nosotros se trataba de un ser con aspecto de hombre de unos cuarenta y cinco a os de edad con pelo canoso ojos peque os y hundidos con nariz recta y labios finos la distancia existente entre la nariz y el labio superior de la boca era mayor de lo habitual la fisonom a daba al rostro una expresi n de tristeza aunque la imagen en general era plana

335309 i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
335310 those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer
335311 any result like this is always difficult for family members because it re opens all the old wounds
335312 and that line drawn underneath what happened has now disappeared and there is the prospect of at least a review if not a re investigation into the case
335313 a huge thank you to the jury they obviously worked very hard to ensure they correctly interpreted the circumstantial evidence in this case
335314 we hope that the police will now look again into the murder of jill dando
335315 the only reason that the prosecution say that this is the work of the local loner the local nutter the man with these serious psychological problems is because that is the man they arrested

335318 cnn has mixed in footage of riots that took place in budapest hungary with that of the riots in belgrade
335319 some comments on the web seem to hint that perhaps cnn were deliberately trying to make the protests seem more violent than they actually were i dont really believe that but still how does somebody accidentally edit in footage from an entirely different country and which was filmed over one year ago
335320 cnn has mixed in footage of riots that took place in budapest hungary with that of the riots in belgrade
335321 some comments on the web seem to hint that perhaps cnn were deliberately trying to make the protests seem more violent than they actually were i dont really believe that but still how does somebody accidentally edit in footage from an entirely different country and which was filmed over one year ago
335322 i hope that peoples eyes will be opened now that they will know we were not to blame but that there are people who had preconceived plans to exterminate certain population groups
335323 we are working through it internally and will let you know when we have an update
335324 steve was probably a little remorseful for what happened and was trying to apologize
335325 i think any time something like that happens you are disappointed
335326 im not going to deal with this in the media
335327 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what are the repercussions for this event
335328 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here
335329 the focus is not where it needs to be right now which is training to play this 2008 season im hoping we all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us and come together and focus on the season focus on winning games and keep the big picture in mind because were all here to try to win a super bowl
335330 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
335331 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
335332 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
335333 we dont know what is going to happen but this team cant stop this team has to keep going on there was not another skirmish both sides collected themselves and finished off practice in a positive way
335334 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
335335 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
335336 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
335337 received information that suggests the other driver may have been travelling upwards of 50 miles an hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
335338 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
335339 i teased and ridiculed at school i had stones thrown at me and was spat upon
335340 intellectually i understood i was not responsible for the atrocities but emotionally i could not shake the shame for the horror my native country had participated in in order to be internally reconciled i somehow needed to be in the presence of the tortured souls of the past to offer my own hurting soul in order to cleanse and restore myself
335341 my people have suffered more than yours therefore i am entitled to make you suffer too
335342 thieves are beating us to a lot of our grease were showing up and theyre empty
335343 im afraid im going to show up at one of my restaurants and theres going to be cement in my barrels

335345 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
335346 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
335347 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him
335348 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
335349 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
335350 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
335351 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
335352 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
335353 just where exactly can i lay up my treasures on earth
335354 if youve already helped god to realize his will in your life through abundant wealth why not do what jesus suggests and properly protect your wealth from the harsh elements of the earth
335355 the bible says that wealth is stored up for the righteous prov 13 22
335356 youve seized the wealth and riches that have come your way so take the practical steps to store them up as the bible says protect your treasures from satans three biggest weapons against your righteous treasures protect yourself against the moth the rust and the thief buy your treasure shed today

335375 what i realize with the hip hop market they dont try to change their formula
335376 the only thing thats different is new equipment so youre getting new sounds but the groove is still the same so theyre able to flow and keep that level of music for the people thats what i try to do with dancehall keep that formula that drew people from other countries to our music i try to change the sound a little bit and you done know its a bit more lyrical but i still try to keep it simple and as bare knuckle as possible thats the real hardcore dancehall and it works cause all of my riddims still play in parties where others fade away

335428 we hope he will tackle pressing policy issues head on and show bold leadership when implementing policy
335429 the prime minister is standing on an extremely severe position

335434 we hope administration efforts working with the congress will help our fellow citizens close a painful chapter in their lives
335435 the united states also looks forward to expanding its relationship with libya and its people as we resolve contentious issues from the past
335436 decision by congress provides a powerful incentive now to libya to proceed
335437 its agreed in principle how its going to happen so that should take place pretty quickly ideally
335438 and we are sufficiently reassured that there will be enough funding to satisfy our claimants
335439 the numbers that have been thrown out in the press are not inaccurate it is a very substantial sum of money
335440 i think that if we do this arrangement those matters will go away and we will be able to move ahead in normalizing
335441 this deal would obviously allow a visit by the secretary of state
335442 but the fall is available and well look to see what might be appropriate then

335453 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
335454 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
335455 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
335456 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

335460 indie artists produced and off the icp went to define the
335461 we have discovered a part of hiv a small region on the surface of hiv that is mostly unchangeable
335462 the reason that is unchangeable is that the virus must keep it constant so that it can attach itself to cells
335463 we have a way of attacking this part of the virus using molecules called catalytic antibodies or abzymes
335464 these are antibodies with enzymatic activity they can catalyze the breakdown of thousands of virus particles per molecule of the antibody
335465 that is the eventual goal to develop a preparation that can induce immunity to the virus over the entire life span
335466 current medicines are quite expensive they run in thousands of dollars per year and our antibodies could be used in small amounts and therefore the cost of goods would be smaller
335467 saya ini sedang membantu rakyat miskin kalo anda tidak setuju dengan program blt berarti anda tidak setuju saya menyantuni rakyat miskin
335468 kalau bantuan ini diberikan kepada rakyat miskin yang memerlukan apa etis seorang bupati menolak itu
335469 yang nomor satu adalah kita sebagai aparatur pemerintah harus satu kalau rakyat ini yang membutuhkan akan diberikan bantuan oleh pemerintah kenapa kita tolak tidak etis itu

335478 it was decided we would hold a fundraiser so we could send more guitars to his unit and we just never quit
335479 it costs an average of 15 to 30 to ship an instrument

335482 mark on the graph where your feelings about this movie are
335483 e3 this year in my opinion it was pretty much disappointing to everybody
335484 the press were disappointed the people i talked to in the industry are disappointed almost everyone agree that that was the wrong way to do it
335485 i think we struck a balance of being vendor supported and still being in touch with the gamers
335486 we had over 6 000 hours of volunteer time thats like the polar opposite of e3 which is all about business
335487 i think nearly every company has learned that if they want to stand out from the crowd that its best not to announce things at the same time that everybody else is
335488 in fact id software only officially showed up at e3 as a single announcement during the electronic arts press conference
335489 john is pretty disappointed we didnt have the manpower and resources to have a game for the launch of the
335490 it appears that at this point that given the size of our team we can only work on one mobile game at a time we are probably partner up and the first iphone game will be one where we work with a publishing partner
335491 but its too early to say if thats going to happen at this point
335492 the iphone is cool and the n gage was a nerd device
335493 the iphone is a pretty damn awesome phone its a great business device its one of the best portable mp3 player you can buy it can play videos theres a lot of reasons to have that device and it has the power to play games as well its a cool device that you can play games on and they can be awesome games
335494 going to be competing with all of those other things you can do on the iphone that are pretty cool thats the challenge
335495 it does raise the bar on what you need to do from a game standpoint
335496 no dont port a mobile phone game to iphone write it for iphone from the start
335497 the iphoine sic is cool and the n gage was a nerd device
335498 welcome war resisters former u s president john f kennedy once said war will exist until that distant day when the co conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today a majority of canadian mps understand this and voted on june 3 to allow u s soldiers who object to the war on terror on conscientious grounds to stay in canada however the conservative government is ignoring the will of these deserters to be deported to face punishment in the u s

335508 hes a lot more optimistic than me i can tell you
335509 but we all know you dont have a snow balls chance in hell of getting elected
335510 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
335511 this whole nation needs to be turned around were not going to do it with the democrats saying well get around to it someday
335512 nader filed paperwork putting himself on the ballot in utah
335513 this country is not owned by the two major parties they dont own the voters there is not even the word party in the constitution there isnt even the word corporation in the constitution and yet these two institutions have run our country into the ground and are tearing the heart and soul out of america
335514 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollars bills
335515 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
335516 mccain never said anything about obamas patriotism or his name and he certainly never said anything about race yet the obots actually have defended this rhetoric they applaud their candidate for running against a hallucinated line of attack
335517 barack has played the race card non stop throughout his run as an african american i know what the bi racial blunders doing hes trying to egg up support from the african american community hes trying to turn us into his street team his okey doke and all of that other bull was an attempt back in the primaries it is the only card he has left to play and its not going to play in a general election
335518 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
335519 from the creators of mass effect and star wars knights of the old republic
335520 perhaps sega has finally found the key to making a good sonic game letting someone else do it
335521 well we can just put it right back in there
335522 slapping a ghost around a room while fun and even necessary before trapping really cuts into profits after you pay for the damages
335523 personally id like to do another doom movie i thought working with it was a blast
335524 there are some lessons we learned the best way to do things better is to get the experience
335525 well see what happens when we get further along in development of the new doom game and theres more buzz and we share more about what the game will be about
335526 adam good luck trying to sleep bwa ha ha ha
335527 the characters also seem a bit more realistic to me as opposed to the slightly more exaggerated characters of the past two games
335528 seriously the vader of the original trilogy would have force choked the prequel version of himself until his legs stopped twitching
335529 why would they change that when its not for the better
335530 if its going to last at least twice as long
335531 does the operating profit mean that the company is no longer losing money on the xbox 360 hardware
335532 what i can confirm for you is were making really good progress on that cost curve
335533 strong xbox 360 consoles drove revenue way up and profits way down
335534 on the revenue side we sold more xboxes so we had more cogs that is good news we do not make any money from those but overall in terms of long term health of the business the more consoles we sell the better
335535 i believe microsoft has been making a profit on the 360 for some time now outside of rrod
335536 do this today and you got second place in this generations console war
335537 the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act passed this week makes it an unlawful business practice to run an internet gaming service without some way of canceling the service online without requiring customers to call a phone number or mail a letter
335538 that means if you are away from your machine lost your pol cd deleted the application or forgot your pol id or password there is no way to reset your password online then you are screwed
335539 to cancel a content id from the playonline viewer choose service and support membership content id and select
335540 sign up in 30 seconds cancel in 3 months after hours on hold and endless disconnects etc
335541 just cancel your play online id and its easy lawl
335542 wah i cant figure out how to cancel an account
335543 im a guy you know that works in the government whats that you say unnecessary legislator to clog the system and spend taxpayers dollars this looks like a job for
335544 oh wow local state rep with something to prove man youre so brave
335545 its nothing citizens i love taking your tax dollars because youre too stupid to find the cancellation page
335546 i have returned fear not you shall no longer have to be bothered with being an adult or making financial decisions the government has done it all for you
335547 thank you local state rep with something to prove man
335548 just doing my duty citizens remember you are too stupid to make decisions on your own let the government handle it all
335549 we have concerns about the 360 version of rage because of the economics of the platform in terms of what it costs to go to multiple discs
335550 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
335551 let me be clear this is an open question we have these tech issues and we are working with microsoft to solve them
335552 i know that john is pretty much brass tacks on these issues and before the ps3 was ever released he raised the same issues then as now
335553 had a bunch of hardware engineers talking about theoretical power but carmack said yeah this isnt how software people work and they said yeah this is how they should work
335554 complaining about that is sort of a worthless exercise at this point
335555 the ps3 is what it is and its not going to change you have to adapt thats what we have done with id tech 5
335556 today we are saying that rage may look better on the ps3 than the 360
335557 i think the blu ray strategy and some of the other things theyve done in terms how the ps3 is positioned as a home entertainment device shows that sony is placing their bet on the ps3 as a marathon runner not a sprint and microsoft was a little more focused on the short term goals
335558 complaining about that is sort of a worthless exercise at this point
335559 the ps3 is what it is and its not going to change you have to adapt thats what we have done with id tech 5
335560 oh we have sold over 14 million consoles but 8 million crapped out we still got all those 6 million consoles out there
335561 yeah this isnt how software people work and they said yeah this is how they should work
335562 this is an xbox 360 disc to play please put it in an xbox 360 console
335563 im not hating on the 360 but i see sony being more prepared for the ps3 than ms is with its console i dont want to buy a 360 later on just have to need a add on that will cost me extra money and if they continue their life cyle hardware revisions for anything else new will have to be made which would still cost extra money id rather have ps3 off the bat if that is the case
335564 and the issue isnt just about the game being too big hollenshead says that developers lose upwards of 2 gigs of space per a disc because of information microsoft requires developers to put on the discs
335565 as soon as you start saying you have enough memory you better hide and watch brother
335566 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue
335567 even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
335568 and the issue isnt just about the game being too big hollenshead says that developers lose upwards of 2 gigs of space per a disc because of information microsoft requires developers to put on the discs
335569 hollenshead says that developers lose upwards of 2 gigs of space per a disc because of information microsoft requires developers to put on the discs
335570 today we are saying that rage may look better on the ps3 than the 360
335571 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
335572 no it sucks hard so i played for 5 min
335573 i guess well never know since im not going for it
335574 what warhammer is going to have achievements quick make up some achievements of our own
335575 achievements in wow because we keep dumbing down the game cant properly fix our crafting system which is broken for a lot of professions and are running out of ideas to keep people playing
335576 the next game in the doom universe is in development
335577 we do have the core of the team working on it under the direction of kevin cloud
335578 we are working on what the story is going to be for the game right now the logo shown during quakecon didnt have a four or a subtitle we havent made the decision about that yet there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one
335579 theres going to be big guns lots of blood and demons
335580 thats what we see as the core and thats what that game is about
335581 we are still working on the game and what its going to be about
335582 the goal for the game is that it will be the best game of its ilk when its released
335583 it will remain true to what doom is about this very visceral experience but we still want to obviously be innovative within that
335584 thats what we see as the core and thats what that game is about
335585 it will remain true to what doom is about this very visceral experience but we still want to obviously be innovative within that
335586 hell just came through and im alone to deal with it shit
335587 so that might be peter jackson unless microsoft has roped in other
335588 btw im not saying the commercials are bad theyre very well directed and good concepts they just seem 100 inappliccable to draw in new customers
335589 now if we could only get snoopy pingu mickey mouse and sephiroth in the same game
335590 i think they can easily start by having a better eu video marketplace
335591 the gameplay style in europe is more casual more collaborative and social
335592 nintendo is pwning us in europe and that makes us a sad sad panda
335593 if this game is good it should sell great here and there
335594 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pes series
335595 it is a game that truly mirrors the pace and control of real football and as a die hard fan of the series i am delighted to be working with konami on the latest version
335596 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pes series
335597 it is a game that truly mirrors the pace and control of real football and as a die hard fan of the series i am delighted to be working with konami on the latest version
335598 lionel messi is an incredibly exciting player and one who enjoys a world wide reputation for skill pace and all round ability
335599 as such he is the ideal player to front pes 2009 and his enthusiasm for the new game is certain to shine as we work closely together in the promotion of what will be the most advanced pes title to date
335600 wait delighted what kind of sports personality uses the word delighted youre supposed to trash talk other games players teams etc
335601 yeah we know youre gonna bring that smut home and wank to it
335602 for playstation 3 computer entertainment system and the xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from microsoft
335603 draw your own conclusions about that final fantasy xiii on xbox 360 announcement
335604 thats the way it is you cant do anything about it
335605 compared to the ps2 architecture the ps3 is much more easy to develop for though
335606 the rumors are true ps3 is a bitch to develop for and sony wouldnt help us
335607 we couldnt figure it out so we decided to fap to tera patrick instead
335608 delay for the ps3 version due to difficulty programming for the cell
335609 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
335610 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
335611 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on
335612 ill still be picking this up for pc i decided to sell my xbox 360 since i have an awesome gaming pc thatll play 99 percent of the 360 games i have or want to play at a better resolution 1080p and no lag mass effect with free content mass effect and free online as opposed to the gold subscription on the 360
335613 some of us are normal people and we all dont carry around screw drivers and pocket protectors
335614 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
335615 gawker media loves fanboys especially when theyre arguing the merits of removing one consoles hard drive over the other
335616 oh its just easier to do x than do y in order to do z
335617 omg its because m is giving you lots of money
335618 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar
335619 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
335620 so he prefers developing on the 360 because its easier to show tech demos off at shows awesome
335621 as has been mentioned above the removable storage units for teh ps3 and pc are actually a little easier to remove
335622 of course were more familiar with the xbox because thats the console weve developed for the most
335623 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage
335624 shit a logical story for the 360 not favoring the ps3 attack i gotta say something to attack and bring in the fanboy yeah well hard drives suck anyway it corrupts lolol yeah i showed them
335625 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally mr jackson said
335626 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability
335627 however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
335628 even if standard on pc these features are still premium on a console
335629 in essence youd like to see xbl gold become a true premium service and
335630 basically i see the distance between xbl and psn closing with each month and i want microsofts answer to that diminishing gap to be either changing direction and giving the service away if the differences are going to go away or further justifying it by re creating the gap again
335631 the reasons why x360 users continue to insist that their service is justified is that ms continues to put out good games on their platform good multiplayer options that either cannot be found elsewhere or is simply easier to deal with on the 360
335632 beyond that i feel like the value perceived is of ms as a whole and not just one service people feel like theyre paying for the privilege of having the next gears of war castle crashers avatar customization etc come out on the system
335633 its more to mss credit that theyve managed to take these previously free processes and monetize them
335634 so i feel like we ought to start there sorry for the long rant
335635 our goal is not to create a sterile environment where you move furniture around its about how can we make our gaming experiences better
335636 i get your complaint about being charged for xbl but complaining about having to pay for games and a console to play it on whats that about you act as if ms are the only ones who charge for a console and games
335637 they got me on hardware okay fine its worth it they get me on games fine thats the way things work
335638 also if you dont wanna make an avatar you dont have to if you decide to make an avatar though no one is gonna force you to customize it with priced avatar clothes and accessories
335639 these things have been free in reality for longer than ms has been charging for them
335640 nothing youve posted so far has been a positive attempt at changing anything so please dont paint me as a non constructive bad guy here
335641 im sorry that i dont have a problem paying for certain content and that i have the ability to ignore and not pay for the content that i dont feel justifies it instead of yelling every single time that it should be free
335642 does everyone here that is bitching about ms charging for extra content not realize that home is going to do the same thing
335643 if everyone simply stopped paying for it it wouldnt become free it would be stopped
335644 anyway it just kills me that so many people just want everything for free but never stop to consider the amount of man hours that go into creating content
335645 if you dont feel that something deserves the money dont buy it but for the love of pete stop whining
335646 this is a model that every company employs now and im sorry about your little dream world but its not going away if everyone simply stopped paying for it it wouldnt become free it would be stopped
335647 and he piled upon microsofts white hump the sum of all the rage and hate felt by similarly intelligent members of his race if his chest had been a cannon he would have shot his heart upon it
335648 they charge us for the hardware and software and we pay
335649 but you get to watch the commercials and other promotional pitches before everyone else
335650 in other words bet your ass well start charging for avatar customisation as soon as marketing gives us the green light
335651 anybody who says that voting with your wallet doesnt work needs to go buy a games for windows live subscription oh thats right you cant
335652 now be suuuuure to customize your avatar from the bluefly com accessory wall
335653 it would be cool if you could use gaming points to buy some things for your avatar
335654 our goal is not to create a sterile environment where you move furniture around its about how can we make our gaming experiences better
335655 fadel shana appears to have been killed deliberately although he was a civilian taking no part in attacks on israels forces
335656 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
335657 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
335658 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
335659 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
335660 est n cada vez m s solos y m s rechazados
335661 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
335662 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
335663 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
335664 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
335665 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
335666 could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
335667 lower 48 outer continental shelf will increase by about 200 000 barrels per day by contrast the production offset based on obamas proposal will likely approach 800 000 barrels per day
335668 mamn what were you doing at the wakonda country club
335669 i was attempting to make a citizens arrest of karl rove your honor
335670 the fact that citizens arrest is explicitly legal under the law in iowa should make this a fascinating study into legal rights in the state and to an extent in the united states
335671 stay in the state stay in the area and come to the illinois state fair
335672 we hope families will choose the missouri state fair as part of their vacation plans this summer
335673 were as gloomy as the sky im looking at right now
335674 i think what we offer to those chicago people which they dont have is livestock and opportunities to come down and be with the rest of the state
335675 obviously a trip to the fair would just add expenses
335676 then you compound that with a couple of family members you know going with their children
335677 if well have a hundred plus people going we think thats pretty good
335678 if we can get weather about 80 82 thatll draw people
335679 you get weather up around 90 95 that hurts the crowds
335680 i think people are going to take advantage of that maybe more so than in the past
335681 there are a lot of variables in the fair business fuel weather and things we cant control

335690 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
335691 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
335692 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
335693 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
335694 were still a little bit short but im not worried about it
335695 the obama campaign is on the ground and theyre helping out and you know well have all the money that we need to pay everybody on time according to their contracts
335696 estou votando nele racionalmente porque as propostas dele fazem sentido e porque ele pode ser um bom prefeito ou s porque fui com a cara dele

335702 in george lucass 1977 box office phenomenon star wars episode iv a new hope audiences around the world saw that women held their own in a galaxy far far away when princess leia stood up to darth vader in the movies opening scene then went on to greet luke skywalker with the unforgettable quip
335703 george wanted anakin to have a padawan and its just great that weve introduced not only a padawan to anakin but a new female character she is feisty shes got a great personality she has a really strong sense of herself and she challenges anakin to think differently so while she has been put in place to learn from anakin he also learns a lot from her and she is somebody that i think kids and particularly girls can relate to shes a really fantastic mentor type character
335704 in the star wars films theres a tradition of someone being taken on an amazing journey and learning to become a jedi luke was a farm boy swept up in the rebel alliance anakin was a little boy on tatooine in the clone wars anakin is no longer a padawan hes a jedi
335705 we needed a character who could add the dynamic that a student brings to the story and thats when we came up with the idea of ahoska
335706 i had always wanted to explore the idea of a padawan for anakin but didnt have time in the live action movies we bounced back and forth on a lot of ideas about her would she be human or alien male or female we thought a girl would be just more fun to have in the story and ahsoka takes on that role of the younger person who is being taught which is vital to the star wars movies
335707 we come across anakin and obi wan stranded in this big battle without many supplies and all they get sent to them is this young girl
335708 shes a devoted student of the jedi ways headstrong enthusiastic and eager to prove herself to master skywalker but she has yet to learn the finer points of diplomacy and timing
335709 we always felt it was important to have a character whose temperament is somewhere between anakins and
335710 anakin will just jump in anywhere while obi wan wants to think things through before taking action ahsoka appreciates anakins brashness but admires patience and thoughtfulness she has a lot to learn from both of them but is strong and capable in her own right so she sometimes surprises anakin with her approach to the kinds of situations they find themselves in she makes a great counterpoint to anakin visually in her personality her attitude she sort of drives him crazy but he grows very attached to her as youll see in the movie
335711 when princess leia joins luke hes been hanging out with han solo and chewbacca these two roughnecks
335712 she immediately takes charge on the death star saying i dont know who you are or where you come from but from now on you do as i say and then to chewbacca will somebody get this walking carpet out of my way she brought a lot of fun to the movie and for us ahsoka is very similar you can throw her in with obi wan and anakin who think pretty highly of themselves and now they have this young girl in there now who is saying yeah but im going to do things my way its fun to have that sort of banter back in star wars
335713 when we brought on ashley to do the voice of ahsoka she brought such a part of herself to it
335714 shes fantastic she is a lot like ahsoka and the combination of her voice with the visuals just came together beautifully she helped shape the character
335715 ashley naturally nailed it every time and helped make ahsoka a likable interesting and really refreshing young female character
335716 lo que queremos es adelantar unos estudios que nos se alen cuales son los fen menos espec ficos en cada rea para proponer medidas de mitigaci n y prevenci n entonces estamos haciendo nfasis hoy en d a en los sectores entre el tajamar occidental y la isla de bar

335720 claro que el que hayan salido positivos no quiere decir que sea para sanci n eso depende del tipo de sustancia que se les haya encontrado en las muestras porque puede haber alguna natural como la testosterona por ejemplo as que no se puede decir en este momento que ellos son responsables o culpables
335721 la nica manera de acabar con esto del dopaje es haciendo controles y trabajando mucho en la parte educativa de las categor as inferiores

335724 dit tart wat de knvb betreft alle fatsoensnormen daar is geen excuus voor geen enkele werkgever accepteert bedreigingen aan het adres van eigen personeel de knvb ook niet
335725 we hebben in het verleden niet vaak gereageerd op uitlatingen van deze scheidsrechter maar we laten ons echt niet neerzetten als onfatsoenlijke organisatie helaas gaat het vaak zo met dick jol je spreekt iets met hem af en vervolgens doet hij wat anders maar jol was een goede scheidsrechter en daar werd hij op beoordeeld anders was het al veel eerder tot een breuk gekomen
335726 those design deficiencies are the same ones of some of the levees down that katrina caused to fail
335727 but you have other parts of the city that are susceptible to flooding
335728 what has happened is there are more rooftops more asphalt more concrete therefore there are less opportunities for the water to be absorbed
335729 although we dont have an exact plan today the plan will be done in the next year or so and then council will need to decided how were gonna deal with it
335730 if money was no object and we had all the money we wanted then we could go solve it
335731 but in this case we have to find out whats the most economical way in our resources to address the flooding
335732 with extensive pressure on the levees the hydraulic pressure if we dont correct those design deficiencies then we could have some problems
335733 what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness

335754 im not sure which label fits me best but one thing i know beyond the shadow of a doubt when we remove the layers of labels like the grave clothes that confined lazarus we can look in the mirror and know in our hearts that we are christians
335755 we do have bike rack available through gate 9 and gate 10 theyre close together

335759 we decided that we want to attract a young upscale hip crowd and we thought the best way we could do that was to give them a theme so they could dress in costume

335761 id like to invite you as my guest to check out the ceilings at caliente
335762 cant be any worse than seeing bicyclist wannabees who look like the michelin tire man stuffed into lance armstrong spandex and pillsbury dough women walking around the beach in bikinis
335763 if the swingers could keep their play weekends to themselves there would be no problem
335764 the problem is that several times the swingers got carried away as swingers are wont to do and were doing it in the pool with people all around
335765 we havent seen any sexual activity in any of the pools over the past four months
335766 there are hugs and kisses and booty slapping but nothing sexual and nothing different than you would see at your local bar or club
335767 both the ecb and kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance
335768 kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
335769 ive fought a lot the last few years to be no 1
335770 to be seen as no 1 always is a goal
335771 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
335772 it was a little bit uncomfortable for a few points
335773 he was playing too well and my game was not up to scratch
335774 i just had to try and stay tough and not give up
335775 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
335776 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen
335777 to make my opponents all tired and then just beat them
335778 but i kept believing in myself and i knew that if i didnt make as many mistakes i could get back in the match
335779 a loved and missed family member not a brand name like mickey mouse
335780 sir donald would be adamant in his opposition to his use of his name so is his family
335781 i played christina a couple of months ago in a tournament in new zealand and i lost so i was pretty nervous
335782 i dont think i stopped feeling nervous until the fourth game i knew if i won here i would be in the semi finals so it was a huge motivation for me to do well

335787 uh honey they changed when im supposed to return home yet again for the 18th millionth time
335788 mama ik ben vandaag wel niet groter dan gisteren he
335789 but to those people i also ask how is an mmo universe supposed to work if everyone is the hero and influencing it in light and dark ways
335790 by nothing there i meant aside from the company itself i didnt find anything saying theyd done a study what the results were how they got them etc
335791 according to vietnamese law glitter will be freed on august 19

335798 mungkin kamu telalu banyak nonton film luar negeri dan menggunakan prouknya
335799 because ultimately unless you make it a random occurence it will be a game mechanic that players will work out and proceed to grind on until they reach their goal this is the nature of gamers and it staggers us that you dont acknowledge that and jesus even if you did make it a random occurence people would just keep re rolling characters until they got a force sensitive one anyway so thats not an option either
335800 we can only protect you we cant fight a war for you
335801 put a lifeline on a jedi actually have them age until eventually they arent very useful in a fight of course there will be benefits in aging as well increase in wisdom the ability to train new upcoming jedis as a profession strategic masterminds the ability to see the outcome of battles of a group to an extent something like that
335802 star wars knights of the old republic 3 from bioware proper
335803 man those ideas you used to have on the dev forum would have worked out 100 times better than what they finally did with swg
335804 lets get a solid real game world working here that people will be happy to play in five years from now because theres lot of cool sandbox options and if theres pvp on top of that hey bonus
335805 wow wouldnt it be cool to be a jedi theyre like magic space ninjas
335806 star wars kotor mmo make it a single player kotor 3
335807 the fact remains it will be absolutely stupid and highly unrealistic of established star wars canon
335808 force sensitives were never in 25 000 years numerous enough for it to make sense to have them as a playable class in an mmo
335809 mmos are increasingly turning into multiplayer versions of single player games
335810 knights you know jedi knights of the old republic and then making jedi knights a non player class is slightly retarded
335811 right but that would also favour power levellers who would be among the more obnoxious types playing jedi while ignoring some excellent pve people and rp people who sometimes level a lot slower but could probably play a jedi 100 times better
335812 right but that would also favour power levellers who would be among the more obnoxious types playing jedi while ignoring some excellent pve people and rp people who sometimes level a lot slower but could probably play a jedi 100 times better
335813 gt how about having gamemasters pick up players who deserve to be playing a jedi
335814 im going to comment on my own piece and say it just occured to me that the game could have a no playable jedi server in other words if they really must have playable jedi in the game why not experiment with a server where you simply cant make one no other changes just no jedi i think it would be fascinating to see how many people would use it i wager if would be quite a few based on the number of people ive seen over the years who absolutely hated playable jedi being in swg
335815 what do you know casey anthony is a fucking loony

335839 this is a tiny 8 1 2 pound baby that is so sweet and loving despite her injury i am hoping we can get her into a great rescue group soon to continue her medical healing
335840 we wish we were not in this position of having to ask for extra financial assistance but these are not normal times
335841 with everyones help we have survived the situation so far but we want to make sure that we have funds available to continue our practice of paying our vet bills in full every month
335842 we have a wonderful opportunity to double any donations made now to help us through this difficult time we have 90 dogs currently in our system which is taxing not only our ability to find foster homes but also to fund the vet and boarding bills that come along with each dog we rescue if you can help by making a donation of any amount a donor will double your donation up to a maximum of 5 000 total
335843 we are so excited about partnering with chef ward for this wonderful event
335844 we have more than 50 greyhounds up for adoption now and the proceeds from this event will ensure they have the care they need until they are placed in homes
335845 good news norbert has been pulled and is in foster care now the mange has ravaged his poor body but hes headed to the vet this afternoon thursday and will hopeful be on the road to recovery soon we will update as we know more and give people an opportunity to contribute to his care thanks to everyone who circulated this poor guy around
335846 the great news is he is heartworm negative and already neutered
335847 norbert is going for his bath today and his foster mom is just so wonderful and patient
335848 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
335849 i never thought it would come to this we always got threats and this one really did come through

335853 i dont really know what they can do about it but its inconvenient to walk through bird crap

335855 so every day clean up some bird poop or at least before a big event

335864 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
335865 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
335866 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
335867 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
335868 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
335869 four years ago if someone said the conservative party were going to do a float for pride we would have been laughed out of the city
335870 last year we were amazed at the positive response and thats why all the team here in brighton and hove wanted to put together a float that represents the fact that brighton is the best place to be in the world its somewhere that everyone can be themselves
335871 the bad is im not able to come up there now and compete the good is that my clock doesnt start until january so that gives me a chance to get an extra spring ball under my belt that could really help me out in the future
335872 what does a reversion to barbarism mean at the present stage of european civilization
335873 the collapse of all civilization as in ancient rome depopulation desolation degeneration a great cemetery
335874 humanity is facing the alternative dissolution and downfall in capitalist anarchy or regeneration through the social revolution
335875 profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization that lies unveiled before our eyes turning from its home where it assumes respectable forms to the colonies where it goes naked
335876 hideous pagan idol who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain
335877 the delay of the socialist revolution engenders the indubitable phenomena of barbarism chronic unemployment pauperization of the petty bourgeoisie fascism finally wars of extermination which do not open up any new road
335878 tomorrow could be too late lets do now what we need to do
335879 a dystopic possible future world in which social problems are made much worse by the environmental consequences of rising greenhouse gas emissions
335880 climate change is or could be the additional factor which will exacerbate the existing problems of poverty environmental degradation social polarisation and terrorism and it could lead to a very chaotic situation
335881 a situation where the rich live in enclaves protected and the poor live outside in unsustainable conditions
335882 ultimately climate change is a threat to humanity as a whole but it is the poor a constituency with no responsibility for the ecological debt we are running up who face the immediate and most severe human costs
335883 its about time for tom and katie to live alone
335884 hes very close with his sisters and his mother and he always welcomes his family into his house
335885 cass and her sons have been an integral part of toms life and cass helps take care of toms children when he is away
335886 he assured her that they would not be moving in with them
335887 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
335888 crist praised mccain for his support of florida issues such as a national catastrophic fund for disasters and a continued oil drilling ban off of floridas coasts
335889 i do not support a national catastrophic insurance policy that insurance policy is there and its called fema and its called national disaster preparedness i still do not have confidence that fema is capable of handling those responsibilities
335890 not in favor of spending 200 billion a year simply for the state of florida
335891 once again john mccain has made clear that he is much more interested in standing with george bush than getting the facts right or doing whats right
335892 if we eliminate all possibilities which are definitely incorrect the remaining possibility however unrealistic is true
335893 how exactly did the media know that gore was so smart and bush so dumb
335894 7 ways to build an online 6 figure sales force
335895 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
335896 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
335897 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
335898 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
335899 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
335900 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
335901 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
335902 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
335903 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
335904 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
335905 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
335906 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
335907 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
335908 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

335911 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
335912 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
335913 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
335914 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
335915 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
335916 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
335917 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

335922 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

336160 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
336161 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
336162 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
336163 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
336164 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
336165 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity

336203 i hope those who have evidence of such practice would submit a report through the right channel i believe some wanita umno members are involved in this we have 1 3 million members and there are bound to be some who are guilty of money politics

336417 wahai tuan apakah menurut anda ayat yang berbunyi telah dekat hari qiamat dan bulan pun telah terbelah mengandung mukjizat secara ilmiah
336418 wahai muhammad kalau engkau benar nabi dan rasul coba tunjukkan kepada kami satu kehebatan yang bisa membuktikan kenabian dan kerasulanmu dengan nada mengejek dan meng olok2
336419 sungguh telah dekat hari qiamat dan telah terbelah bulan dan ketika melihat tanda2 kebesaran kami merekapun ingkar lagi berpaling seraya berkata

336423 kebodohan macam apalagi ini dana yang begitu besar dibuangoleh as hanya untuk bisa mendarat di bulan
336424 tidak tujuannya tidak semata menancapkan ilmu pengetahuan as di bulan akan tetapi kami mempelajari kandungan yang ada di dalam bulan itu sendiri maka kami pun telah mendapat hakikat tentang bulan itu yang jika kita berikan dana lebih dari 100 juta dollar untuk kesenangan manusia maka kami tidak akan memberikan dana itu kepada siapapun
336425 hakikat apa yang kalian telah capai hingga demikian mahal taruhannya
336426 ternyata bulan pernah mengalami pembelahan di suatu hari dahulu kala kemudian menyatu kembali
336427 kami mendapati secara pasti ari batu2 an yang terpisah karena terpotong di permukaan bulan sampai di dalam perut bulan
336428 hal ini tidak mungkin terjadi kecuali jika memang bulan pernah terbelah lalu bersatu kembali
336429 maka aku pun turun dari kursi dan berkata mukjizat kehebatan benar2 telah terjadi pada diri muhammad shallallahu alaihi wassallam 1400 an tahun yang lalu allah benar2 telah mengolok2 as untuk mengeluarkan dana yang begitu besar hingga 100 juta dollar hanya untuk menetapkan akan kebenaran muslimin agama islam ini tidak mungkin salah lalu aku pun kembali membuka mushhaf dan aku baca surat al qamar dan saat itu adalah awal aku menerima dan masuk islam

336485 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
336486 trails of destruction across several houses in south england the first one happened last thursday the house was basically inside out when the owners got home there was a note with an address on it apparently the house of that address was destroyed three days later with another address left on a note inside that house was just down the street from the second one and was burnt to the ground the monday just gone everything was destroyed apart from another note another address and so the chain goes on there seems to be no pattern of address or any particular link between the victims
336487 the last place that was destroyed you have the address that was left inside it
336488 well actually no either there was no note or the police are hiding something
336489 those police are always messing things up for us making our job harder
336490 an old man who live in the house which burned to the ground apparently his family were going to visit him and they just found the piece of paper well there were no bones or anything so we cant rule out the possibility that hes hiding or been kidnapped or something i think he was a bit of a nutter anyway
336491 peter paepre 75 years old wife died a year previously from cancer he had a son and a daughter his son was convicted of rape about a month after his mothers death and is still in prison for various crimes i think i wouldnt be surprised if peter was a nutter his daughter however has done quite well for herself she has a husband and twin boys shelley carter you may have heard of her shes an author
336492 and youre sure there was no note gwen get me pictures of this house
336493 i think its a locator of some sort but im not certain see what you can find out but be very careful
336494 look 15 53 house intact peter paepre looking out the kitchen window as if hes expecting guests his daughters family presumably then the screen just goes blank when it comes back on its 17 53 two hours later exactly and theres no peter and no house theres not even a curl of smoke left
336495 ive tried everything it was easier before because that was cctv for our own headquarters this is something completely different altogether the footage shown is controlled from somewhere else if i could go there and find out where the cameras being controlled from i might just be able to do it though
336496 good work tosh i was thinking we might go there anyway question the locals see if they saw anything unusual so even if you cant get the footage we might still be able to find out what happened
336497 would either of you care to tell us whats going on
336498 i think the answer to everything may lie in the plot of this book
336499 basically as you can probably guess from the title this book has chain mail in it but its not your average chain mail
336500 hate chain mail but a lot worse than it sounds
336501 i think its time we payed shelley carter a visit dont you think
336502 we were looking at the pictures before the house was destroyed to see if there was any indication of what was to come and we were looking at the pictures after it had been destroyed to see if there was any indication of the next target
336503 nothing at all if we had had more time i would have found pictures of the other houses to compare them but time is of the essence if were to stop any more buildings from being destroyed did you find anything owen
336504 aside from that no i havent found anything i have absolutely no idea what the device does i just managed to turn it on where did you get it from jack
336505 from an old friend he said there was another part to it though which he didnt have maybe thats why it isnt doing anything it needs its other part to function
336506 but there could be numerous other reasons why it isnt showing any data we might not be in the right place you said yourself jack you think its some kind of locater
336507 thats because when youre here you can smell the evil that went into this and the heartbreak that came out of it
336508 tosh ianto go and see what you can do about that cctv footage gwen come with me and well go around the neighbourhood see what we can find owen you stay here look around the wreckage and keep the locator out at all times see if anything happens well all meet back here in half an hour no excuses and dont go anywhere different without letting me know
336509 how do we let you know if we cant come and find you
336510 i was looking on the way here and i think ive located where the cctv camera was
336511 the whole thing is kind of an s then the top bit is a c and the bottom bit is a j
336512 more things are falling into place if thats true jack will want to know about this
336513 i dont think we should split up and besides jack told you to help me figure out the cctv and thats exactly what youre going to do come on lets go find a way in
336514 please just do a little forgetting for now for my sake i need time to think or ill send you back to wait with owen
336515 yes i do know that but you seem to be heading in a very specific direction
336516 hey what can i say this game has no rules now come on youre slowing me down
336517 i have a special scanner in my bag on the cctv camera theres something quite similar to a bar code ill scan it and itll give me a special code to tap into the blank footage
336518 that might come in handy ill remember that now come on we need to get onto the roof
336519 you see that house at the end there with the flag in the window
336520 are you ok now or would you like us to stay longer because if youre all right we have some errands we can be doing
336521 of course sorry thank you again i really couldnt have survived without you
336522 perhaps we should go back now our half hours up
336523 so i was standing just here and then i pressed this button and and it was horrible
336524 after it seems such a coincidence that it happened here
336525 of course i didnt imagine it what do you take me for
336526 i must have pressed the button by accident aah turn it off turn it off
336527 not just any address the next address the address that was destroyed after this one
336528 tosh ianto youll take the car and go back to the base and well go on to the next address following the trail until we get a new one presuming that this is the trail of destruction that were following any questions
336529 what do we do once weve found the cctv footage
336530 relate your findings to us it might be of use and then stay at the base well asked you if the addresses we find are the ones we need
336531 and what do we do when weve got the new address
336532 we go there and we evacuate it and we guard it and we stay there until something happens lets roll
336533 i want to check if this is the next address
336534 theyve been getting on a little better than usually since they came down from the roof
336535 its the second part of the scanner i made it later on more of a convenience than a necessity really
336536 now we have to type it all in number by number
336537 ill start tracking a route to the address you just concentrate on getting owen back with us
336538 it would be so much easier if we still had the car
336539 i mean it this time i am never ever ever touching that thing again never
336540 but you should be dead you are dead i saw it all happen i was there
336541 i feel alive and i dont think im dreaming either unless we both died in the explosion and just havent realised it yet
336542 im not the only who hasnt aged d dad were both alive and were both the same age we were when when we died
336543 i hate to break you guys up but we still have to get to that house you know
336544 elen theres so much we need to say but right now just isnt the right time well talk later i promise when all the danger is over
336545 but what if what if you die i mean properly
336546 not that i dont trust you completely or anything but are you sure this is wise
336547 i have complete faith in my daughter owen and you would do well do remember that she is a lot older than she looks and has gained a lot more experience than you ever could
336548 oh keep your fucking hairnet on its not my bloody fault
336549 oh please dont pretend youre so hurt we all know youre just putting it on
336550 dont you dare think you can boss me around you dont know squat about me
336551 dont you think we have more important things to worry about gwen try and calm down a bit owen try and listen more carefully to gwens instructions shes the one who knows where were going
336552 im not going to be left behind dad not again
336553 and youve typed in so much already surely youre almost
336554 theres no time like the present come on were going in
336555 good afternoon mr harkness how very nice to see you again
336556 yes you really should have i expected a lot better from you and this must be owen harper
336557 yes i know all of you and the newest recruitment of the team gwen cooper
336558 surely not toshiko my i thought you were taller than that
336559 shes not with us shes never worked for us shelley i suggest that you let her go free and get one life off your conscience
336560 i simply cannot believe this little invention of mine worked so well it lured you right into my trap
336561 i believe i owe you an explanation it was i who caused the diversion so my colleagues could destroy the house that held all the information you needed and its occupants it was i who planted these locators on you so i could track your every move i meant for them both to get to you jack and it was a miscalculation on my part that the other half fell into the possession of this little girl but no matter mistakes can be rectified ill enjoy watching you burn
336562 you mean lets see what ive got you didnt exactly help matters
336563 we asked her all sorts of questions and all she would say was i fight fire with fire thats all she would say nothing else
336564 eventually we just had to give up and let the police carry on they said theyd let us know if they managed to coax her into making sense
336565 well good luck to them i wont be expecting a call any time soon
336566 yeah but i never attempted to politically destabilize former soviet republics did i

336569 toyotron is a new thai company with three electric motorcycles in its range and plans to add two more in the very near future now were not suggesting for a moment that the name has any relationship to that other well known brand which sells more motor vehicles than ford and general motors but well check out the companys logo apart from the name and logo the companys range topping hunter is not exactly an original concept either when i saw it in a motorcycle shop in thailand i was very impressed with the integrity of design and the styling and functionality of the entire package it seemed original but within a few hours of posting the story a reader alerted us to the similarity to hondas big ruckus which had not sold in the motorcycle markets i was familiar with since we posted the story a few hours ago weve now added pics of hondas big ruckus in the gallery section and the toyotron hunter is as similar to hondas big ruckus as the logo and name is to that of toyota no it doesnt have a 250 gas burning engine but everything else about the machine is somewhere between similar and well you decide by looking at the pics the top of the range hunter is selling in thailand for thb 59 000 about us 1750 and can run around 70 kilometres on a single charge from a standard power outlet the company claims that the cost to drive the hunter a kilometre is approximately seven satang thats one hundredth of a thai baht based on thai electricity rates and that comes in at a staggering one fifth of a united states cent while were not sure about that claim its clearly ridiculously cheap to run wherever you might be and whatever you get charged for your electricity the hunter has a top speed of around 70 kmh 43 mph which is more than fast enough for thailand in general and bangkok in particular where speeds rarely exceed 60 kmh anywhere but the expressway
336570 quick no ones around for once you get 3 takes and comp it best you can
336571 i know that according to reports that he wanted to bring media people and cameras and his campaign staffers

336575 they sat very close together she only had eyes for him
336576 at one point she placed her hand on his leg
336577 theyre on and off but its never really over between them
336578 well they paid for two they can have two i guess
336579 of course im famous you probably dont recognize me from this angle but i starred in banging toms mom 37 a whale of a time its widely seen as the citizen kane of ass to mouth
336580 listen youre not attractive enough to be a bitch okay
336581 lets see closest friends chase wright p j pilittere joe muich claggett russo malec corona pena jackson i mean when were here man everybody is everybodys buddy were all here to accomplish one thing and thats win so for us to be able to get along with everybody else its the biggest thing i feel that as far as relationships i didnt have in the past weve taken great leaps forward with one another id say pretty much everyone behind that door man
336582 making sure that i was able to go out there with confidence in myself that was the biggest thing early on i wasnt quite sure and i had a rough go early the second month things started clicking id have a rough game and i was just trying to make sure i didnt have another rough game so id say just overall confidence in myself to be able to do what i know how to do
336583 i think it doesnt matter what team were on weve all got a shot or else we wouldnt be here my role has changed completely ive gone from a six or seven inning starter to now im a one two three inning reliever so for me its give me the ball here we go
336584 today i took my most of my stuff at first the other day it was at second base just a different spot every day trying to get where im playing that day and then go in the outfield for about a round of bp or so its kind of half horsing around half trying to take some fly balls i went out there for a couple games earlier this year and that didnt go so well but hopefully they give me another shot out there
336585 absolutely the first goal is to make it there then youve got to find a way to stick pinch hitter whatever it is get there and whatever role they put you in try to succeed at that and hopefully the role increases if it increases great if it doesnt just try to maintain that and do what youve got to do to stick there
336586 seeing some of the players that weve come up with over the past like ian robertson and of course joba guys that youve played with over the past few years you see that theyre opening doors and theyre trusting their farm system i think they do a good job with developing our players we learn how to win at each level i think most of the organization is winning again this year it gives you a little encouragement and a little confidence that if an injury happens to occur youve got an opportunity to possibly go up there
336587 i played for the cardinals in t ball i remember that i was probably about six i just remember the uniform i dont remember anything about the baseball really bright red the cardinal logo across stirrups the whole thing i played second base growing up pretty much all through little league and all that but what i really remember is just playing outside in the front yard with a tennis ball and a bat it was just me and another kid he was a little bit older you hit the ball and then you run after it and you get the person out by trying to pluck em so those are my memories of growing up and playing basseball in the front yard and little league just playing second base
336588 i was 15 when i started in the dominican league not with an organization or anything i remember pitching there it was really fun

336603 my question is in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead why is it you have not had the ability not one time to speak to the interests of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country

336633 this is a top forum for hearing important new scientific research and for productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids

336636 as a global community we should be ashamed that 9 out of every 10 hiv positive children get the virus from their mothers during pregnancy childbirth or breastfeeding a particular tragedy because mother child transmission can be safely stopped prevention services can reduce transmission risk to less than 2 but only about 1 in 10 hiv positive pregnant women who need arvs get them theres no acceptable reason to not put an end to mother to child transmission
336637 without addressing the needs of children impacted by hiv and aids and of those infected by mother child transmission specifically the iac will sadly prove to be just another expensive talking shop to the millions who need action now

336657 what legitimate non religious reasons would serve to indicate the state should not recognize same sex marriages
336658 a marriage between a postoperative transsexual and a person of the opposite sex may be the basis for benefits where the state in which the marriage occurred recognizes the change in sex of the postoperative transsexual and considers the marriage a valid heterosexual marriage
336659 well the court and society use the genders of the couple seeking marriage as a de facto sexual orientation test to determine marital eligibility
336660 it isnt up to the state to tell one church that they can or cannot offer the sacrament of marriage to a couple for religious reasons
336661 the state is not required to recognize what the church does
336662 all the state can do is determine the legality of things like marriages
336663 but if the state determines that a marriage does not meet its legal clauses then it does not have to recognize the marriage regardless of what the church says
336664 prohibiting gay marriage isnt discrimination because no one has the right to marry someone of their same sex whereas everyone has the right to marry someone of the opposite gender
336665 all men are created equal with a right to life liberty
336666 do you support recognizing the relationship between two 1 citizens and all the rights and privileges therein

336669 not only would going fully metric cost a fortune to implement in britain it would also not go down well with a majority of the motoring public

336671 remember september 11 2001 when you first heard the news about the world trade center attacks remember where you were when you saw those images now think back to september 10 it was only one day before remember that day anything at all
336672 it represents one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physiological psychology
336673 the amygdala triggers a rapid fear response to allow the body to take evasive action
336674 if for example the curve turns out to be a piece of hosepipe in the grass then the prefrontal cortex reins in the amygdala response
336675 this stress induced memory boost is a mechanism that evolved for survival
336676 something very threatening needs to be remembered so in the future youre primed for action immediately
336677 it was the first time it had been possible to prevent ptsd from occurring by using a drug
336678 emotional memories are excessively imprinted and propranolol is able to reduce them to the level of an ordinary non emotionally charged memory
336679 this is probably the first serious convergence of psychological therapy and neuroscience so its quite intriguing and very exciting
336680 people tend to think about memory altering drugs as science fiction
336681 not true these drugs will be available within five to 10 years and they will alter our lives entirely in modulating a persons memories we are talking about nothing less than altering the central part of what it means to be a human being
336682 i would not say that a holocaust survivor should be prevented from wiping painful memories just so that society can benefit from their experience
336683 a person who has undergone something they feel guilty about is troubled by their memory for a reason the nightmares make them a better person because they realise the implications of their actions it feels bad to hurt other people i believe such drugs will make us worse as people
336684 what is no longer in doubt is that the technology to carry out this type of memory erasure will exist
336685 now we have to decide if it is ethically acceptable
336686 i used to buy this idea that sleep must be doing something really vital because it prevents you from doing all these other things like eating and procreating but thats not the way the animal kingdom works
336687 fifteen per cent can really make a difference between mediocre and superb performance
336688 over the long haul over not hours but days and months and years the cumulative benefit of sleep may become immense
336689 the influence is so small its unlikely sleeps main function is for memory
336690 they looked as though they could go on being deprived like that forever
336691 this supports the idea that rem sleep has a neurophysiological role such as memory consolidation
336692 in the wild the best strategy for passing on your genes is to be asleep for as long as you can get away with
336693 calculations of potential energy savings show these are trivial in humans for example 8 hours sleep saves as little energy as that contained in a cup of milk so energy conservation is an unlikely explanation for why sleep evolved
336694 that might have to be explained species by species or there may be certain general things that happen in most mammals but not other animals
336695 those kinds of issues do still have to be resolved
336696 for example we dont know if there are differences in the arousal threshold in sleeping animals and currently there are very few species for which we have data on both sleep duration and brain structure
336697 there would have been a time when gene transfer was the dominant evolutionary force
336698 it is easy to imagine a jurassic park of cellular evolution with experimental study of various reconstructed ancestral forms

336728 we tried to get the day changed to the thursday before or the monday after
336729 when there is a disagreement we always go with the regulations its the law
336730 the first year it was about running across p e i
336731 once i got to p e i i got to see what the childrens wish foundation is all about and how important it is to the people of p e i once you see the magnitude of what they do and you see a child with a smile on their face it really hits home
336732 when we saw him come home with his family and see his face i guarantee you one thing there wasnt many dry eyes
336733 for these children their illnesses make them grow up a little bit faster everybody is entitled to a childhood for a time in their lives theyre taken away from being a child and have to deal with illness i think all of us on the ship see these children as our heroes
336734 we go rain or shine it doesnt matter if theres a tornado or a hurricane were going

336736 our aim is to encourage people that live and work within the watershed to install renewable energy systems in their home or their business
336737 we heard loud and clear from rural and urban communities and particularly the summerside area that climate change was an important issue for them environmentally one of their top concerns
336738 its hopefully going to be a start for us in moving in that direction
336739 it has been addressed with the youngster and the families involved
336740 we certainly do our best to make sure incidents like that dont happen

336742 theres no question the incidents have brought the issue to light
336743 we basically had to convince softball canada and over time they were convinced to give us more tournaments nobody really had an idea all this was going to happen
336744 we rounded up about 20 volunteers and surrounded the field with cars and got them to turn on their headlights
336745 softball canada couldnt believe we got that field ready to play by 9 a m the next morning sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get these things done
336746 thats the reason that we now have what we have
336747 they werent struggles it was what we had and we made the absolute best of it

336752 the 2007 chargers have clearly given away their super bowl contender status and become this years test case for the time proven phrase coaching matters which reminds me 1 a few readers e mailed me about this when norv turner was coaching the raiders in 2005 i created a three games into norvs tenure with the chargers we already have six of the nine categories checked guys arguing on the sidelines check embarrassing losses at home no qb getting sacked and throwing the ball up for grabs check just an ungodly amount of penalties no steady stream of excuses check players taking veiled shots at the coaching staff check general malaise and dissatisfaction within the fan base check local columnists taking shots at him check big coaching name looming in the background as a replacement no basically were a penalty filled upset loss to the chiefs followed by rumors of bill cowher taking over the chargers from the entire norv turner second half collapse checklist getting filled before the baseball playoffs start i think this is amazing 2 a longtime reader named jason created a norv related blog called named after the story when my buddy hopper drove norv from a blackjack table because norv kept staying on 16 against a 10 hes been hired as a head coach not once but twice since i retold this story on espn com as herm edwards would say clearly more nfl owners need to have the internet 3 everyone keeps blaming norv and with reason but for whatever reason defensive coordinator ted cottrell hasnt been treated with the same level of scorn remember what the guy who knows things said before the season san diego is the perfect storm for bad norv as a head coach and ted cottrell as the defensive coordinator you cannot get any worse than that consider how laveranues coles described belichick and mangini this week and youll feel like bobby knight felt every time he faced dale brown by not picking norv and the chargers they have a very smart coaching staff and we have a very smart coaching staff they basically use us as chess pieces how they position us to play this game thats the main thing now whoever can make the adjustments the best and the fastest will probably have the edge with norv and ted they cannot beat enough of the good chess players the game is in the details and they leave too many untouched so what happens to this chargers team the rest of the way i see them rebounding with a 4 1 run over the next six weeks kc broncos oak bye hous minny before the annual second half norv collapse kicks off in november indy jags balt kc tenn and we can break out the checklist again well have all the checkmarks filled before week 15 i promise you
336753 were confident every day it doesnt matter how things go for you were not going to give up were just going to go and play the game like ive said and move on if it doesnt happen so who cares theres always next year its not like the end of the world or something
336754 i think we all know what type of player chris is hes going to take the pressure off a lot of us on this offense obviously the receiving group meaning gates vincent jackson hes going to take a lot of pressure off them guys even philip having another target to throw to as far as the running game hes going to help us out in that too teams are going to have to really now choose if you want to play eight men in the box and leave them guys one on one in the famous words of t o get your popcorn ready
336755 the problem with this guy is that he never found a position in college miami tried him at cb wr and rb and never really played him at any position consistently where hester will make his impact in the nfl though is in the return game since hes a quick little fucker i wouldnt mind the chargers taking a flyer on him in the 3rd or 4th round have him return kicks with sproles and develop him as a cb for when they decide theyre done watching jammer suck
336756 for instance 0 6 miami knows the 07 pats could knock the 72 dolphins out of the record books in three months but what could they do to stop them theyre not beating them in a game if they made a fishy trade to help out one of new englands rivals like giving away chris chambers to san diego for a late second round pick for example everyone would find it fishy and the league would crack down because after all youre not supposed to cheat in the national football league theyre helpless to stop it in fantasy fishy trades happen all the time and you cant stop them unless you have a commissioner whos stronger and more powerful than david stern at his peak unfortunately 98 percent of fantasy football leagues have a gary bettman type note thank god the nfl doesnt work like fantasy and san diego couldnt steal chambers away for a measly second round pick simply because miami wanted to take a dump on their fans tank their season and preserve the legacy of the 72 dolphins because that would suck
336757 we think youre soooo pitiful that we feel sorry for you

336768 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
336769 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
336770 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
336771 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
336772 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
336773 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
336774 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
336775 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
336776 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
336777 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
336778 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
336779 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
336780 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
336781 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
336782 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
336783 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
336784 sold juelzs contract to parent label def jam for 2 million
336785 but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter
336786 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
336787 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
336788 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
336789 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
336790 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
336791 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
336792 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
336793 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
336794 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
336795 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
336796 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
336797 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
336798 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
336799 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
336800 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
336801 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
336802 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
336803 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
336804 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
336805 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
336806 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
336807 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
336808 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
336809 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
336810 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
336811 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
336812 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
336813 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
336814 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
336815 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
336816 what your buddies lifted him up and and you pulled a pair of clown pants on him maybe the floppy shoes too yeah lets see the guy walk back into the building in
336817 it was pretty much the same with the last record
336818 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
336819 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
336820 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
336821 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
336822 clip count olaf stops to buy treats for the children
336823 we believe the terms of this agreement will provide strong protection to our brand worldwide
336824 i didnt know that we had a fuel issue until five laps to go
336825 just when they said that i knew i was in trouble because the car stumbled a bit in turn five and i thought oh no with five to go we are not going to make it i milked it as much as i could i started short shifting and i knew darren was doing the same because he was not pulling away from me but we came up just half a lap shy
336826 my heart is broken for the team its broken for alex
336827 i thought that this was going to be our day the car was great it took some abuse and just kept on going ajr and ruby tuesday have been up front in the last two races with this car weve got new life but now weve got to convert that life into podiums which we should be doing every weekend joey and the ruby tuesday team did a great job today
336828 every time i got side by side with him his way of racing was to just run into you ive had this with him before it seems everyone else drives cleanly but him unfortunately the sanctioning body never saw what everyone else saw on television i dont know how they didnt see it
336829 the performance of the team and the car were fantastic in terms of strategy we rolled the dice hoping for a late yellow or a little bit of help towards the end and we just didnt get it so we came up about half a gallon short it would not have made any difference to our finishing position had we come in for a splash of fuel because we would have ended up in the same place
336830 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
336831 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
336832 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
336833 received information that suggests the other driver may have been travelling upwards of 50 miles an hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
336834 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
336835 a banker is the fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain

336837 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
336838 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
336839 when you fly a lot you get into a rhythm when booking tickets so i didnt even know i was being charged until my wife noticed it on our credit card statements
336840 it doesnt even show up on your receipt it tripped me up again last week ive had enough i am so angry with them
336841 we tried to make it very obvious that the box is checked and that if you dont want the insurance you need to uncheck it
336842 it would be one thing if we had it in fine print somewhere but if you look at the web site and the way its presented i dont think its sneaky at all its very transparent
336843 id rather face the whole british army than face the bell witch again
336844 the biggest misconception is that women can have orgasms through intercourse but 70percent of women dont and thats totally normal guys dont just lie back hoping to have an orgasm they pick a thrusting style to suit them women need to do the same and take control
336845 the trick to achieving orgasm is to put pressure on your clitoris by rotating your pelvis during sex
336846 good positions for this are with the woman on top or with the man behind and if you tighten your pelvic muscles your orgasm will be more intense
336847 these positions are also great for hitting the g spot which is around the urethra tissue the part you can feel through the vaginal wall its not miles in like we all previously thought
336848 another good orgasm tip is to give up on trying to climax simultaneously
336849 surpass ed demanding fundraising goals and skillfully demonstrate ed to voters that they stand for change and will represent new priorities when elected to congress
336850 tom has continued success on the fundraising front in a district where its not easy to be successful
336851 hes put together a successful grassroots effort he appears to be connecting with voters
336852 to get there this early is a real sign of confidence
336853 they like liberal democrats like perriello with his liberal views
336854 they will continue to work hard for him because they want conservatives like me out of congress
336855 my professional goal since ive been back at this plant is that i want to drive down goodyear boulevard on my 80th birthday and see that parking lot full
336856 our goal in this plant is to keep it going another 40 years and maintain our standard of living so everyone working here can retire here
336857 i truly believe this plant is headed in the right direction were doing all the right things
336858 its very critical to me that this plant has a smooth transition to the new manager
336859 i moved to danville in 1971 when i was 22 and my wife was 18
336860 all three of my kids were born in danville memorial hospital ive lived here more of my adult life than anywhere else
336861 shes followed me around every place ive worked in north america and when we moved to spartanburg we made the decision to work around her career
336862 i want to get back to where i can work out of my home
336863 the people that started this plant up they were the greatest generation
336864 they had a special worker in this plant and they imprinted on me thats where i got my values from i feel like im part of the plant

336889 iraq is predicted to pump 70 billion dollars worth of oil this year that gives them a 50 billion dollar budget surplus
336890 the administration iraqi government and everyone say that getting this national oil law is a prerequisite for political reconciliation and the us being able to get out sooner to the extent that the situation is becoming chaotic it is hurting the chances for that
336891 this is really good for us i find it a huge compliment that he is tipping us off about this this is a lucky break

336910 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally mr jackson said
336911 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability

336915 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness

336917 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
336918 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

337153 the strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments
337154 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
337155 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
337156 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
337157 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
337158 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
337159 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
337160 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community
337161 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation

337170 this is an internal israeli matter the palestinian authority deals with the prime minister of israel regardless if he is olmert or somebody else
337171 the concern of the palestinian authority is to have an israeli prime minister who is committed to peacemaking
337172 i have never looked at olmert as a great gift for peace or the great savior and therefore i dont feel that his political demise is the end of the peace process
337173 this issue is much larger than one person individuals make a difference but at the same time there are parties involved national policies involved
337174 there are worrying signs appearing in the united states where some locals are beginning to hoard supplies
337175 were told that the feds bought the entire container of canned butter when it hit the california docks somethings up
337176 we regret to inform you oregon freeze dry cannot satisfy all mountain house 10 can orders and we have removed 10 cans from our website temporarily
337177 the reason for this is sales of 10 cans have continued to increase ofd is allocating as much production capacity as possible to this market segment but we must maintain capacity for our other market segments as well
337178 we want to clarify inaccurate information weve seen on the internet
337179 we expect this situation to be necessary for several months although this isnt a guarantee we will update this information as soon as we know more we apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your patience we sincerely hope you will continue to be mountain house customers in the future
337180 the government just came in and said theyre buying it they did pay for it
337181 they took it and no one else could have it
337182 we dont know why the feds then went to freeze dried companies and bought most of their canned stock
337183 we are currently out of stock on our cans we are not selling any of our cans
337184 we do sell to the government but it is not the reason for company sales limits
337185 we dont have shelters that are being stocked with food were not doing this for the public my only conclusion is that theyre stocking up for themselves
337186 unprecedented demand cleans out major storable food supplier through 2009
337187 it came to our attention today that the worlds largest producer of storable foods mountain house is currently out of stock of all 10 cans of freeze dried foods not just the turkey tetrazzini they will not have product now through 2009
337188 this information was learned by a mountain house dealer who shared it with me this morning
337189 mountain house claims this situation is due to a backlog of orders which may very well be true but who is purchasing all of their food this is a massive global corporation
337190 one idea the military tensions are ramping up with iran and news segments debate whether or not we will implement a preemptive strike in conjunction with israel
337191 i think that families should be prepared for times of crisis whether its a man made disaster or a natural disaster and i think its wise and prudent to stock up on food
337192 if you get into a situation where fuel supplies are disrupted or even if the power grid were to go down for short periods of time people can work around that
337193 but you cant work around a lack of food people starve people panic and you end up with chaos in the streets
337194 we have more than a three year supply of food here
337195 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
337196 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
337197 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
337198 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
337199 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
337200 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
337201 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
337202 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
337203 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
337204 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
337205 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
337206 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
337207 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
337208 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
337209 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
337210 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
337211 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
337212 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
337213 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
337214 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
337215 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
337216 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
337217 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
337218 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
337219 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
337220 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
337221 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
337222 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
337223 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
337224 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
337225 there are worrying signs appearing in the united states where some locals are beginning to hoard supplies
337226 were told that the feds bought the entire container of canned butter when it hit the california docks somethings up
337227 the government just came in and said theyre buying it they did pay for it
337228 they took it and no one else could have it
337229 we dont know why the feds then went to freeze dried companies and bought most of their canned stock
337230 reaching agreement with the palestinians during the time he has left
337231 we decided today that we are going to continue pursuing to reach an agreement before the end of the year
337232 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
337233 what horrifies me most are not radicals cheering terrorist samir kuntar but that most relative moderates feel compelled to do so at the airport to greet him were leaders of lebanons anti syrian anti iranian druze and christian groups as well as the ambassadors from egypt jordan the uae and morocco to avoid being discredited relative moderates must affirm that anyone who murders israeli children is a hero
337234 in just a few months israel will be stronger and better prepared in its defenses against long range missiles
337235 we view this as a serious and drastic move toward the fruition of extremist organizations to establish a temple in place of al aksa mosque
337236 students in higher education are the future leaders of their communities yet significant numbers of them appear to hold beliefs which contravene liberal democratic values in addition there are signs of growing religious segregation on campus these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said that there is no extremism in british universities
337237 watch what you do because i know if you are lying
337238 you can get gps technology when you are in a golf cart playing on a golf court but we are not utilizing gps technology to protect our children theres something seriously wrong here
337239 i think if they knew that we have almost a thousand sexual predators where we have no idea where they are at we cant find them in pennsylvania they would be outraged
337240 a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and timing of ones children
337241 it seems that nothing not rising energy prices not sanctions aimed at its more unsavory business partners not even the prospect of a nuclear iran can curb its thirst for oil
337242 we view this as a serious and drastic move toward the fruition of extremist organizations to establish a temple in place of al aksa mosque
337243 this is a pure provocation by an organization that is exploiting any opportunity to incite the arab public to violence against israel
337244 every time they are looking for some other excuse to incite and now they found it in the course
337245 you can get gps technology when you are in a golf cart playing on a golf court but we are not utilizing gps technology to protect our children theres something seriously wrong here
337246 i think if they knew that we have almost a thousand sexual predators where we have no idea where they are at we cant find them in pennsylvania they would be outraged
337247 i think that college is a period of life where youre seeking many things in the process of maturing
337248 i think that having a sense that theres something larger than ourselves but not necessarily wanting to be tied up to a particular set of rites and rituals is a very logical stage in ones general intellectual seeking
337249 well what does atheism have to offer its by definition a zero so if youre curious why wouldnt you look into anything you could look into before you settled on the most negative one
337250 were losing so much of the great thought and theology that has developed over centuries
337251 in american society weve relied much less on religious education so fewer young people and young adults are getting education in a particular faith
337252 the education they are receiving at all levels is much more secularized than what was traditionally provided young people continue to have a sense of the divine but very little by way of religious formation
337253 in just a few months israel will be stronger and better prepared in its defenses against long range missiles
337254 it was important for the americans to understand our stance and its derivatives and i think they understand this better now after this visit
337255 the systems will vastly improve israels defense and its abilities against the iranian threat
337256 you can be sued and lose a lot of money you could even go to jail if you interfere electronically with my communications
337257 there is security software that will detect the presence of these packages on your phone
337258 i wouldnt want people to be listening to my conversation
337259 its not a spying technique for me as much as it is an ability to get to her if shes in trouble or if she shows up missing
337260 watch what you do because i know if you are lying
337261 if they feel that theyre running into the offender far too often it might be a good idea to find somebody to enlist some sort of counter surveillance equipment to see if theres any signal being emitted from the vehicle
337262 in the camps we emphasize the need to unite and put an end to the internal struggles
337263 it seems that nothing not rising energy prices not sanctions aimed at its more unsavory business partners not even the prospect of a nuclear iran can curb its thirst for oil
337264 in many ways there has been a role reversal for the u s and china while china had originally fueled revolutionary change through sponsoring anti colonial struggles and communist insurgencies it is now the u s that is attempting to fuel change in the region
337265 while the u s has traditionally favored stability even at the cost of supporting unsavory regimes it is now china that increasingly favors stability in the region even if it means supporting pariah regime such as iran
337266 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
337267 national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
337268 i believe the chance of holding new elections is high
337269 not yet clear whether there will be election in three or four months from now
337270 i think it is a proper and responsible decision made at the right time
337271 the only solution to the situation now created is immediate elections waiting any longer for kadima primaries will cause israel more damage
337272 olmerts tenure will be remembered as public bedlam and as a farce of a government
337273 in a democratic state when the prime minister resigns the nation chooses its leader
337274 none of the candidates chosen in kadima will be able to assemble a stable and function government with the current knesset olmert must bring about new knesset elections immediately after the primaries
337275 out of respect for the state of israel i will be happy if olmert succeeds in procing his innocence his resignation is correct and while it is a pity it was done so late better late than never
337276 it is in the countrys interest to form the broadest possible government in order to stabilize the situation and to face the challenges israel can expect
337277 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
337278 its the only good news we have heard from olmert during his tenure
337279 under the current circumstances that exist in the knesset it will be hard to form an alternative coalition and the possibility of an election is still on the agenda
337280 she is the only one worthy of succeeding olmert and former prime minister ariel sharon
337281 an agreed date of new elections should be decided and the knesset should be dissolved during the summer break
337282 the personal decision was not simple but it was correct kadima must continue to act in a way that will preserve its unity and ability to lead
337283 it proves that despite his personal crisis he see what is good for the state and in this difficult hour he has made the right decision
337284 kadima members now have a heavy responsibility to pick the next prime minister i know they will take this responsibility seriously
337285 correct and brave decision for the state of israel the kadima movement and himself personally
337286 we call this a sea borne aircraft carrier system which will be based on the northern and pacific fleets
337287 starting with the fourth submarine we will begin modernizing this class
337288 the modernized borei submarines will be the core of russian naval nuclear forces until 2040
337289 we are aspiring not only to introduce new technologies not only to compete with the west but to take completely new steps which would allow us to look at submarine technologies of the middle of the 21st century
337290 what horrifies me most are not radicals cheering terrorist samir kuntar but that most relative moderates feel compelled to do so at the airport to greet him were leaders of lebanons anti syrian anti iranian druze and christian groups as well as the ambassadors from egypt jordan the uae and morocco to avoid being discredited relative moderates must affirm that anyone who murders israeli children is a hero
337291 the only way to prevent another war is to make it clear that should war break out lebanon may be razed to the ground not only will the lebanese government fear it so would hezbollah this will deter the group if it realizes that aggression on its part would result in destruction that would outrage the population and turn it against hezbollah

337294 each act of procreation poses a direct and obvious threat to the guarantee of natural liberty in space
337295 its obligations as a government to protect children and society as a whole from unjustified and destructive behavior
337296 through a society wide process of agreement internalization and normalization a series of
337297 given that law guides our behavior a policy that treats procreation as private is regressive environmentally damaging and peculiarly anti social it teaches us to disregard others and their interests until we have policies that reflect the truly public nature of having children we will encourage irresponsible procreation and all the harm it causes
337298 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
337299 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
337300 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
337301 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
337302 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
337303 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
337304 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
337305 some of us were lucky we had showers before got off the airplane
337306 based on what i know its highly unlikely that those air defense missiles would be in iranian hands any time soon
337307 theres no doubt that the s 300s would make an air attack more difficult
337308 but theres an answer for every counter measure and as far as were concerned the sooner the iranians get the new system the more time we will have to inspect the deployments and tactical doctrines theres a learning curve
337309 the minimum work up time to be comfortable with the system is six months but more time is preferable

337336 plenty of young side stage acts were worth the gas prices to go there but if this years attendance figures were telling down to 16 000 from 20 000 last year it might behoove warpeds bookers to rethink what constitutes punk rocks elite in 2008
337337 the warped tour is a strange combination of progressive politics and corporate sponsorship it oftentimes resembles an outdoor mall but it was founded as an outlet for all kinds of dramatic soaring pop punk it is intense and goofy a musical version of puberty
337338 i dropped in for about 3 hours in the afternoon and caught all or parts of a dozen acts standouts included against me the florida foursome that made the most of its half hour on the highway 1 stage singer guitarist tom gabel and crew pounded out eight songs in the kind of torrid emphatic fashion one would expect from a band that brings a clash like sophistication and conviction to its songs about social ills and calls to action
337339 keeping healthy was key for the bands as well as the fans animos lead singer schuyler ankele said he forces himself to drink two gallons every day jesse wagner from the aggrolites and derek sanders from mayday parade said hanging out in their air conditioned rvs and tour buses were saving their lives
337340 the best advice for warped virgins is bring sunscreen and money for gatorade expect to make friends with people you wouldnt have expected to and maybe even meet some famous dudes the tour has changed quite a bit from the mohawks and safety pins it now accommodates a more diverse crowd but it still has clung to its respectable roots
337341 they didnt ask for music but thats where it went

337345 without really even trying to create a viral type success we did and now of course were going to try and convince people we meant to do that all along

337356 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
337357 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
337358 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
337359 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
337360 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
337361 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
337362 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers

337381 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
337382 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
337383 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
337384 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

337411 if he was a part of the program we tried to be a part
337412 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
337413 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
337414 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
337415 with that kind of track record sen mccain should be the last person lecturing sen obama about a commitment to quality education for our nations children
337416 i think the united states of america has reached the point where we should provide equal economic opportunity for all americans
337417 that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone

337419 it would have been nice to see him compare and contrast himself less with obama but focus more on his positions

337430 for six months the chancellor has been trying to cannibalize criswell college to fund his building program at the church which will cost 170 to 240 million
337431 furthermore the chancellor has stated and started a plan to stack the criswell college board with trustees that will go along with his plan to liquidate college assets including our campus and kcbi for the financial benefit of the church
337432 neither the deacons nor i have any plan to sell kcbi or the campus of criswell college period
337433 given that our church building committee just engaged an architect i find it strange that dr johnson would claim to know how much our building project which is still several years away is going to cost this along with the alleged plan to sell college assets is just another example of dr johnsons overactive imagination
337434 unfortunately everything mr washburn says is true and much more

337688 with this resolution we take up an effort that began more than 150 years ago when visionary women came together to stand up for womens rights to better the status of women in our society in this tradition more than 11 years ago i first introduced the legislation that we consider this morning the paycheck fairness act and i cannot help but think of all the aprils we have commemorated equal pay day without legislative movement but today the legislative inertia we have experienced for years have come to an end the wage gap is real over the course of her lifetime a female high school graduate will make 700 000 less than the young man she graduates with compared to a man a female college graduate stands to lose up to 2 million in the course of her career this is true across the board
337689 we believe that good government is based on the individual and each persons ability dignity freedom and responsibility must be honored and recognized
337690 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
337691 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
337692 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
337693 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
337694 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
337695 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
337696 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
337697 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
337698 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
337699 youre not going to get any information like this students are always afraid of hurting the patient dont be afraid
337700 on a personal level jim is more wisconsin than washington think fishing family beer and the green bay packers
337701 i cant stand this arrogant obnoxious know it all sonafagun
337702 its break time are you gonna fuggin talk about work during the gd gosh darn entire break
337703 this council cannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred throughout the conflict in darfur
337704 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
337705 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not
337706 if melinda had any information nancy grace stopped the investigation in its track
337707 the iraqi government calls upon all parties and factions to be calm wise and to resort to the constitution
337708 the question of power has been settled by the elections
337709 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
337710 a media ma ana del mi rcoles me llamaron desde la sierra para avisarnos que hab a llovido sangre
337711 se ven cosas inexplicables por eso uno no puede aventurar a dar hip tesis lo que estamos haciendo es esperar a que el sacerdote mande a quibd capital de choc la muestra del l quido
337712 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
337713 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
337714 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
337715 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
337716 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
337717 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
337718 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
337719 i promise to press on with reforms working consistently to share the same views as the people
337720 what people want is the replacement of the prime minister
337721 it shows his resolve to tackle pension and economic problems
337722 why do you think we havent been allowed to go after daredevil or luke cage perhaps because we cant stop a
337723 there are a number of cases around the country where deaf people are held in jail and not provided with any means to communicate with people on the outside theyre lost they get lost
337724 its something thats well known in the deaf community something people are afraid of happening to them
337725 the law doesnt require and mr bahl isnt requesting an interpreter at his side 24 hours a day
337726 he didnt ask for an interpreter when police approached the car he just asked to write
337727 have the same kind of access to communication that hearing inmates have
337728 frankly we thought we had accommodated all of his concerns but when all is said and done which included an extensive mediation mr bahl wanted money
337729 it wasnt as if the county wasnt willing to make some sort of small financial offering but his request was very significant and it wasnt in the best interest of what the citizens would expect from us
337730 most of the plaintiffs allegations involve what happened at the jail on the part involving the st paul police department the most important fact is that the jury in the criminal case convicted the plaintiff of obstructing the legal process based upon testimony of independent witnesses its the plaintiff who acted inappropriately not the st paul police department
337731 the bottom line was if the officer had communicated with mr bahl in writing so they could have understood each other he would have given mr bahl a ticket for the red light violation and they would have gone on their way
337732 this didnt have to happen its all because mr bahl wanted to communicate in writing and the officer refused
337733 things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track
337734 over the years pgmas arroyo highest priority programs and rightly so have been in social development economic progress and peace and security these issues constitute the main part of what the united nation member nations pledge to achieve by 2015 under the millennium development goals but overall pgmas actual performance as measured by human development index hdi standards compared to avowed targets leaves still much to be done in her 23 remaining months
337735 they had a good meeting they agreed that the war on terror was one that we needed to fight together because the enemy is going not just after pakistanis but the united states as well and so our joint efforts need to be comprehensive
337736 we continue to work with the pakistanis to try to improve the situation
337737 i dont feel safe nobody knows when the next bomb will go off or be found
337738 i expect something like this to be happening every month or two
337739 the attack has become an end in itself it doesnt have to serve any purpose other than causing deaths
337740 india is being connected to the global terrorist mainstream in a way that it wasnt before
337741 there are substantial home grown networks supporting and carrying out attacks possibly with technical help from overseas
337742 no longer sustainable to claim that there is no home grown threat
337743 what seems to be happening is that the recruiters have managed to relate peoples experience in india of communal violence with the global narrative of muslims being oppressed globally
337744 there is a danger of the indianised jihad spreading to other areas
337745 thats the most important part of the first time you do the two minute drill just as far as getting the personnel group in and everything both sides of the ball so im pleased with the start
337746 the two minute notoriously has been very frustrating in camp
337747 we just cannot score today wed like to have a couple of those balls back
337748 i think were going tonight so hopefully well be able to put some points on the board
337749 theres five or six plays a game where the quarterback has to move his feet to make a play to get those reps in live football or competitive work like that thats outstanding work because thats practical thats very realistic
337750 is he jumping out of there too early i dont see that i see him stepping up playing within his feet playing within his time clock and coming out at the right time i always look at them as quality reps theres nothing that irritates me more than when the quarterback stops and throws the ball in the ground thats a wasted opportunity to practice a play that youre going to see five or six times a game
337751 its something that changes it up gets your mind doing something else it gets repetitive to do the same drill over and over again and nothings different about it
337752 we didnt have any pre snap penalties but we have to execute a little better get off on the count and get on the same page call wise
337753 when you cant hear each other you need to be better with your pointing and your adjustments on the fly
337754 we have tinkered with that in the past thats something that brady has been successful at in his college career and its something that we like to tap into in different personnel groups
337755 after this event today we will raise our own expectations higher than before so that they have to put an end to this restrictive statute in the iaea and the united nations security council
337756 we have everything in the iaea and the safeguards should routinized for all iran should be dealt with like any other country we are committed to the international organizations and the npt we cannot henceforth tolerate any restrictive statute
337757 iran has always supported its family member of the non aligned movement we will be happy if everyday we witness indias progress in different areas including nuclear energy
337758 they are putting up some civilian facilities under a safeguard regime like the us and other weapon states and now india too this is while uranium and plutonium enrichment used for nuclear weapons are outside the control of the iaea therefore this is a serious question
337759 we do not have a single paper for a legally binding instrument to assure nuclear supply therefore there is no assurance and we have a confidence deficit for nuclear fueled reactors
337760 la presi n no se aguantaba la gente de boca quer a que chilavert sea el arquero pero el v lez me ped an una fortuna por el pase
337761 cuando v lez rechaz la oferta ped an 5 millones por el pase sent una alegr a inmensa e inocultable estaba sonriente ante el no entonces me preguntaron de qu me re a y yo le dije que me sacaba un peso de encima al no aceptar la oferta
337762 antes de irme g mez me dijo que sin chilavert boca no iba a ganar nada un visionario

337764 if you look at the mobile world today there are too many operating systems if youre an application vendor it makes no sense or is extremely difficult to think about supporting android symbian palm windows mobile the iphone and so on
337765 we expect that within the next 3 6 months symbian and android will combine to provide a single open source os many of the same sponsors are involved in both initiatives
337766 per our longstanding company policy we do not comment on market rumors what we can say is that the new symbian foundation will provide a platform formed from symbian os and s60 with uiq and moap s technologies integrated available separately under the foundations royalty free license this is expected to take place in the first half of 2009 there are no further plans to integrate other technologies as a truly open initiative google and any party willing to access and or make a contribution to the foundation is welcome to do so and can sign up at www symbianfoundation org
337767 holistic warfare that includes what our doctrine still sees as unconventional and yet is the dominant form of warfare today and into the future irrespective of whether the f 22 should be kept
337768 having only read the title and subtitle of this book
337769 that could change everything for us and the world we inhabit
337770 the kingdom of god is not simply a new belief or doctrine that can be patched into an old way of life it is rather a new way of life that changes everything
337771 the first thing you should do is lock your car
337772 take everything with you or make sure its out of sight
337773 i am certain he will stand up for framingham in such a way that the legislature will better recognize and respect framinghams significant role in the states economy
337774 it is something that i did i have to say that i am responsible
337775 we are going to institute some checks and balances so this doesnt happen again
337776 the warrant closes on a friday and it all must be done by following wednesday
337777 we have to get it into the newspaper and have it posted
337778 just because it wasnt posted we cant say the meeting didnt occur it doesnt mean the votes didnt happen
337779 the question is since the meeting was not posted correctly the authority provided by town meeting is it a valid authority
337780 this is where the issue has arisen bond counsel raised it
337781 there is no reason at any time at any town meeting that town meeting cannot reconsider and rescind any item
337782 it will ask for the town meeting to validate ratify and confirm the votes
337783 but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
337784 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
337785 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
337786 urkel left his 22 year old girlfriend is having a baby

337789 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
337790 sugammadex represents the first major pharmaceutical innovation in the field of anesthesia in two decades we remain committed to bringing this important medical advance to those who are waiting for it in the united states and plan to work with the agency to address the issues which are primarily related to hypersensitivity allergic reactions
337791 we expect the convenience and readiness of the intravenous bags to significantly complement and build upon the market success of the cardene i v ampoules
337792 with the addition of the ready to use bags the breadth of our cardene product offerings has expanded greatly and we foresee opportunities for wider utilization of this anti hypertensive across a range of acute care settings
337793 this is a particularly exciting event for ekr because many of us were part of the original team at esp pharma that identified acquired and relaunched cardene i v ampoules on what has since proved to be a road of successful growth
337794 oh hai i have five million dollars in the bank

337804 no busco la presidencia con la idea de que he sido bendecido con semejante grandeza que la historia me ha llamado a salvar mi pa s en momentos dif ciles

337835 la ministra fern ndez tiene que explicar dos cosas uno por qu se ha cambiado el r gimen penitenciario y segundo por qu raz n le achac esa responsabilidad al tribunal que est juzgando el caso fujimori
337836 creo que fern ndez ha pretendido desinformar a la opini n p blica y achacarle una responsabilidad al tribunal cuando sabe perfectamente que eso no es competencia de este que al igual que cualquier autoridad judicial tiene facultades para variar un r gimen penitenciario
337837 eso no lo conoc a y no fue expuesto en el juicio lo que me hace aumentar las sospechas que tengo si no se pidi a este tribunal fue al inpe por lo que la ministra deber a saber eso tiene que dar una explicaci n al respecto
337838 he cre do conveniente quedar en libertad para no avalar este tipo de inconductas que han ocurrido sobre todo en la elecci n de la mesa directiva donde no se han respetado los acuerdos hemos aparecido con dos candidaturas cada uno ha votado como ha querido as que no tiene mucho sentido permanecer en un grupo que no tiene disciplina y que no respeta los acuerdos
337839 la primera impresi n que tuve fue muy buena hay buenos jugadores de nivel de selecci n como marko ciurlizza y ernesto arakaki

337846 the moxon is especially attractive to hams who want to avoid purchasing more expensive towers and rotors and desire a directional antenna
337847 the oklahoma education associations proposed constitutional amendment would require major reductions in crucial needs such as roads public safety and health care programs increased taxes or both
337848 its completely unnecessary the legislature has provided record setting appropriations for schools for several years in a row including significant teacher pay increases and our commitment to education remains strong
337849 we recently lowered income taxes and raised the standard deduction for working families and retirees to reverse course at a time when oklahomans are facing 4 gas would create a real hardship for many
337850 oklahoma roads are in desperate need of repair and the eight year plan approved this year will be imperiled if the oeas constitutional amendment is adopted
337851 how will it help our economy to put more money into schools if our roads look like a minefield and our bridges are on the verge of collapse
337852 there are about 25 000 inmates in oklahoma prisons and contrary to the urban legends those men arent non violent offenders theyre murderers rapists child molesters and drug dealers
337853 recklessly cutting our public safety budget would literally endanger lives
337854 its this simple the states the oea cites as models closed rural schools
337855 and since the oea plan is very similar to the arkansas initiative that led to the consolidation of 57 schools its hard to believe they dont expect the same thing to happen in oklahoma reducing educational opportunity does not help oklahoma children we need to support our schools not close them
337856 were ready ready to go for it try something new in mid county
337857 what they dont realize is were not strippers trying to cause a problem were here just to give something new to women of this community
337858 even oprah had a show not too long ago about pole fitness it is a major way to grow leg strength arm strength and upper body plus confidence
337859 they should walk in the doors and see what im about see what my studios about and what were trying to bring here before they judge us
337860 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
337861 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
337862 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
337863 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
337864 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
337865 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
337866 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
337867 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
337868 due process of the law would continue its course and police investigation into the sodomy by anwar would continue till its affirmed
337869 we must not forget saiful and the pain in the arse
337870 we must carry out our responsibility so that saifuls claims are brought to the court for a decision in the name of justice
337871 the rule of law meant a judiciary that was independent from the government of the day and not subservient to it
337872 but they will not come to nations that treat the rule of law as an optional extra or even worse as an impediment
337873 the rule of law also meant laws that were clear could be understood and applicable
337874 it means rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair
337875 while the rule of law was an arbiter and a guide it was also fallible
337876 its inadequacies were not born of corruption or malice and its errors paled in comparison to its virtues
337877 though in exceptional circumstances that it is possible to have the rule of law without true democracy it is impossible to have true democracy without the rule of law
337878 the truth is that people can be indifferent to the rule of law except when their own freedom is in jeopardy
337879 im sorry our president is an idiot i did not vote for him
337880 darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy
337881 and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see
337882 this past off season i worked very hard and you can see it paying off coach has seen it
337883 i was running around out there with my head cut off
337884 the coaches did a great job of just giving me basic things to do they told me that it was ok and to be patient
337885 but it was good to get that experience as a rookie
337886 i forget which day it was but it was an interception he had
337887 the day before he had been beaten on that he had to learn from the day before that it was going to be some type of x isolation route so thats what he processed thats why he got the jump that he got on it and that to me is real progress
337888 he wants to go against the toughest guy all the time the toughest route all the time putting himself in those hard situations so that when he faces them in a game theyre not as hard
337889 is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all
337890 particular piece of land should belong to one man more than another
337891 in cases of need all things are common property so that there would seem to be no sin in taking anothers property for need has made it common
337892 wealth is like manure it works best when it is spread but stinks when it is in one big pile
337893 el gobierno de venezuela nos ayud con la captura de gabriel culma ortiz a quien el grupo terrorista de las farc hab a designado como sustituto de alias c sar

337898 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
337899 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
337900 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
337901 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
337902 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
337903 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
337904 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
337905 educational interactive board game perfect for a classroom setting a wonderful resource for homeschooling families this is a game geared toward middle and high school students
337906 esta es una camiseta que quiero por eso mi decisi n fue siempre quedarme en el club aunque en alg n momento me gustar a pasar a europa

337910 if this movie is so funny why is it ranked only at 100
337911 you cant always get what you want but if you try sometime you might just find you get what you need
337912 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
337913 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
337914 sorry but im very busy at the moment i just want to check some enquiries

338497 call me ishmael some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats off then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me

338500 chris nolan had always wanted to work in the imax format because it offers such stunning image quality its still too cost prohibitive to shoot full movies like this in imax the cameras tend to be noisy i dont believe anyone has found a way to properly blimp an imax camera so chris settled on shooting four major action scenes natively on imax negative imax shots are typically slow sequences with largely stationary cameras but in order to shoot these scenes as we would with 35mm we had to do some things that have never been done before with an imax camera this included some steadicam work and even a couple of handheld shots we may have been the first film to ever do this
338501 heath was one of the nicest actors ive known we worked on a small australian indie film called
338502 i started out as an assistant editor and went back and forth between sound and picture in australia work is more stop and start and i learned that if i worked with both i was consistently employed other editors who seemed to concentrate on one or the other werent working as much i never really saw a big difference between the two and as a picture editor i work heavily with sound i produce a very dense soundtrack in the avid to make the screenings as full as possible i will ask for elements from the sound department and get any effects or music elements that i need i also make use of wild tracks if theres camera noise in a shot ill ask for wild lines to be recorded on set and will cut those in to make the scene work
338503 we had discussed working in hd but these older systems are very rock solid with a movie of this complexity i didnt want to throw in additional variables like a new system or new software im interested in working in hd because we use projectors in the cutting room but then you also have to telecine the negative to hd we were using workprint because theres still concern for risking the negative in the telecine process doing an hd transfer of the workprint isnt as good as coming from the negative so it negates the advantages of hd a little but maybe on the next film
338504 i really like working on nonlinear systems and would never want to go back to the moviolas and kems that i started on on the other hand i cut pretty much the same way as i did on film so i havent used some of the advanced avid features like scriptsync i still think in conventional film terms and typically dont rely on digital tricks like a blow up or an invisible split screen to fix an editing challenge you should always cut for a reason and in my case i fixate on the story theres always a way to cut a scene so that it works and moves the story along you just have to look for the right options and modern nles make it possible to do just that after all you have instant access to a million feet of film right at your fingertips
338505 look ive seen the polling i realize youve been sold on this stupid idea so fine if it makes you happy i promise ill give it a serious look

338537 are you a fashion victim or a fashion assassin get dressed to kill in tres jolie
338538 are unlike other animals you may hit with your car a deer having long legs and most of its body mass a few feet off the ground will pop up over your hood or since its not very heavy itll bounce off of your bumper without causing too much damage a possum or raccoon will go beneath your vehicle and youll feel a small bump nothing more in both of these cases youre pretty safe
338539 will not go over your hood or under your wheels if you hit a pig youll hit it square on now your average pig can weigh anywhere from 200 to 1 000 pounds and when you combine that with the velocity of your car
338540 wham its like hitting a brick wall youre gone youre just gone
338541 you just listen or ill take you right to the closest minimum security orphanarium and dont think i cant explain my reasons to your mother im gifted with words and horribly persuasive
338542 and yes its about the zombie owl i dont care if youve heard it before if you want to drink coca cola until youre silly with sugar and caffeine youll be quiet and let me tell the story
338543 anyway like i was saying night like tonight same stretch of road and oh yeah around this very same bend it was two in the morning and i was in my big chevy diesel pickup truck coming home from a gig
338544 the truck where you spilled an entire 32 ounce strawberry pineapple smoothie right into the pocket of the drivers side door
338545 yeah thats the one now shut up like i was saying as i came around that bend right back there i was suddenly confronted with an image i will never forget a pure snowy white owl with a wingspan as wide as my truck stood in the middle of the road stooped over eating probably a person it could have been a vampire he was eating which might explain his unwillingness to die you know like a transfer of powers where through eating the flesh of a vampire the owl gains the ability to come back from the grave what do you think
338546 well anyway he was stooped over eating and when my headlights hit him he spread his wings out to take flight and thats right when i hit him head on
338547 he bounced right over my hood and right by my open drivers side window and i could swear i caught a glimpse of a blood and gore encrusted beak and some enormous talons but i cant be sure he crashed over my truck with a few weighty thumps and i came to a screeching halt i pulled over and got out taking my big ol metal flashlight with me to see if against odds the owl was still alive and i could put it into my truck bed and save its life i envisioned myself bringing this great big possibly endangered snowy white owl into the animal emergency room just in time to save its life id visit it occasionally during its healing process and there would be an article in the local paper detailing my compassion and heroism possibly id receive a medal im just saying
338548 it could happen so i walked back along the road to the point where id hit the thing and there it was no not the owl a pile of white feathers with blood on them the owl was nowhere to be found and neither was the carcass id seen it chewing on nothing else i was confused and horrified had it dragged itself away into the bushes next to the road had is flown away on twisted broken wings had a lurking predator made off with the fresh owl and its meal i mean what the hell had just happened
338549 yeah thanks anyway i got back into my truck and drove home when i got out of my truck i had the bright idea to check out my bumper to see if there was blood or anything to prove my story to the wife any evidence and there was wedged right into the gap between my headlight and its frame there were white down feathers the frame around the headlight was broken too cracked through the plastic the headlight was fine though
338550 so as i was checking out the feathers i heard the most blood curdling screech right behind me coming from the direction of my front door then a sound of something scraping against the wood shingles of my roof something evil then whatever it was that was on my roof fell off and landed in the bushes so i did what came naturally to me i got the fuck in my house and shut the door
338551 hey you cant say the f word around me im an impressionable youth
338552 what are you like thirteen now i can say the f word you cant thats life buddy its a double standard
338553 im just kidding you can say sucks all you want i dont give a shit so i got into the house and told the wife all about it and she listened to the story half asleep she said it probably just dragged itself into the bushes and shes probably right but heres the thing ever since that night ive heard probably about once a month at least that hideous screech that id never heard before i can practically see him out there creeping around in the dark on broken ragged wings his rotted feathers crawling with worms his eye sockets hollow and his beak gleaming and sharp as a razor he rises every night and roams the countryside attacking people who resemble me and old chevy trucks hoping to one day sink his beak into my throat and when he eventually does then he will finally rest and ill be dead the only person on earth to have been killed by a bloody vengeful owl
338554 he told me the one about the zombie owl again

338558 we have to buy our water each container is worth a peso 2 26 us cents
338559 i miss my mother i have not seen her since march
338560 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
338561 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
338562 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
338563 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
338564 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
338565 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
338566 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
338567 magic mirror on the wall who is the fairest one of all
338568 and now were going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story

338573 some are born great some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them and then there are others
338574 i keep my ideals because in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart
338575 how wonderful that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world
338576 the best remedy for those who are afraid lonely or unhappy is to go outside somewhere where they can be quiet alone with the heavens nature and god because only then does one feel that all is as it should be
338577 think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy
338578 the final forming of a persons character lies in their own hands
338579 and finally i twist my heart round again so that the bad is on the outside and the good is on the inside and keep on trying to find a way of becoming what i would so like to be and could be if there werent any other people living in the world
338580 i dont think of all the misery but of all the beauty that remains
338581 i must uphold my ideals for perhaps the time will come when i shall be able to carry them out
338582 who would ever think that so much can go on in the soul of a young girl
338583 we all live with the objective of being happy our lives are all different and yet the same
338584 by thinking no one can ever get worse but will only get better

338596 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
338597 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
338598 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
338599 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
338600 flashpoint at a dominant 7 64 million viewers and a 1 8 rating 6 share among adults 18 49 at 10 p m and excellent retention out of encore lead in csi viewers 1 7 94 million a18 49 3 1 8 5 at 9 p m there is every reason to now believe the broadcast networks will rely more on quality canadian programming in the future
338601 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
338602 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
338603 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
338604 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
338605 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
338606 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
338607 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
338608 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy

338686 from the heart arise unknowable impulses as well as conscious feelings moods and wishes the heart too has its reasons and is the center of perception and understanding finally the heart is the seat of the will it makes plans and comes to good decisions thus the heart is the central and unifying organ of our personal life our heart determines our personality and is therefore not only the place where god dwells but also the place to which satan directs his fiercest attacks it is this heart that is the place of prayer the prayer of the heart is a prayer that directs itself to god from the center of the person and thus affects the whole of our humanness

338742 if you have expectations especially in this town youre gonna get let down i learned that long ago
338743 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
338744 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
338745 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
338746 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
338747 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
338748 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
338749 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
338750 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
338751 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
338752 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
338753 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
338754 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
338755 that too did not involve purchasing of assets it was more on emolument and logistical needs to carry out works for the elections
338756 these assets were bought directly and did not involve any contract
338757 there was also no purchase of vehicle dogs or uniform as reported in the media
338758 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
338759 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
338760 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
338761 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
338762 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
338763 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
338764 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
338765 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
338766 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
338767 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
338768 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
338769 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
338770 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
338771 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
338772 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
338773 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
338774 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
338775 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
338776 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
338777 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
338778 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
338779 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
338780 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
338781 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
338782 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
338783 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
338784 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
338785 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
338786 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
338787 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
338788 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
338789 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
338790 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
338791 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
338792 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
338793 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
338794 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
338795 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
338796 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
338797 who are open to doing something on the production side
338798 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
338799 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
338800 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
338801 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
338802 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
338803 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
338804 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
338805 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
338806 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
338807 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
338808 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
338809 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
338810 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
338811 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
338812 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
338813 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
338814 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
338815 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
338816 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
338817 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
338818 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
338819 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
338820 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
338821 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
338822 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
338823 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
338824 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
338825 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
338826 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
338827 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
338828 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
338829 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
338830 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
338831 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
338832 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
338833 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
338834 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
338835 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
338836 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
338837 i would say that theres been a its just been interesting to watch i would say that theres been a its just been interesting to watch and interesting to participate with people i mean the taiwan issue was a very touchy issue for a while causing me to say in the oval office that which is now well chronicled that the united states does not support a unilateral declaration of independence because i wanted to make sure that our message was clear but also that the relationship was in a way not our relationship but others relationship with china was in a way that it could evolve peacefully and constructively
338838 here at tweaktown i often get questions about whether or not blu ray x will work in an australian or american blu ray player so i thought it would be a good time to write a guide about blu ray importing lets begin similar to dvd region coding where the world is split up into six geographic regions blu ray is split into three geographic regions fortunately unlike dvd the splitting of blu ray regions are far more sensible

338858 to pray is to descend with the mind into the heart and there to stand before the face of the lord ever present all seeing within you
338859 from the heart arise unknowable impulses as well as conscious feelings moods and wishes the heart too has its reasons and is the center of perception and understanding finally the heart is the seat of the will it makes plans and comes to good decisions thus the heart is the central and unifying organ of our personal life our heart determines our personality and is therefore not only the place where god dwells but also the place to which satan directs his fiercest attacks it is this heart that is the place of prayer the prayer of the heart is a prayer that directs itself to god from the center of the person and thus affects the whole of our humanness

338927 rage se ver peor en xbox360 por culpa de la falta de espacio
338928 el juego se ver bastante peor en xbox 360 en comparaci n a ps3 por culpa de las limitaciones de almacenamiento
338929 lo que ha dicho john carmack es una simplificaci n un poco bestia
338930 nos preocupa que la versi n para xbox 360 de rage resulte demasiado cara por culpa de lo que costar a una producci n a m ltiples discos
338931 hay un grave problema de espacio en disco con 360 y si no podemos encontrar una manera adecuada de arreglarlo o conseguir que microsoft lo arregle a pesar de que pensemos que la consola de microsoft tiene mejor hardware la limitaciones de espacio podr an significar una menor densidad y resoluci n en las texturas en comparaci n claro est a su rival ps3
338932 adem s el problema no es que el juego sea demasiado grande es que los desarrolladores perdemos casi 2 gb de espacio en el disco debido a la informaci n adicional que microsoft nos obliga a poner
338933 hemos pensado casi en todo instalar en disco duro no podemos por que no todos los usuarios de xbox 360 tienen uno instalado streaming de determinados complementos del juego en tiempo real no podemos por lo mismo y por que adem s no todo el mundo tiene la consola conectada a internet seguimos pensando los problemas est n claros y estamos trabajando codo con codo junto a microsoft para intentar arreglarlos de la mejor manera posible

338937 substantially all ideas are second hand consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing it takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph or a steam engine or a phonograph or a photograph or a telephone or any other important thing and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others he added his little mite that is all he did
338938 you might get the odd clear day but im sure the smog cloud just blew over some other city or the country side

338976 its kind of like everything weve done has been criticized and unfairly because its not even been allowed to play out

339019 warum haben sie das getan sie hatten keine finanzprobleme und nichts
339020 ich habe das geld abgezweigt um meiner damaligen freundin m bel zu kaufen ich habe ihr mit dem geld die ganze wohnung eingerichtet
339021 ja ich war so bl d ich war frisch mit ihr zusammen und da habe ich mein hirn ausgeschaltet
339022 das kann ich nicht sagen weil ich nicht einmal mehr in die wohnung hinein darf f r die ich m bel gekauft habe
339023 there are a lot of raised eyebrows even more so now i know very few people here friends in law enforcement that buy this story like the rest of the world has ive been doing search and rescue for 14 years fossett should have been found its not like we didnt have our eyes open we found six other planes while we were looking for him were pretty good at what we do
339024 what ive strived to find out is what happened to this man in the run up to his disappearance why did he disappear
339025 i spoke to people who were on the scene people who were helping out with the search efforts anyone whom i thought could shed some light on this and what i discovered is that there is absolutely no proof that steve fossett is actually dead
339026 im not a conspiracy theorist im a man who deals in facts and i dont really care if he is alive or dead it makes no difference to me what i am interested in is the truth and a proper criminal investigation of this mans disappearance was never undertaken by law enforcement or officials in the state of nevada
339027 we dont want to speculate lets stick to the facts
339028 thats what we pilots do facts count not speculations steve had fuel for four hours and flew at 100mph those are the facts
339029 here is a guy who owns over 100 land and air speed records hes got electronic toys satellite locators all kinds of safety devices coming out of his ears and we are meant to believe he got into that plane without anything it goes against everything hes ever done
339030 but people at the highest level of government have got involved in this search and they have used every ploy known to man to find him or his plane and they havent turned up a thing and if you speak to them you will find some very suspicious people
339031 i deal in a lot of probate cases involving very large estates and nothing ever happens fast in them but that guy got declared dead in world record time it just doesnt add up
339032 i cant i mean i dont have a reason we searched what we could and in what we did search we just couldnt find what we were looking for
339033 but i would say that the terrain makes it very difficult each mountain can have a hundred gullies and each gully you have to go over very slowly people can go missing there for years in fact in the fossett search we discovered at least two other airplanes which had gone down years earlier
339034 as someone who has a certain experience of the terrain i was surprised by just how tough going it was
339035 each peak has up to a hundred canyons and you really have to trawl each one to be sure theres nothing there
339036 we had two men working either top of a canyon a couple on each slope and one person at the bottom
339037 that plane was not encased in metal it was not big it was a steel cage encased in fabric that wouldnt reflect the light and if it came down in forest you would struggle to see it from the air
339038 i dont believe the myths he was a man of integrity not all of us are perfect all of us have issues but i think he was a man of his word
339039 to those who say that things about the trip were strange i would say this fossett was going on a pleasure flight he wasnt actually experienced in flying a small plane and he wasnt flying a model he normally flew so there was no reason why he should be particularly adept and no reason the crash shouldnt have happened his final journey was like taking a corvette around the block for a spin
339040 a number of canyons in the area are effectively dead ends once you fly into them they arent wide enough to turn in and if you cant climb at the 500ft a minute you would need to exit by carrying on in a straight line you are basically doomed once you get into them

339113 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity
339114 this social and cultural project aims to construct a secular society without any moral or religious reference attempting to impose nihilist thought and deliberately eliminating everything catholic from public life
339115 powerful and sometimes dark forces present everywhere from the media to schools

339140 lets see you all believe that he black shirt man should not stand close to her nielsen
339141 yet she pointing to blue shirt lady is standing very close to him why is that
339142 so you all feel that she blue shirt lady is justified in doing what you consider to be wrong standing too close if it is done in a noble cause protecting someone is that the deal
339143 but youd still be doing what you believe is wrong
339144 she cant just walk up to me and make me move five feet away its a public street
339145 you all are just children pulling pigtails and i am your babysitter
339146 he learnt the destructive arts of his trade from karl rove rofl can you feel the love
339147 democratic strategists said it was a classic rove tactic of taking an opponents positive and turning it into a negative
339148 of course theyll still vote republican where else are they going to go
339149 most americans know in their gut that weve got to change
339150 but the reason they spend all their time talking about me is they just dont have any new ideas
339151 because of his age his inexperience his race even his name
339152 ive often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history
339153 for too many americans the dream of opportunity is slipping away thats why the decisions we make over the next few years will shape a generation if not a century
339154 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
339155 all of those negative ads that hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices
339156 the fact is these washington tactics do the american people a disservice by trying to distract us from the very real challenges that we face
339157 because it provided the biggest boost to alternative energy including wind power for example which has gone up a huge amount as a consequence of the credits in there
339158 held hostage by the desire of the oil companies to do more drilling
339159 what caused that is that people cant afford to drive
339160 if we could bring immediate relief to the people simply by opening offshore drilling then i would consider it the truth of the matter is that gives us a few cents saving 10 to 12 years from now
339161 most americans know in their gut that weve got to change
339162 how do you take the second step of showing that even though 90 of the time you hear tell of free markets
339163 vote obama because its good to hurt when you pee
339164 why hasnt it worked i believe its worked quite well when its been tried but with a few honorable exceptions its barely been tried
339165 when i hear stuff like that i get madder than a one armed ayn rand heroine in a face slapping contest
339166 lying hysterically about his opponent and cruising on the medias perception of him as a straight talking maverick to avoid being calle
339167 you know reading for fun isnt supposed to be a chore

339169 he was caught by onsite security and is now not allowed to be on my workplace campus
339170 she was well acquainted with the opportunities and limitations of the law to protect people in a domestic violence situation
339171 how do you take the second step of showing that even though 90 of the time you hear tell of free markets
339172 vote obama because its good to hurt when you pee
339173 why hasnt it worked i believe its worked quite well when its been tried but with a few honorable exceptions its barely been tried

339176 the future of the jews judaism and jewish culture in israel
339177 i am relieved when jewish writers stridently focus on how ridiculous this slur of anti semitism is vis a vis those of us who cannot abide neocons
339178 the goal of the arabs is not the return of occupied territories but rather the destruction of israel
339179 the united states playing an active role in helping the parties to resolve the arab israeli conflict
339180 the united states playing an active role in helping the parties to resolve the arab israeli conflict if it meant the united states publicly stating its disagreements with both the israelis my emphasis and the arabs
339181 the united states playing an active role in helping the parties to resolve the arab israeli conflict if it meant the united states exerting pressure on both the israelis my emphasis and arabs to make the compromises necessary to achieve peace
339182 israel needs all the support it can get but we send the wrong message when jewish organizations form alliances with right wing christian zionists who have their own agenda
339183 it does not bother me when american jews disagree publicly with israeli government policy
339184 israel is less secure as a result of george bushs presidency because america is militarily stuck in iraq we have less credibility and influence across the middle east and iran has become a stronger regional power
339185 we have done everything we can in iraq and must start to bring home u s troops in a responsible way
339186 israel must always maintain its strong military but in the long run israel can only achieve real security through peace agreements that end conflicts and establish internationally recognized borders
339187 unlike george bush who said talking with our iranian enemies would be appeasement i believe america should pursue direct and tough diplomacy that offers incentives for iran to abandon its nuclear program but also includes consequences like damaging financial and international isolation if they refuse to cooperate
339188 a two state solution that declares an end to the palestinian israeli conflict resulting in all arab countries establishing full diplomatic ties with israel and creating an independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza
339189 a two state solution is necessary to strengthen israeli security and ensure israels jewish democratic character
339190 a two state solution is an important national security interest for the united states
339191 israels recent cease fire with hamas has resulted in hamas ending its rocket attacks from gaza into southern israel this agreement between israel and hamas demonstrates that the best path for israel requires non military solutions and negotiations to resolve the disputes with the palestinians
339192 israels recent cease fire with hamas has resulted in hamas ending its rocket attacks from gaza into southern israel this agreement between israel and hamas demonstrates that it is important for israel to negotiate with even its worst enemies my emphasis whether it is directly or through third parties
339193 in exchange for full peace with syria including the establishment of diplomatic relations and security arrangements like those with egypt and jordan and an end to syrian assistance to hamas and hizbullah israel will withdraw from the golan heights to a border agreed upon by both sides
339194 in exchange for full peace including a formal end of conflict with the palestinians and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the arab world israel will withdraw from most of the west bank and dismantle many of the israeli settlements

339417 at one time this was number one place in bkok but the frequency of the dope raids just got too much and everybody moved to the big m single rooms started at 60 baht for single rooms at the atlanta
339418 alot of people have written to warn that hill tribe tours are becoming very commercialised and over done
339419 phukets main drawback is alot of the development seems to be carried out with total disregard for aesthetics or planning
339420 now there are more than a dozen hotels and guesthouses and innumerable restaurants
339421 commercialism starting to catch up with phi phi and there are frequent tours from phuket also

339425 i have finished the lesson plan therefore i have taught
339426 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
339427 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination
339428 the territory government will provide 5 million to support the establishment of the hub and 3 million to support marketing of routes and destinations
339429 the aim of the agreement is to grow the international market and the darwin hub
339430 one of those terrible crimes that will never be solved
339431 i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
339432 those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer
339433 any result like this is always difficult for family members because it re opens all the old wounds
339434 and that line drawn underneath what happened has now disappeared and there is the prospect of at least a review if not a re investigation into the case
339435 a huge thank you to the jury they obviously worked very hard to ensure they correctly interpreted the circumstantial evidence in this case
339436 we hope that the police will now look again into the murder of jill dando
339437 the only reason that the prosecution say that this is the work of the local loner the local nutter the man with these serious psychological problems is because that is the man they arrested
339438 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
339439 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination

339452 weve got to change and start doing the right thing
339453 the u s airline industry as it is constituted today was not built for 125 or 130 per barrel oil
339454 the pilots of southwest airlines want to express our sentiment to herb that it has been an honor and a privilege to be a part of his aviation legacy
339455 im lucky herbie for having all of these years with all of you
339456 when you treat them right then they will treat your outside customers right that has been a powerful competitive weapon for us
339457 we could have made more money if we furloughed people but we dont do that and we honor them constantly our people know that if they are sick we will take care of them if there are occasions or grief or joy we will be there with them they know that we value them as people not just cogs in a machine
339458 herb has done an excellent job of sustaining a high level of employee morale and sticking to their strategy
339459 if he hadnt had the love field advantage the story would have turned out differently
339460 the single focus that has kept southwest on the road to success is that they always knew who their customers were they were people who had to make the choice to either fly or drive
339461 he recognized that good employee relations would affect the bottom line he knew that having employees who wanted to do a good job would drive revenue and lower costs
339462 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
339463 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family
339464 new york city is the epicenter of the world financial industry this makes it a prime target for attackers and the best place to hold the owasp conference owasps contributors are focused on making people aware of the tools and techniques that hackers are using to make cyber crime a multi billion dollar a year industry
339465 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
339466 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
339467 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
339468 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero

339470 tadi malam saya bercinta dengan istriku sebanyak tiga kali pada pagi hari istriku membuatkan sarapan yang sangat lezat untuk menyenangkan hatiku
339471 tidak mau kalah tadi malam aku bercinta dengan istriku enam kali pada pagi hari istriku membuatkan sarapan pagi dan berkata bahwa ia tidak akan bisa mencintai pria lain
339472 wah makasih yah mas tanpa mas saya nggak bakal bisa kencing gini

339476 saya dua minggu lalu jadi saksi ahli kasus jual beli fosil manusia purba sekarang kalau pun ada fosil yang diserahkan tak tertutup juga kemungkinan ada yang menjualnya mungkin ini misal dari dua yang diserahkan lima fosil lolos di internet fosil manusia purba ada yang ditawarkan hingga rp3 miliar

339482 pagi ini kami diberitahu keputusan final komite olimpiade internasional untuk melarang keikutsertaan komite olimpiade irak
339483 saya bersumpah bahwa para atlit yang sudah berlatih mereka menelepon saya hari ini dan mereka menangis dan sangat sedih
339484 theyve got nothing to talk about so they want to fire something up
339485 but youve got to be lucky and dont have the injuries weve had if we dont have the injuries id be very disappointed if we didnt make the playoffs
339486 you rarely see a coach guaranteeing a playoff berth usually its an immature young player who doesnt know what hes talking about
339487 but when a coach says that its a call to all the players and coaches that hey this is what i expect and if you dont do it either im gone or everybody else is going to be gone its a direct challenge to the players to step it up when the coach says that you better do it
339488 hes expecting a lot out of us and at the same time were expecting a lot out of the coaching staff to put us in position to win
339489 thats our goal and we expect nothing less than that
339490 our reports said he learned very well and hes done it
339491 at boise state he had some prerequisites to pass blocking that hes developed even further here
339492 because it takes the judgment out of it it makes it easier on everybody
339493 theres a certain self absorption that comes with whats going on
339494 you really need to focus on what youre doing and get better you cant get caught up in anything other than that
339495 i feel really comfortable outside ive always played outside even in college so its something im used to
339496 i have to work on getting off press coverage a lot better and brandons helping me out with that
339497 weve had a hearing weve had discussions weve got a little more work to do which was actually done friday morning and we should be making a ruling very shortly
339498 first is to understand all the facts to understand all the perspective
339499 so we clearly understand the circumstances in which an incident or incidents occurred
339500 they also understand what i expect of them and i communicate with them what i expect of them as an nfl player
339501 whats up in the memfis camp maybe theres no one who gives a damn besides our friends but since there hasnt been so much activity from us on the live front or the world wide web i feel obligated to share some info about what weve been up to the past few months weve recorded a new album the yet untitled follow up to 2006s debut album the wind up was brought to life at bohus sound studios abba status quo esbj rn svensson trio mustasch in kung lv sweden engineered and produced by fredrik reinedahl burst gadget crowpath opeth and many more and mastered by dragan tanaskovic this beast consisting of 12 tracks shows on a matured and more developed sound im personally very pleased with the outcome since were through with our old label due to reasons that will not be discussed here its not decided yet when or how it will be released time will tell
339502 we got a call from a pretty big guy who wants to be our singer i cant say who that is yet but talks are happening about it and hopefully well see what happens in the next couple of months
339503 no no its a lot cooler than that but i dont know if its going to happen so i cant say its cool that people are calling us and wanting to get in the band so thats exciting
339504 the bible is filled with countless accounts of the power of god
339505 in it we can see how god calmed the sea how he raised the dead and how he healed and fed hundreds but still sometimes people forget that god is still working they forget that god is still doing those things today so to ensure that people understand that the power of god is still working we use testifying in our services
339506 so we use testifying so when someone sits in that pew and hears this they will say that if god can do it for them he can do it for me when this happens we know that a testimony reassures people of gods great work
339507 if someone can get up in a service and proclaim that they were sick to death that the doctors had given up on them and that through the power of prayer and god moving in their life they are healed that reassures somebody in the congregation who has cancer that there is hope for them
339508 now were talking about healing but what about other reasons for testifying
339509 but today people look at me especially those who knew me before i became a pastor and they can ask that if the lord could save him i know he can save me
339510 i find that until god touches their hearts there will always be those the bible says who believes what we do is foolishness and we cant force our belief on people so if there are people in our churches or those outside of our churches that dont believe in the power or the usefulness of testimony they are entitled to that belief but to us who find and who know that this tool works to reassure christians its for us to stay focused and to keep using this instrument so we can build up the faith of our people
339511 usually the only person who knows this is the pastor but when we give opportunity for testimony the whole congregation knows it now and then the bible says we edify all of these things
339512 in the anglican church we dont use testifying in our formal liturgies mainly because its the churchs tradition
339513 but in some parishes during prayer meetings and local services people are encouraged to do that
339514 when we affirm our faith we are testifying to our belief in what the church has always taught this is important and differs from testifying where most emphasis is on a personal experience that people have had and sometimes those experiences dont speak to reality
339515 since the case is being fast tracked the judicial review is one tier and thaksin will have no chance to appeal
339516 saya penasaran dengar di radio dan melihat di tv berita ryan begitu heboh makanya saya sempat sempatkan ke sini
339517 kapan lagi ada seperti ini ya kita abadikan saja mumpung lagi ada di sini
339518 saya penasaran karena di media diberitakan begitu hebat nah sekarang ini mumpung lagi nganggur makanya saya ke sini
339519 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
339520 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
339521 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
339522 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
339523 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
339524 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
339525 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
339526 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
339527 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
339528 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
339529 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
339530 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
339531 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths
339532 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
339533 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and
339534 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
339535 i dont think anyone could have warned us about this this was biblical almost the amount of rain that fell here and the speed at which the river rose while we were standing at it was like something from a movie
339536 i have never witnessed anything like it and i never want to see anything like this again where the centre of the town becomes like an ocean it was absolutely unbelievable just frightening
339537 ive never seen anything like this in my life and i was born and reared here as was my father and grandfather before him
339538 i woke up and looked out and heard beer barrels which had been swept away by the current crashing off walls the water didnt eventually recede until it demolished a wall down the road from me
339539 north cork south tipperary and kilkenny are taking the worst of it now we are not sure how much rain the rivers have taken in these areas so there could be a risk of flooding there
339540 they will eventually clear tomorrow and die out and become more isolated but later in the day and on sunday there will be heavy showers
339541 it was a freak rainfall that hit this particular area with a vengeance ultimately nobody could deal with an act of nature like this but we will be reviewing the services that are in place and when we assess the whole cost to the county council and its going to be a very substantial figure
339542 we will be seeking special funding from the minister of the environment
339543 naturally i was devastated when we came down this morning because we couldnt down before then because the water was so high
339544 we will see a number of failures as there are quite a lot of weak carriers that will not survive we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
339545 what ive been telling people is when i went to denver its like the dog who gets put to the pound and you get a new owner and the loyalty is to that new owner and the owner treats you good
339546 i guess thats the easiest way to explain it the way mr bowlen treated everybody in the organization was unbelievable coming from where i came from they didnt treat people quite as well so you know i thought it was that way across the league and then to go to denver and to have your eyes open like that it was just unbelievable the respect and dignity it just made you want to stay there and it made you want to win for the man
339547 dus het werd tijd om de snor te drukken in la en naar las vegas te gaan

339576 from security through to crm and room inventory management it touches virtually every aspect of a casinos operations
339577 with many new multinationals entering the market macau businesses need to continue to identify ways of differentiating their products or services in order to maintain and grow customer share
339578 businesses across banking casino and the hotel industry invariably are turning to it systems and solutions as a means to improve the delivery quality and cost effectiveness of their products and services
339579 to tap into the opportunity presented by more than 10 new casinos due to launch over the next three to five years
339580 casinos make use of some of the most sophisticated video systems in the world
339581 most casinos have invested millions of dollars in extensive video coverage throughout their properties with high density coverage of the gaming floor many large casinos have several thousand video cameras installed on their properties to do so all controlled from one central command centre
339582 the software can also interface with various casino management systems focused on improving customer service for example video systems can be used to identify areas that need more staff
339583 in many ways the gaming industry is pushing the envelope of technical innovation in surveillance both visual and behavioral
339584 casino surveillance is interesting because within a casino patrons and employees accept levels of surveillance that they would find intrusive elsewhere so casino operators have had a virtually free hand in developing systems to track people and money throughout the casino complex facial recognition is one of the latest innovations as are systems that automatically scan for certain persons or actions
339585 as the competition continues to increase the only way casino resorts can set themselves apart from their competitors is to know more about their guests than their competitors as a result customer intelligence is a critical element in helping casino resorts to understand their guests to know who they are where theyre coming from why theyre here what their likes and dislikes are

339590 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
339591 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
339592 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
339593 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
339594 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
339595 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
339596 gang of 10 five democrats five republicans for their cooperation and broad plan
339597 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem

339600 there is disc space issue on the 360 and if we cant find a clever way or compromise with microsoft to address that issue even though we feel the 360 has superior hardware the size limitations may mean that we may not have as much texture density or resolution on the 360 version
339601 let me be clear this is an open question we have these tech issues and we are working with microsoft to solve them

339631 this is a tactic by the mayor to pressure city council to see if they can get them to agree to the tunnel deal and also pressure on the unions to try to get us to agree to union concessions in our contracts which we will not do
339632 it should not come as a surprise that a notice of impending layoffs was sent to the affected unions mayor kilpatrick has made great strides to ensure that detroit would have a balanced budget in spite of the economic recession facing our region however due to the political posturing of the detroit city council and their lack of concern for city employees and the citys residents the tunnel deal is now stalled leaving a 65 million hole in the citys budget those council members who claimed this would never happen have now been put on notice
339633 he always threatens the chaos theory throw as much chaos and threats out there then down the road try to get a settlement but hes really running out of cards to play in this game

339635 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
339636 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief

339646 people know about artificial intelligence but the perception is that robots are cold and calculating industrial automatons
339647 but over the last decade there has been a new field where robots have become the opposite of that

339674 and its just the same thing with a decimal point
339675 i dont think people are meant to be by themselves thats why if you actually find someone you care about its important to let go of the little things even if you cant let go all the way because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone no matter how many people are around

339685 but if anyone is willing to try something new i think theyd find a sport that is both exciting and challenging
339686 its great because the players become more concerned with treating each other with respect instead of just worrying about winning the game
339687 of course winning matters during the playoffs but the teams are still expected to show good sportsmanship

339689 im near sighted but the doctor at my physical said i was still waiver eligible
339690 i was told that that would happen after getting there
339691 but even though the doctor at the base knew i had a waiver the paperwork was never signed
339692 so i guess the army doesnt care if its soldiers need medical attention if it means filling out paperwork at least i got paid for sitting around for a month
339693 a lot of people in the army wear glasses i still dont see why in my case i had to leave

339702 were pleased with the contribution he makes for our footy club clarkson said
339703 theres a lot of people out there that seem to be displeased with it but were pretty happy with the contribution that he makes
339704 maybe there might be an opportunity for the media to focus on the guys that cant get the footy rather than the guy that can get the footy and then focus on the goalkicking
339705 the way that we look at it he is a very very dangerous forward and what its doing is opposition sides are starting to double team him and thats going to create opportunities for other forwards in the side

339714 theres no doubt in my mind that the act of literally seeing such a word if you can call it that printed in the magazine these ladies have held so dear to their literary hearts for so many years caused their simultaneous heart attacks its a damn shame
339715 they werent as shocked as many of their friends that the new yorker had taken to reviewing popular music so substantively over the last few years

339721 we usually have a house out here that has air conditioning and the guys prefer to go there and cool down
339722 when it gets over 100 degrees theres more risk of becoming dehydrated and not able to cope with those responses

339760 if the powers of concupiscence try to detach the language of the body from the truth the power of love instead strengthens it ever anew in that truth so that the mystery of the redemption of the body can bear fruit in it
339761 love is a power a capacity of the human soul of a theological nature
339762 this love is above all fully human a compound of sense and spirit it is not then merely a question of natural instinct or emotional drive it is also and above all an act of the free will whose trust is such that it is meant not only to survive the joys and sorrows of daily life but also to grow so that husband and wife become in a way one heart and one soul and together attain their human fulfillment

339831 sudan is home to investments by large international companies that are fixtures in many americans mutual funds and retirement plans in recent months an array of efforts have been launched to press companies pension plans and now mutual funds not to do business in sudan the goal is to urge sudans government to find an end to the violence through its mutual funds boston based fidelity is the largest u s holder of american depositary shares in petrochina co a chinese oil giant with sudanese projects u s companies have been prohibited from doing business in sudan since 1997 but it is not illegal for an american firm to own shares in a foreign company doing business there
339832 the united states special envoy to sudan andrew natsios has resigned and will be replaced by illinois republican lawyer and former u s diplomat richard williamson the white house announced on friday
339833 chad has threatened to expel any more refugees from sudans darfur region saying their presence is triggering insecurity and called on the international community to take them away
339834 eufor has a un mandate to protect the 500 000 refugees from darfur but eu commanders suspended deployment during intense fighting in and around ndjamena during the rebel assault
339835 were determined its going to happen and we expect that it will happen this week
339836 the government uses the oil money to buy chinese weapons in darfur
339837 265 000 barrels per day of sudans total output of more than 500 000 barrels per day
339838 the displaced communities have for long time known that the planes which attack their villages are chinese made and that the bombs that flattened their houses and burnt their huts are supplied by china
339839 the systematic and planned extermination of an entire national racial political or ethnic group
339840 we must tell china that enough is enough and our representatives can help leaders in congress are gathering support for an official letter to president hu of china letting him know that his indifference toward darfur is unacceptable
339841 the cruel actions of these capitalist pig dog western left handed shaven zionist puppets will be punished god willing i swear on my camels grave that we will bring this barbershop quartet to justice these poor victims are inconsolable without their facial hair as they no longer look like their mothers
339842 the mass murder taking in place in darfur today to increase pressure on the sudanese government to stop the killing there
339843 during the second world war ordinary civilians stood by and did nothing while millions of jews were taken to the gas chambers
339844 unfortunately this is not the first attack against our troops in mogadishu
339845 but we are as determined as ever to carry out the mandate of the mission this is an attack by elements bent on undermining peace efforts in somalia
339846 if its going to get worse we might be forced out of the country and have to leave the patients behind
339847 the faithful must minimize their carbon footprint as much as they can by doing things like warming their food with a magnifying glass not eating beans and trying not to
339848 i love coming to tournaments and went to six or seven each year the last few years on my own following players i know aaron baddeley for one i wondered what it would be like to go to every event
339849 i do a blog for the pga tour at pgatour com and i interview the players i follow before the tournament and after each round
339850 it takes me about an hour to transcribe eight minutes of tape im not a very fast typist
339851 if your kid has aspergers syndrome or autism its not the end of the world theres still hope
339852 no nos atrevemos a muchas cosas porque son dif ciles
339853 du monde tel quil est et que par d finition nous ne pouvons pas changer
339854 nous sommes condamn s vivre dans le monde o nous vivons
339855 gr ce aux guerres la chirurgie a fait des progr s
339856 cest au reste de la soci t occidentale enfin de souche ceux quon appelle nous les souchiens parce quil faut bien leur donner un nom les blancs qui il faut inculquer lhistoire de lesclavage de la colonisation
339857 tour of the rolling stones grossed over five hundred million dollars in sales contradicting the theory that people will not want to pay for an experience
339858 we can save sound if it doesnt get too hot just think what well be able to do with these things
339859 an hour to 2 hour wait at the dmv because they cut their hours no
339860 i think its making a big difference as far as people using their phones said chp officer vaughn cain
339861 the traffic section began looking at some of the red light violators that are caught on camera and about three of 10 violators were talking on their phones said bpd sgt greg terry the traffic section did the same for the month of july and found about the same amount of violators going through these cameras their phone
339862 in some parts much of africa for a start homosexual and lesbian relations are a taboo in others the united states for example it has become a justice issue
339863 working on something that will have acceptance by the majority of the churches of the communion we will have to make space for those who cant sign up yet
339864 you dont have to join but youre not going to stop us
339865 its a pilgrimage and the document is designed to help people to walk along that road
339866 significant steps are being taken in relationships between the bishops
339867 we might not have reached consensus in fact we certainly havent reached consensus but i believe people are feeling that significant growth is occurring
339868 head to head debates that create winners or losers do not necessarily resolve difficult issues in the life of the church as compared to face to face encounters
339869 its more important to be faithful to the gospel than faithful to each other
339870 we dont see why welcoming the gay or lesbian person into the church must mean blessing what they do in the churchs name for example blessing same sex relationships or accepting them for ordination for example as bishops whatever their lifestyle
339871 acknowledging the spiritual gifts of gay and lesbian believers they will certainly be likely to feel that the restraint you ask for is a betrayal please try to see why this is such a dilemma for many of us
339872 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
339873 what some see as confused or reckless innovation in some provinces the ordination of gene robinson in america for example is felt as a body blow to integrity of mission and as a matter of physical risk to christians to anglicans living tensely with muslim neighbours in northern nigeria for instance
339874 but nor are we like the international lutheran federation were somewhere in the middle
339875 unless we do have something about which we consent which we trust to resolve some of our differences we shall be flying further apart
339876 there have to be protocols and conventions by which we recognise each other as churches and by which we understand and manage exchanges between us
339877 thrust for evangelisation animates both the anglican communion and the roman catholic church
339878 much is spoken today of diseases like alzheimers and parkinsons
339879 by analogy their symptoms can at times be found even in our own christian communities for example when we live myopically in the fleeting present oblivious to our past heritage and apostolic traditions we could well be suffering from spiritual alzheimers
339880 and when we behave in a disorderly manner going whimsically on our own way without any coordination with the head or the other members of our community it could be ecclesial churchlike parkinsons
339881 the great pity is that to have those voices would have been a healing and helpful thing
339882 corporately the american house of bishops asked for forgiveness last year
339883 and 50 of the provinces individual autonomous national anglican churches or a bit more said thats probably all right
339884 the bishops represent not only their dioceses but also the worldwide fellowship and thats the rationale
339885 what counts for me as wrong is any relationship outside a covenant of mutual love and support
339886 i dont think that sex outside marriage is as god purposes it
339887 in the question of same sex relationships the lambeth conference has made its views clear and that is the position i hold as archbishop
339888 getting these oral histories now is important because once they are gone their stories are gone forever
339889 all of them love their country and are here for all the right reasons
339890 the patriotism you see in these people is just phenomenal
339891 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
339892 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
339893 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
339894 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
339895 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
339896 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
339897 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
339898 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
339899 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
339900 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
339901 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
339902 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
339903 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
339904 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
339905 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
339906 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
339907 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
339908 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
339909 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
339910 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
339911 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
339912 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
339913 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
339914 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
339915 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
339916 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
339917 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
339918 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
339919 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
339920 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
339921 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
339922 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
339923 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
339924 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
339925 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
339926 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
339927 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
339928 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
339929 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
339930 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
339931 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
339932 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
339933 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
339934 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
339935 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
339936 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
339937 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
339938 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
339939 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
339940 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
339941 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
339942 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
339943 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
339944 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
339945 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
339946 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
339947 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
339948 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
339949 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
339950 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
339951 i understand all the beautiful people are rushing to see it
339952 it is supposed to expose the dynamics of social power
339953 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
339954 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
339955 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
339956 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
339957 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
339958 this would be the first municipal wind project in utah
339959 it would be a residential scale turbine and the noise would be minimal or nonexistent
339960 we dont have the intention for a full blown wind farm at this time
339961 but there is a possibility for more than one turbine it all depends on the data
339962 the wow factor for me is being able to show people we can actually do it
339963 this gives a third party analysis to what we as staff people were projecting
339964 it is a whole other backup to what we have
339965 with the level of analysis that went into the project and two trail alternatives well thought out and designed we were happy to hear city engineers think the alternatives are pretty good
339966 getting some hard bounces still caving right on our ass
339967 this is at least the third time they have noted walls blown out by caves on the pillar section must be pretty violent
339968 we have used all the tricks we know of to pull these pillars and i no longer feel comfortable we can do it without unacceptable risk
339969 discussed the possibility that management would decide to pull out of the south barrier section due to similarities between the outburst accident that morning and the march 10 events in the north barrier
339970 an absolute sense of helplessness you cant believe anything you hear and only half of what you see thats where i am with mining company owner bob murray and with msha
339971 id like to see those boys get out of there
339972 one of the prettiest cemeteries in the state i cant help seeing those bodies in that cold dark hole
339973 he always used the phrases my friend and you take care or back at you he had all kinds of sayings
339974 certainly nothing is set in stone but obviously compensation has been a longtime issue for the governor
339975 the board is divided into geographic areas and i believe people from those geographic areas should be the ones who choose their representatives
339976 i think clearly thats the answer to a very faulted system
339977 they were very hopeful because they thought this project makes sense for the sorenson family
339978 we are actively engaged in pursuing several other potential sponsorship opportunities
339979 the city can only do so much weve given them every opportunity
339980 i was very unhappy on tuesday censorship was being applied it was clarified at the most senior level
339981 this came as a big surprise there was uncertainty from bocog
339982 in the end bocog will fall in line with the ioc it has been a fairly rough week we are back on track
339983 still around but posting a more on dvorak org lately
339984 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
339985 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
339986 on television screens inside the bus greyhound spokeswoman abby wambaugh said there were 37 passengers on the bus at the time
339987 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
339988 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
339989 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
339990 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
339991 one of the sweetest students ever enrolled in this program
339992 daniel kelly was well aware what deserting his daughter meant to her safety and welfare
339993 helpless child sitting unattended unkempt and unwashed in a small stroller in her own urine and feces
339994 this behavior indicates that andrea kelly did not merely allow danieal to die
339995 she may have even wanted her disabled daughter to die
339996 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
339997 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
339998 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
339999 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
