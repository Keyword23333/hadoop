8270027 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system
8270028 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8270029 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8270030 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication
8270031 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8270032 they are strongly engaged with political issues and social causes such as the environment poverty health and an australian republic
8270033 however they feel alienated and marginalised by old formal institutionalised politics
8270034 young australians are distrustful of politicians and they are not content to accept the hierarchies in traditional institutions of democracy
8270035 they prefer to engage in grassroots campaigns and cause based activities where they feel like they can make a difference
8270036 what weve seen from this literature review is that there are gaps in the research
8270037 there are no specific studies on what young people would like democracy to look like there is little if any research assessing the impact of young peoples political activities

8270048 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8270049 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8270050 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8270051 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8270052 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8270053 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8270054 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8270055 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8270056 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8270057 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8270058 we are hopeful that we may be able to assist colleagues in the kingsland police department georgia with the techniques we have developed recently we have already had some success at enhancing partial fingerprints on shell casings for other police forces where the cases were some years old and conventional fingerprinting techniques had been tried and failed
8270059 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8270060 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
8270061 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8270062 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8270063 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8270064 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8270065 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8270066 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8270067 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8270068 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8270069 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8270070 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8270071 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8270072 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful

8270184 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8270185 this trend is pretty astounding but what i make of it is that catholic school boards face parents who have a choice and as a result they may manage their resources better
8270186 stronger results at catholic boards suggest that competition improves school results since catholic parents can choose to send their children to either catholic or public schools
8270187 catholic board managers may be responding by improving the quality of education to attract students and funding
8270188 but it sort of makes sense that the level of service will be higher in a system where people have a choice
8270189 we went through an election where we decided we were not going to fund faith based independent schools without ever really having a serious debate about whether opening up active competition between schools would produce better learning outcomes
8270190 thats an absolute leap with no sound basis its a huge leap to say this means we should have faith based schools
8270191 it might be that parents who choose to send their children to a catholic school are more engaged in their childrens education by virtue of the fact they have made that selection
8270192 or it could be there is a more homogeneous ethos in the school a sense of shared community values and a sense of identity as a group a factor also believed to promote learning said fullan
8270193 but this sort of ethos can be created in public schools as well by promoting lots of deep moral values such as equity and fairness i would call these spiritual values even though theyre secular things like cooperation and cohesion
8270194 heads of the class a comparison of ontario school boards by student achievement
8270195 the toronto district school board does fabulous work and this business of one system being better than the other is really misleading

8270229 he was very much opposed to separation he saw the methodist societies as within the established church and anything that smacked of separation was something he took a very strong view of
8270230 at one point in the journal he is talking to the society at grimsby and goes into block capitals and says i told them i would remain with them as long as they remained with the church of england but should they ever turn their back on the church they turn their back on me
8270231 he john is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8270232 we would see a lot more development on our operations in the gambia and by extension the deepening of the countrys financial sub sector
8270233 it is also a tender movie about human beings and how people live together now we are more and more paranoid and aggressive the world is worse than ever this is like something in parentheses that says you dont have to earn a lot of money or own a lot of things to be happy that its all about how you care about others
8270234 of course it is interesting at first because you say ok no more problems it was difficult when i was young growing up with nothing but nothing is still something it was hard for me to earn a lot of money i was scared of it
8270235 every scene had to be done again and again until he was satisfied a scene might be very funny on paper but that meant it had to be at least as funny if not funnier on screen it involved lots of work and lots of false steps as well

8270237 she went and she looked after the filmmakers and got everyone together
8270238 thats way above what you might normally expect a chief executive to do
8270239 i think its inevitable that those kinds of comments are made in a time of such radical change for an organisation
8270240 she knows how to get on with people shes had a lot of experience dealing with bureaucracy and how to move forward within bureaucracy at the same time shes dealt with a lot of tough difficult personalities she knows the film world can be one of extreme relationships and extreme expectations
8270241 ive heard her shouting at an agent in los angeles for a very good reason
8270242 shes conciliatory but shes not afraid to stand up and say exactly what she thinks that was one of those situations where ruth was compromised and it was so underhand she got on the phone and gave them what for
8270243 ruth has a fairly good understanding of the australian industry
8270244 we look forward to working with her and the new board over the next five years
8270245 the thing i found most attractive with ruth was the combination of industry knowledge married with the fact that she wasnt coming out of the predecessor agencies and could come in with both knowledge and a fresh approach
8270246 not having any non commercial television here has meant that our industry is nowhere near as strong as the australian one
8270247 one of the things ive been told is that a goal for a film in australia is to achieve 100 000 admissions which is around 1 million in gross box office
8270248 thats our goal and weve got 4 million people and youve got 20 million
8270249 getting the organisation the right size and the right shape and the right morale and creating an organisational culture thats a big job and i think it will take a couple of years to get it right
8270250 you cant answer that question good ones and ones that reach audiences there isnt a recipe
8270251 when we set out to make films that look like hollywood films nobody wants them
8270252 hollywood doesnt want them the public dont want them because theyd rather have a hollywood one and the international independent market doesnt want them because they dont look like independent films theyre kind of nothing theyre in betweeners

8270258 in the last six or seven years all people have asked is when is the next mummy movie

8270265 many people are sick of hearing about it and this just seems to be cashing in on the story i do not think many people in the town will care if the programme comes back or not

8270267 you are having me on i dont think it is right that someones crime could be used as an excuse to bring back an old television programme

8270365 a campanha na televis o n o foi determinante para o movimento nas pesquisas a imensa maioria das pessoas que entrevistamos n o assistiram nem ao primeiro nem ao segundo programa
8270366 na avalia o de integrantes do dem os votos de alckmin nas ltimas semanas migraram majoritariamente para os indecisos
8270367 um grande contingente dos eleitores de alckmin optavam pelo tucano por serem fundamentalmente anti petistas como kassab tamb m disputa o anti petismo determinada parte dos eleitores decidiu aguardar para observar qual dos dois derrotar marta mais facilmente

8270397 although the number of new cancer drugs entering clinical development more than doubled between the early 1990s and mid 2000s only 8 percent of candidates with known fates won marketing approval in the united states

8270400 outside the agency academic and industry researchers who come up with creative ideas for evaluating drugs routinely complain that the fda is too conservative to embrace new methods
8270401 its nearly impossible to pinpoint the right patients for a drug without staging a large scale clinical trial that includes a lot of wrong patients
8270402 but inclusion of the wrong patients cause the trial to fall short of its goal and the drug isnt approved
8270403 we are learning more and more every day about how patients respond to a treatment
8270404 we can have new information retrospectively that would allow us to come up with a much better result but the fda wont let you use it

8270419 de beste manier om een einde te maken aan het kraken is de woningnood oplossen
8270420 als er genoeg woningen zijn heeft niemand meer een reden om te kraken wie het dan nog doet gewoon om ergens gratis of goedkoop te kunnen wonen kan dan hard worden aangepakt
8270421 kraken om een misstand aan te kaarten was en is een legitiem actiemiddel woningnood moet immers aan de kaak worden gesteld zeker wanneer gelijkertijd sprake is van leegstand er wordt echter ook gekraakt door mensen die voor zichzelf gratis woon of werkruimte willen hebben en die soms hun hand niet omdraaien voor geweld en overlast de sp is tegen deze vorm van voorkruipen en tegen asociaal gedrag we vinden het prima dat daar wat tegen ondernomen wordt
8270422 ze komen echter niet veel verder dan een meldings en overlegplicht en het recht van de gemeente om bij langdurige leegstand een andere gebruiker te mogen voordragen het is zeer aannemelijk dat dit weinig of geen effect heeft voor het effectief aanpakken van leegstand daarvoor zijn krachtiger middelen nodig bijvoorbeeld een leegstandsheffing of het niet langer fiscaal aftrekbaar maken van de kosten van leegstand
8270423 nee de kern van het probleem is de woningnood de overheid zou zich het lot van woningzoekenden en starters op de woningmarkt moeten aantrekken ze moeten zorgen dat er m r betaalbare woningen gebouwd worden minder gesloopt wordt waar dat niet nodig is

8270479 the central fact of this years election is that voters are fed up with republican rule the only way mr mccain can win the presidential race is if it becomes a contest of personalities rather than parties and if his campaign can instill in voters the perception that mr obama is a suspicious character while mr mccain is a fine upstanding gentleman
8270480 obama and biden will try to frame the presidential race as a normal democratic republican choice if they can do that they should win that would be far more difficult against a mccain lieberman ticket

8270556 los seis bancos m s importantes del sistema est n siendo m s selectivos en la asignaci n de cr ditos
8270557 son dos grupos y ste inicia el jueves el cupo es para diez personas pero si vienen m s nos adaptamos
8270558 lo primero que tratamos de ver es la combinaci n de colores que sepan combinarlos con la m nima cantidad de tubos de pintura para que no gasten ellos tanto y de que combinen el amarillo el azul el rojo el negro y el blanco de ah sacan todo lo dem s
8270559 despu s vemos algo de armonizaci n del color para que sus cuadros no les salgan sin armon a buscamos que sean est ticos a la vista y vemos un poco de los colores quebrador que vienen siendo los tonos m s apagados los m s agrisados o sucios es una mezcla especial de tonos que son muy bonitos pero que son dif ciles de conseguir y eso lo vamos viendo a medida que el alumno va trabajando no se les da una clase meramente te rica de pura explicaci n lo que hacen es ir pintando y en el momento en el que van saliendo los problemas las preguntas y las dudas las vamos solucionando
8270560 si alg n alumno quiere hacer algo en especial los dem s se nutren de eso vamos paso a paso y todos aprendemos de todos
8270561 por experiencia propia s que pintar es relajante es tambi n una forma de expresarte si traes alguna cosa adentro un sentimiento por ejemplo ahora tengo un grupo variado tengo gente muy positiva pero tambi n hay gente que viene con problemas que se sientan a pintar y se les olvida todo yo recomiendo el arte no nada m s pintura sino m sica escultura y todo lo dem s porque es como alimento para el esp ritu entonces me gustar a mucho que formen parte del grupo
8270562 me interesan mucho los j venes siempre estoy tratando de ver que los j venes hagan algo de arte porque cuando uno est sin hacer nada en casa de pronto te sientas agarras un lienzo en blanco y sacas algo y los j venes necesitan esto para enfocarlos positivamente
8270563 hay para hobbie y hay para quien le interesa profesionalizarse yo ya he tenido la satisfacci n de que varios de mis alumnos ya ganaron premiecitos en concursos como pinta tu m sica y otros los he visto ya hacer cosas bonitas
8270564 estoy muy contento muy feliz por este disco trabajaban mucho en los arreglos y todo lo grabamos en vivo
8270565 aunque soy un hombre que no tengo voz para big bang nos fuimos acomodando poco a poco a base de puro ensayo fue muy bonito es el trabajo m s bello que he tenido en los ltimos a os
8270566 la inspiraci n m s importante es estar a gusto siempre he sido un hombre feliz muy feliz tengo mis ratos pero adem s el tiempo me ha dado la raz n siempre he sido de buen trato no soy un tipo formal que hable serio inclusive hay que conocerme bien para saber cu ndo estoy bromeando
8270567 el programa contendr pera zarzuela y algunas cosas de comedia musical
8270568 incluso opereta y algunos temas caracter sticos de m xico quiero preparar muchas sorpresas para el p blico y armando manzanero me est ayudando en ese sentido
8270569 eso es impensable podr a hacerlo con tres tenores m s con cuatro o incluso con 10 pero aquel espect culo nunca m s extra o a luciano pavarotti
8270570 este sencillo va muy bien primero lo lanzamos en estados unidos y luego en m xico
8270571 para empezar lo llamamos derecho de antig edad por respeto y en honor a salvador liz rraga que tiene 54 a os de estar en la m sica y 44 de estar frente a la original banda el lim n en esta ocasi n incluimos melod as para todos los gustos grabamos corridos de historia no de los que se dedican a hacer un mal y por si fuera poco laura flores nos acompa en una de las melod as que se llama estamos enamorados
8270572 es muy bonito trabajar con esta banda y m s porque la mayor a somos familiares se vive d a a d a un ambiente muy padre salvador ya tiene casi tres a os que dej el clarinete por unos problemas de salud com nmente nos acompa a en entregas de premios o presentaciones especiales
8270573 hay un problema con una banda que nos est pirateando est n cantando rolas de nosotros ni siquiera han grabado un disco hacen presentaciones y dicen que salvador no pudo acudir por problemas de salud pero pues la gente se da cuenta muy tarde ya cuando pagaron su boleto que no somos nosotros esta situaci n est siendo muy desagradable para nosotros espero se arregle pronto

8270577 we are very proud of her we love her we shared her emotion this evening
8270578 i think we are united hillary supporters will graciously support her for her historic run and they will offer obama their support
8270579 i think she did what she needed to do to unite the party
8270580 i think some states will vote and then we will all change our views and support obama
8270581 i think its been a big part of the medias beat up in our delegation i havent seen anyone whos going to leave the party
8270582 i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8270583 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign into law a health plan that covers every single american
8270584 barack obama will end the war in iraq responsibly and bring our troops home a first step to repairing our alliances around the world
8270585 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8270586 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me who knocked on doors and made those phone calls who got in arguments from time to time to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8270587 what may frighten some americans about barack obama is his very excellence his fiercest critics have so far had little else to go on
8270588 but if he is truly that scary why is it so necessary to lie about him
8270589 if the real truth about him is so frightening why is it so necessary for someone like daniel pipes to ingeniously resuscitate the lie that obama is a muslim
8270590 if the actual facts are so damning why was it so necessary for fox and others to pump up the packet of hardbound fictions called obama nation a miserable book whose manipulative distribution propelled it to a debut at the top of the new york times best seller list
8270591 there will be those for whom race is the deciding issue but i believe their numbers are few for many more well meaning and tolerant people i believe the reason is fear it is fear of the unknown but not only fear of the unknown obama
8270592 i believe that the real fear is finding out what lies behind the big lies of george bush and more ominously by far dick cheney karl rove and a host of other neo con artists
8270593 this foreign visitor doesnt believe that this election is about race it is about the difficulty and the sacrifice involved in changing course acknowledging error actively working for a better common future
8270594 it is a battle over the kind of complacency and fear of change that put into the oval office its most underqualified occupant in living memory
8270595 were you in it for me or were you in it for them
8270596 this is all driven by steel partners theyre one of the most aggressive hedge funds in the world with 9 billion in assets under management
8270597 theyve been really public and this is no real surprise
8270598 theyre the largest shareholder they own about 10 percent at a cost of about 10 51
8270599 its a healthy return even when you spread it over four years

8270614 el shock positivo se alternar con uno negativo y se ve en los precios de los recursos naturales en los precios de productos b sicos que requieren de subsidios para que la gente pueda tenerlos como es el caso de los granos

8270616 gracias a lo que ha hecho el gobierno federal en materia de apoyos a la econom a familiar a trav s de subsidios y de pol ticas p blicas dirigidas a los que menos tienen

8270622 i thought hillarys speech tuesday was absolutely dynamic perhaps if she had spoke that way during the primary campaign she would have been speaking thursday as the partys nominee everyone was on their feet during her speech
8270623 she said all the right things tuesday she talked about what needed to be done and what she believes is basically the same as senator obama voting for barack obama will give us the same direction as if we were voting for hillary
8270624 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8270625 one of the rules we had in school was that when you made mistakes on your homework you had to correct them because if you didnt you would repeat them if john mccain doesnt know the economic policies he has been supporting for eight years have failed the heartland and failed this country hes destined to repeat those mistakes

8270633 those who could realistically be the catalysts for such legislation dont seem to have much interest
8270634 attempts to restore it are being opposed by most everybody
8270635 i am not 100 percent sure of the way we are going about this building maybe we shouldnt go with a design build team but maybe we should just bid the job
8270636 ive been researching new buildings on the internet if we commit ourselves to a price up front we are letting them know what our financial numbers are and they are going to go right to it
8270637 i am worried about taking on another multi million dollar project until we complete the recreation renovation project nothing is more important than upgrading our parks
8270638 i voted at that special meeting to proceed but i didnt want to i would like to see the financial bids come in from grae con on the recreation plan first
8270639 to decide if you want to pursue a new city building and if you do then you need to separate the building from the parks project if we dont do anything with a new building then we have to do something with the existing city annex building
8270640 you cant keep looking in the rear view mirror and expect to move forward
8270641 i think it takes the competitiveness out of the project i just wonder if we would have more options if we put the competitiveness back into the process i believe we would get several bids
8270642 that may be true but with the bid process we can only make a change in the building design if there is a change of condition the design build concept allows us to make changes throughout the design process
8270643 gone are the new york days of cheap artist studios for the ambitious but low on dough unless youre willing to trek to industry city where we found at least one space going for less than 2 a square foot there are still rent stabilized spaces left for mid career artists as well as market rate studios with a little more glitz ac units more windows but getting one takes either luck on craigslist or dogged persistence in the form of showing up and asking around since the landlord offers no contact information for the affordable studios yet and while a website is in the works the domain has yet to be registered well note it here once its live
8270644 the suspect told me he and wilkins ate a late dinner and then went to bed early the next morning he said they had a sexual encounter and then he went outside when he returned to the house turner frantz said they began arguing about her possibly being pregnant by another man
8270645 turner said he went outside to get a rope to commit suicide and when he returned to the house she wilkins had a knife and he tried to get her to stab him in the stomach when she refused he took the rope and strangled her
8270646 a homicide had taken place at 714 oakmont ave and the perpetrator may be at the jfk apartment building and i better get up there i advised the turn working at that point to check the house and i went to the jfk apartments where i found mr john turner the uncle of david turner frantz i also found a vehicle belonging to chandra wilkins in the building parking lot
8270647 i was in mr turners apartment when the call came over the radio that there was a body at the oakmont residence and it appeared to be a homicide i asked mr turner to accompany me to look for his nephew and almost immediately i heard on the radio that patrolman john lemal had arrested the suspect in the 400 block of north webster alley and was taking him to the police station
8270648 and when i started to approach him the suspect jammed his hands into his pants pockets
8270649 we arrived at the police station at almost the same time and i talked to david turner frantz for several minutes and then allowed him to speak to his uncle for about 15 minutes then i talked to him explained his miranda rights and told him there had been a homicide and he was a suspect
8270650 mr turner frantz said she was bleeding from her mouth and there was a pillow that was blood stained on one corner
8270651 he told me he attempted cpr on chandra after about 15 minutes and he said he didnt mean to kill chandra
8270652 he also said he had placed chandras body in a blanket near a dresser while he took their daughters to day care and a niece to work mr turner said he returned and placed the body in a closet so another niece wouldnt find the body
8270653 its a great thing but our fuel costs have quadrupled

8270659 the indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation

8270871 the syncretism of catholicism and maya religion notably the sophisticated custom of the tzutijiles centered on santiago atitlan is arguably not an equal mixture but rather maya religion with a catholic veneer

8271013 i know but with all im telling you maybe youll do better than us when you do get back out there and find atlantis
8271014 of course youll also need carson beckett if you decide to go he developed the artificial ata gene therapy which you both needed
8271015 ive already had the gene therapy becketts research was funded by one of my companies and i needed the gene so i could interact with the ancient technology
8271016 hmm must have forgotten and it only works on 48 percent of test subjects anyway
8271017 seems you must at least have the genetic receptors in your dna make up or the gene therapy fails beckett hasnt figured out a way to get around that yet
8271018 take beckett with you anyway you and he were good friends and radek zelenka
8271019 the czech scientist at the ancient outpost working with the russians
8271020 we barely had time to get the chair and remaining drones out of there and needed to leave at least enough technology behind to power oneills stasis chamber
8271021 actually the stasis chamber has an independent power source as a safety precaution probably drew in the initial power it required when the zpm was installed if id been there at the time i could have told them to take the whole stasis unit too
8271022 what are the chances the russians have left the stasis chamber intact
8271023 pretty good actually colonel chekov is in command he and oneill clashed often at the sgc before it all went public and to hell but they had a certain amount of respect for one another and oneill did save the planet
8271024 if you get the chance try to do something to help colonel mitchell hes a good man and deserves better treatment
8271025 i couldnt have done it without you rodney least not so quickly anyway
8271026 well that stands to reason i am after all a genius
8271027 well dr mckay how far had you and colonel carter got with the power problems on the device before she left
8271028 we havent the time to organize an expedition to another galaxy even if it was possible to open the stargate
8271029 and before you ask we cant spare either the daedalus or the prometheus either not while there are ori warships in this galaxy until you find a way to power up that device doctor those ships remain our sole line of defense
8271030 for what its worth you did the right thing sending her back but we may just lose the planet because of that
8271031 this isnt a punishment colonel president landry has asked for you explicitly effective immediately
8271032 you have one hour to make the necessary hand over arrangements
8271033 colonel sheppard im dr rodney mckay welcome to area 51
8271034 you heard the general colonel so if youll sit back and concentrate
8271035 like hell i will mckay im not doing anything until you tell me what this is and why im here
8271036 fine this is an ancient weapons chair and you have the strongest expression of the ata gene since since colonel oneill
8271037 as you can see colonel i really am tired so if you can say what you want to say really fast then ill just be on my way to bed
8271038 i was reading through the alternate carters notes and saw mention of them finding one of those zpms in egypt
8271039 and landry sent in a team to dig it up secretly of course and found nothing in our universe there was no oneill jackson carter and tealc to go back in time steal the zpm from apophis and stash it conveniently in a cave for us to find
8271040 but that just means the delorean of gateships is still here in area 51 and maybe we could
8271041 are you crazy one simple mistake and the whole time line would be altered and despite sams opinions to the contrary a lot of us have done very well in this timeline thank you very much
8271042 and that includes you or are you forgetting the black mark and the wraith lieutenant colonel
8271043 but they didnt witness thousands of their own people killed by their own military
8271044 lets plug into their universe in a few years time when they have to go public with the news that thousands of life sucking aliens are about to harvest the planet
8271045 im just saying the zpm in egypt is a possibility if push comes to shove
8271046 if push comes to shove colonel theres an ancient warship heading towards earth just passed the midway point between our two galaxies and they have zpms on board maybe we can convince landry to send the daedalus out there and offer them a lift back to earth in return for a zpm or two or the means of recharging our own
8271047 im as desperate as anyone on the planet to get the merlin device working again
8271048 its time to relax some aspects of martial law in particular i plan to lift the curfew on us citizens and allow greater freedom of travel within the united states military checkpoints will be withdrawn from areas where deemed no longer necessary
8271049 then figure something out doctor mckay because the ori will be back and wed better be ready
8271050 are a few more scientists dr grodin has come highly recommended from our british allies and of course you know dr beckett who has officially joined our medical personnel
8271051 ill leave you to get acquainted with your new staff doctor
8271052 lorne i think we have a situation here seal the mountain and blast doors from level 21 up to open on my authorization only
8271053 its locked ill try to open it from this side
8271054 colonel were under attack sir president landry is down i repeat the president is down
8271055 lorne i need you to hold sublevel 28 im bringing mckay
8271056 im a doctor not a bloody fireman let me go get a wheelchair
8271057 whats happening is it the trust whyd they lock us all into the infirmary
8271058 lorne i have the package and im on my way eta two minutes
8271059 levels 25 to 28 are secure all levels above 21 have been locked down as per your order if we can secure levels 21 through 24 as well then we can handle a siege situation
8271060 i guess none of us could have foreseen his own chief of staff assassinating him and hammond
8271061 dead along with four sgc personnel who must have been trust operatives
8271062 and theres no guarantee they all crawled out of the woodwork during the attack
8271063 we need to get some intel on whats happening out there
8271064 all frequencies are being jammed so theres nothing coming in and we cant get a signal out
8271065 thirty six military mainly support staff and sg teams on stand down since the ori came calling and i estimate around forty seven scientists between here and level 21
8271066 heres the plan i want us to get all the supplies we can carry from both the infirmary and kitchens and then i want any labs and offices stripped for laptops and whatever else those scientists think we might need then well fall back to this level
8271067 we should be able to hold levels 21 to 28 for several weeks
8271068 well be lucky if we have a few hours before they break through this has been planned carefully
8271069 colonel caldwell this is dr mckay we need help down here
8271070 dr mckay im aware of your situation but were a little busy up here right now the trust has sabotaged the ship weapons transporters and engines are offline prometheus is in worse shape in truth we could do with your expertise up here doctor
8271071 colonel caldwell this is colonel sheppard code sigma tau alpha six three seven
8271072 we dont know who else might be listening in and until we can guarantee a secure line then the less said the better
8271073 fireball that swept through the lower levels of stargate command is known to have collapsed several key levels military rescue teams have arrived at the scene and are moving slowly through the wreckage it has been confirmed that president landry was killed in the initial explosion along with elite members of his staff vice president robert kinsey has expressed his horror at this calamitous event
8271074 leaving going where theres no safe place left on earth
8271075 i need you to gather up every piece of equipment we can transport offworld
8271076 we cant go out there the ori have already taken over three quarters of the galaxy wed be sitting ducks
8271077 we dont exactly have a choice mckay if we stay here then the only person who might walk away from here alive is you and i doubt youd remain you for very long
8271078 we feed all the power from the national grid into the stargate dial atlantis and go all of us in one shot all i need is access to the power grid on level 25
8271079 we know from the other sam that our universes diverged three years ago when hayes declassified the stargate program and let the world know about the goauld and the ori therefore we know atlantis is still there at the bottom of an alien sea in the pegasus galaxy we know the earth gate is the only gate in this galaxy that can link to the city we have the address and we know well have to conserve power until i can get the city to rise to the surface or we bring back a zpm
8271080 i thought the city rose on its own once the shields
8271081 not in our timeline we didnt go to atlantis three years ago and we wont be taking elizabeth weir with us and frankly im not too keen on the drowning thing in this timeline in the hope that someone else will go back in time and persuade janus to save our asses in yet another timeline
8271082 sam told me how to raise the city you have to trust me
8271083 i figure we have less than two hours before the trust break through
8271084 novak i have a change in priorities i need the asgard transporter and the hyperdrive online as quickly as you can
8271085 about time lets lock this place up tight and get out of here
8271086 theyve breached level 21 falling back towards the gate room
8271087 lorne you have to hold them as long as possible and give our people time to get through the gate
8271088 you could say that lock onto my signal and transport on three
8271089 colonel we have transporters and estimate another ten minutes until we have the hyperdrive back online
8271090 sergeant stackhouse sir i have a message from colonel sheppard
8271091 were going to atlantis colonel sheppard wants you to head for pcz 439 and pick up any stragglers before joining us
8271092 put us in geosynchronous orbit over area 51 novak prepare to transport personnel and please use full scans to avoid bringing any parasites on board
8271093 sir all priority personnel have been transported secondary tier personnel are being targeted now
8271094 cooper once secondary targets have been transported head to the outpost in antarctica
8271095 lock onto colonel oneills stasis chamber and transport then open a channel to the ancient outpost
8271096 colonel chekov this is colonel steven caldwell of the daedalus i dont believe i need to explain whats happening a goauld fleet is heading towards earth and the ori wont be far behind you have twenty seconds to decide if youre staying on earth or coming with us
8271097 colonel caldwell this is colonel chekov yes we are aware of the situation we thank you for your offer of assistance and are ready to transport immediately
8271098 sir prometheus reports all personnel transported on board a courier has been transported across to the prometheus with the first of the rendezvous coordinates
8271099 tell prometheus well see them at the rendezvous point wait until they enter hyperspace and then follow
8271100 hyperspace windows are opening above the earth the goauld fleet has arrived sir
8271101 sealing off level 25 theyre right behind us but the seals are holding them up for several minutes each time
8271102 we lost henderson and garvey markham and two others are wounded im sending them down to join the back of the queue
8271103 keep moving the wounded down markham a few of the medics are at the back of the queue and can fix them up until theyre through the gate
8271104 colonel none of that equipment is essential and the stargate could shut down at any moment i suggest you forget the schoolboy heroics and get out of there now
8271105 power ratio dropping to minimal sustainable level in twelve minutes
8271106 generators are in place awaiting connection kavanagh says he can
8271107 no tell kavanagh to get everyone back to the gate room and get ready to punch in that gate address for the second city if this doesnt work
8271108 strip the wires two inches on red three on blue
8271109 no i just thought id bring the other four generators down here to keep the first one company yes of course all of them
8271110 well lets see how snippy you get when youve got less than six minutes to total shield collapse
8271111 and the water comes pouring in here and we all drown
8271112 im serious colonel this room will be underwater in less than three minutes and its going to take me that long to complete the connections
8271113 then youll need someone to make sure your tools dont float off
8271114 lets get him out of this damp area lift on three one two three
8271115 were on the surface sir he raised the whole damn city the scientists are assessing the damage now
8271116 people are going to be tired and hungry pretty soon i want you to take some of your men and scope out the closest rooms that can be used for temporary sleeping quarters get them cleaned up and prepped people are going to have to accept a little overcrowding until we can sort out something better
8271117 to set up a mess hall he should know what to do
8271118 not broken but the doc wants me to take it easy for a few days
8271119 for what its worth you made the right decision bringing us here
8271120 who can we use on the civilian side to get these people on their feet while mckay is out of it
8271121 grodins already got a few of the civilians checking through equipment making an inventory another nudge in the right direction and hell have the rest of them on their feet
8271122 okay ill leave it to you to give him that nudge
8271123 you really need to be removing those wet clothes before you catch your death of pneumonia
8271124 i just thought id check on our star patient first and give him back these
8271125 the extra passengers are stressing many of our systems to their limits
8271126 so most repairs are proceeding as expected slowly we need to offload most of those passengers as soon as possible and give the air time to recycle through the ship
8271127 better still we need to land and open up all the doors and windows
8271128 sending coordinates for the final jump well see if we can find you a good landing spot good luck daedalus out
8271129 a scan of the surface shows an area in the south of the continent that can support the weight of both ships the airs a little cleaner there too with far lower levels of sulfur and carbon dioxides
8271130 colonel chekov wishes to speak with you at your earliest convenience
8271131 colonel caldwell i am familiar with both ancient and asgard technologies i offer my assistance as we are all now in same boat
8271132 yes of course but blueprints of asgard hyperdrive and shields are same as korolev yes
8271133 i was an engineer in charge of readying her for that final battle
8271134 im grateful for the offer doctor but we have the situation under control on board the daedalus however the prometheus is in far worse shape and therell be at least a hundred people on board who are relying on that ship for a ride to safety
8271135 then i must go where i am needed so if you would please excuse me
8271136 even if the prometheus was fully operational we have too many refugees for the journey ahead some of them are going to have to stay behind and await a second trip
8271137 here on this desolate world with no natural food and water
8271138 daedalus can take three hundred drop them off at the first world we encounter with a stargate and then head back for the rest
8271139 then i will set up a refugee camp and coordinate supplies and rationing while the commander of the prometheus effects repairs to his ship with the help of dr zelenka
8271140 but if you do not return within twenty three days
8271141 then i do not know what we will do for there is no place left in this galaxy that is safe
8271142 major take us in as close to the prometheus as you can
8271143 colonel you have two hours before the daedalus heads out
8271144 you drowned rodney and the colonel cracked a couple of ribs bringing you back
8271145 you ready to see our city or are you just going to lie there all day
8271146 i i apparently i have you to thank for undrowning me
8271147 um did anyone check if the planet surface was um safe from radiation
8271148 no we thought wed just come out here and die a different horrible death after nearly drowning
8271149 kavanagh checked out the zpm chamber and he says the zpm is now fully depleted i guess that means were gonna have to find another one as soon as we can
8271150 well were not gonna steal a zpm from a bunch of kids and if colonel carter was right then atlantis hasnt got more than half a dozen drones left to protect itself whereas
8271151 a nearly depleted zpm if not fully depleted by now depending on whether theyve had to fight off the wraith during these past three years
8271152 well we have a little time to plan how were gonna wrestle that zpm and the drones away from the people in the tower
8271153 if sams recall was as good as she claimed then all wed have to do is sneak in and take what we want except
8271154 except she mentioned a certain amount of erh instability within the structure
8271155 look the other city has been exposed to the elements for ten thousand years so its hardly surprising that its falling to pieces
8271156 we probably shouldnt eat anything in case its been poisoned
8271157 right ill bear that in mind in case we get invited to dinner while were stealing their drones ships and zpm
8271158 then youll just have to see if youre as clever as that alternate universe mckay and find us the brotherhoods zpm
8271159 you need to rest and lorne has already scoped out some quarters you can use
8271160 major carter named it its a ship that goes through the gate
8271161 ease up a little dont hold the controls so tight youre gonna snap them off
8271162 atlantis takes control once you come in range of the city so no you dont have to worry about any fiery collisions
8271163 its a ship that goes through the gate hence gateship
8271164 that little thing isnt a ship its a shuttle a jumper im gonna claim this one and call it puddlejumper

8271174 manchmal kann ich es kaum glauben dass ich 20 jahre als fussballprofi aktiv war und dabei die ganze zeit bei gro en vereinen gespielt habe das ist ein ganzes leben
8271175 ich habe nie mit dem gedanken gespielt in einer anderen brasilianischen klubmannschaft zu spielen so etwas w re mir einfach nicht in den sinn gekommen ich habe nicht nur meine ganze jugend bei flamengo verbracht sondern danach auch praktisch meine gesamte profkarriere ich bin meinem heimatklub ewig daf r dankbar dass ich mit ihm die glorreichsten zeiten in der vereinsgeschichte erleben konnte
8271176 eine meiner bedingungen dabei war dass ich dort wieder im mittelfeld spielen konnte also auf meiner urspr nglichen position denn dort hatte ich meine fussballerische laufbahn ja begonnen ich bin kein geborener au enverteidiger sondern vielmehr ein mittelfeldspieler und als solcher habe ich meine karriere auch beendet mir war damals bewusst dass ich noch viele jahre im mittelfeld vor mir haben w rde das wollte ich entsprechend nutzen und zwar bereits mit dem gedanken im hinterkopf dass ich meine aktive laufbahn auf jeden fall bei flamengo rio de janeiro ausklingen lassen wollte
8271177 ich war der einzige der noch von der spielergeneration aus den 80er jahren brig geblieben war deshalb war es f r mich etwas ganz besonderes noch einmal den brasilianischen pokal 1990 zu gewinnen und sogar ein weiteres mal den brasilianischen meistertitel 1992 zu holen jene meisterkrone ist vielleicht meine wertvollste troph e berhaupt denn es war gewisserma en mein sch nstes abschiedsgeschenk
8271178 ich glaube dass mir da nur noch ein gegentor in erinnerung geblieben ist das war allerdings derart kurios und peinlich dass es viele andere geschichten in den hintergrund dr ngte es passierte im jahr 1991 in einem meisterschaftsspiel gegen sport recife um den brasileir o recife war akut vom abstieg in die zweite liga bedroht und ben tigte daher unbedingt einen sieg ich befand mich nahe der mittellinie und spielte den ball zur ck zu gilmar unserem torwart jedoch ohne mich dabei umzusehen da gilmar aber gerade weit vor seinem kasten an der strafraumgrenze stand kullerte die kugel langsam ins netz w hrend wir uns gegenseitig entsetzt ansahen am ende verloren wir das spiel mit 1 2 was f r eine blamage
8271179 dennoch wusste ich schon bald dass ich nicht als trainer t tig sein w rde das habe ich zwei mal versucht zun chst in der saison 1993 94 dann ein weiteres mal im jahr 1997 ich habe es nur meinem verein flamengo zuliebe getan denn man hatte mich darum gebeten und ich konnte wie ich nun mal bin nicht nein sagen
8271180 als ich in italien lebte habe ich bei einigen tv programmen mitgewirkt in brasilien habe ich mich dann nach der fifa wm 1998 endg ltig f r den medienberuf entschieden f r mich war es ein geradezu perfekter bergang von der karriere als spieler in die zeit danach denn ein fussballspiel zu analysieren hat mir schon immer gro en spa gemacht
8271181 und in den 20 jahren die ich als spieler aktiv war glaube ich einiges gelernt zu haben

8271313 im grateful for it its going to help me out later on in my career
8271314 i tried to tell him we really needed a fullback and we had a lot of defensive ends
8271315 he said i dont care i want to play defensive end in two weeks he was a starter at defensive end and hes been a starter for four straight years
8271316 he was asking to go over to the offense on goal line situations
8271317 he gets better every year hes gotten better bigger stronger faster
8271318 hes a tough opponent when the time comes hes definitely going to be able to perform hes going to cause a lot of havoc out there
8271319 hes just a laid back guy hes cool easy to get along with
8271320 i like to hang with him sometimes when i get a chance hes a good guy

8271323 one of michelle obamas signature efforts has been working to relieve crowding in the emergency room the second busiest in chicago
8271324 backed by a federal grant michelle obama in 2005 launched the south side health collaborative under which counselors advise patients with noncritical needs that they can receive care elsewhere at a reduced cost
8271325 a hospital report quotes michelle obama as saying the world is seeping in and our salvation will be the success of our partners
8271326 obamas program has enjoyed favorable news media coverage in chicago and was eventually expanded into a broader program the urban health initiative critics however describe the program as an attempt to ensure that the hospital retains only affluent patients with insurance
8271327 if you put enough money into it you could save a whole bunch of community health centers
8271328 edward novak president of chicagos sacred heart hospital declined to discuss the centers initiative in particular but dismissed as bull attempts to justify such programs as good for patients what theyre really saying is dont use our emergency room because it will cost us money and we dont want the public aid population novak said
8271329 we really didnt know what this office would be so it was really her creation
8271330 in december 2006 the medical center hired a public relations firm ask public strategies to help sell the urban health initiative
8271331 the firm delivered its report in may 2007 saying that while nurses were generally favorable about the urban health initiative primary care doctors were more negative viewing it as a break with ucmcs community commitment
8271332 while most of those surveyed expressed favorable views of the center and its program critics complained of arrogance and a lack of empathy
8271333 one survey question asked for reaction to a particular criticism that had been leveled
8271334 this new health initiative is not really about helping the residents of the south side of chicago
8271335 ive had some complaints from my constituents said alderman toni preckwinkle a former teacher who represents chicagos 4th ward and who will be an obama delegate at the democratic national convention
8271336 asked her personal conclusion preckwinkle paused they have decided they need to have as many paying patients as possible
8271337 ive heard complaints from a handful of constituents but ive also had calls from people in the health care profession complaining the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions whether its being implemented in the way thats in the best interest of the patient i cant tell you
8271338 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say you are going to do
8271339 mr obamas campaign began sending out a one page sheet of daily talking points to delegates instructing them what to say and what to avoid in talking to reporters
8271340 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8271341 these findings show that the conscious sense of our physical self and the physiological regulation of our physical self are linked
8271342 in fact our results suggest that the conscious sense of our physical self may actually contribute to its homeostatic regulation
8271343 it does seem like there are these connections broadly speaking between awareness and physiological changes
8271344 any time you can use illusion to tease apart whats happening in non illusory situations it could tell you about whats happening it may be that theyre starting us down the path of looking at these other issues if this can help that would be great

8271402 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8271403 we will see how this will develop we are sticking strictly to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there
8271404 now we have people flexing their muscles demonstrating force we can only regret that
8271405 this decision was taken at the highest level of the pentagon
8271406 he doesnt want to join either of them city or everton and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8271407 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8271408 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8271409 they want to sign him before next monday thats the plan
8271410 it would be a loan with an option for a transfer next summer
8271411 i think there are good chances this deal will happen
8271412 richard foster is doing a good job at right back and the defence looks fairly solid but i can understand jimmy being keen to bring in alan
8271413 it would allow richard to play elsewhere whereas alan is a natural right back who knows the game and his job
8271414 i think it would be better if the player shows a bit of commitment
8271415 i can understand him wanting to wait until the last minute to get the best deal he can but it would mean so much more to jimmy if he would come out and say he enjoyed it here last season and he wanted to come back and do his bit for aberdeen
8271416 if would be good to see that attitude because things might happen with other players who are showing commitment
8271417 things have dragged on and jimmy does not like that alan must know what he is doing so it is up to him but i would not push jimmy too far
8271418 at approximately 8 45pm last night police received a report from staff at a hospital in londonderry that one of the attending patients may be in possession of a gun
8271419 police arrived and one man was arrested in a amp e a bb gun was also recovered the man remains in custody at this time
8271420 one of our patients in the waiting room noticed another patient waiting for treatment was carrying a gun openly she was concerned about her safety and the safety of those around her and she alerted staff
8271421 staff put the patient into an isolation space and evacuated departments around him
8271422 staff felt there was a risk to everyone in the immediate area
8271423 something like this has not happened in my memory i have been at this department for 18 or 19 years and working in a amp e as a job for 25 30 years
8271424 we have got to have open doors staff deal with a lot of stress and strain during normal times but to add to this the possibility of an armed attacker coming in just makes this completely unacceptable
8271425 we are very excited about the opportunities this fund creates the economic political and social reforms coupled with several years of high growth that have taken place across many african economies make it a very attractive growth finance environment
8271426 he said if you try anything funny im not afraid to bust you
8271427 he took out the gun and said you can empty out your pockets
8271428 ill let my car be dirty its not worth it

8271431 it will be alleged that through exhaustive inquiries by detectives a possible person of interest was identified
8271432 meanwhile it s ok to blow things up and our films are so violent and our television is so violent
8271433 this is a difficult problem and there are no easy solutions i have proposed a program of mortgage replacement loans that i believe would stop the downward spiral of house prices the basic idea is to provide an incentive to stop defaults among those who now have positive equity but are vulnerable to a further price decline the federal government would offer every homeowner with a mortgage the opportunity to replace 20 per cent of that mortgage with a low interest government loan up to a loan limit of 80 000 that reflects the governments lower borrowing rate creditors would be required to accept this partial mortgage pay down and to reduce the monthly interest and principal by the same 20 per cent that mortgage replacement loan would not be collateralized by the house but would be a loan that the government could enforce by lodging a claim on an individual who does not pay
8271434 we dont have a long enough time series on the european union to estimate the parameters characterizing expansion and contraction but i wondered what would happen if you take the parameter values estimated on the basis of 60 years of u s real gdp growth rates and just apply them directly to the european data that procedure is not immune from criticism european growth rates are lower than the u s meaning that the algorithm may be a little too quick to call a recession with the european data since it is expecting to see stronger growth rates in an expansion on the other hand we know the values of these parameters pretty well for u s data and using prior information from another sample in this way can eliminate a lot of the statistical noise that would complicate an effort to start from scratch on the european data so i was interested to take a look it is interesting that the algorithm would have characterized europe as being in a recession in 2002 following the u s downturn in 2001 if you adopt my rule of making a call when the index exceeds 67
8271435 intra asia trade seems unable to offset slowing exports to the g 7 economies since most of it is actually for final exports to the g 7 and also as domestic demand in asian economies also slows demand for consumer and industrial imports and most importantly the slowdown extends from the u s to eu japan and ems like china latam so while a global recession poses risks to growth asian central banks largely behind the curve will continue to face inflation spiral loose monetary policy has resulted in negative real interest rates in india indonesia vietnam malaysia thailand singapore and philippines effect of food and fuel subsidy bill on fiscal balance would also reduce the room for expansionary fiscal policy to prop up demand moreover the recent easing of oil and commodity prices and possibility of their further downward trend amid a global slowdown especially u s and china might entice asia to believe that inflationary pressure may be abating impact of a global slowdown and commodity price correction on exports may in fact see asian countries returning to the export led growth strategy to follow a loose monetary policy and undervalued currency however this will only worsen the probability of a stagflation like environment in spite of large forex reserves the impact of these growing macro risks will worsen foreign investor sentiment posing risks to asset markets currency depreciation and financing of rising external deficits slowing surpluses
8271436 there are signs that the correction has already begun from 1 march 2007 to 1 march 2008 the value of the u s dollar declined by nearly 18 against the canadian dollar over 16 against the mexican peso by nearly 14 against the euro and by over 8 against the chinese yuan various trade weighted exchange rates reported by the imf show a u s dollar decline of 10 to 13 from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 during this same period u s merchandise exports grew 18 4 and merchandise imports grew 12 7 some of this growth is the consequence of the commodity boom but even removing soybeans corn and wheat from exports leaves growth in the remaining categories of u s exports at a hefty 16 8 moreover if imports of crude oil are taken out u s spending on imports grew by only 5 9 much larger changes than these are needed to bring the us current account into balance how much more of a dollar decline is needed depends on how adaptable the us economy is at moving resources into the production of goods that are exported or used to replace imports and on how successfully it expands the range of products it can produce and sell abroad
8271437 i dont have a church that im the pastor of so in my mind im a very untraditional reverend and my pulpit just happens to be mtv which is a very different type of congregation

8271439 theres nothing to see what is she not supposed to talk to guys theres nothing i can do but let guys be guys let girls be girls let jojo put his album out and let them live their life thats all i can do is raise them the best that i can and watch them operate in this world without cramping their style ive been blessed with kids that are smart and theyre not followers theyre leaders theyre not really caught up in the whole game like that they move around theyre basically good kids it doesnt guarantee anything but i did the best i could and i do the best i can

8271441 so as far as i can tell its quite possible gearbox will be doing halo 4 or whatever they end up calling it but its not a certainty yet
8271442 do you see the board of supervisors sitting here in the courtroom
8271443 only study bible that presents the text of the new king james version in chronological order
8271444 we understand more deeply what scholars and historians know of the earliest peoples
8271445 it bothers me when bad historical criticism trumps narrative structure
8271446 it s primarily a set of theological texts that have historical significance not a set of historical texts that have theological significance
8271447 removes the significance of the authorship through that process of transmission
8271448 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
8271449 looking through the eyes of someone who has had trouble understanding the bible this could be a refreshing alternative
8271450 the goal of the chronological study bible is not to replace the time honored canonical arrangement but instead to honor time as the setting in which the biblical record appeared readers who study this bible will return to their traditional in canonical order bibles better equipped to read them

8271466 we receive hundreds of requests every year from people who have lost holiday photos and are desperate to recover them
8271467 downloading and making a back up of digital photos is essential the longer photos are left on a memory card the higher the risk of them being lost damaged or the card being overwritten

8271498 good old gordon brown for saving us 2bn what a shrewd financial mind our prime minister must have
8271499 so at least dinosaurs like me who read the hard copy version get an opportunity to read it before the external world hears about it
8271500 why should i come to a meeting like this to discuss with the students sensitive topics that are appropriate to discuss but run the risk of that being reported maybe accurately or not accurately
8271501 student leaders especially those in paid positions are expected to generally be supportive of university policies
8271502 he told me all im looking for is a job
8271503 the problem is sahara is an arctic seal who is afraid of the cold its a bit like being a bird which is scared of heights nobody likes the cold but if youre a seal youve got to get used to it pretty fast
8271504 it took a little while but some memory from his puphood eventually seemed to surface and he came for a closer inspection once hed had a sniff and then slid over the top of it for the first time he found he actually likes it we dont think it will be long now before sahara is a proper ice loving arctic seal again

8271511 much of economics is about the relative efficiency of market allocation
8271512 to those who are damaged by otherwise useful developments in the economy from those who profit
8271513 its hard to know what to do about it other than to accept it and repair it rather than try to prevent it
8271514 opening up is a good thing for countries that have the administrative capacity to deal with it
8271515 every time someone gets a job in bangalore im cheering because it means global distribution has been more even
8271516 if theres not a mechanism for redistribution it probably wont happen
8271517 governments in wealthy countries like the u s are obligated to improve conditions of life for the poor
8271518 my message is make sure you know what youre doing when you wield this very heavy fiscal ax
8271519 i told them im just walking by im not the cops

8271542 joe biden whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again

8271551 americas greatness is bound up in the lives of the american people your hard work your devotion to duty your love for your children and your determination to keep going often in the face of enormous obstacles
8271552 i will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism she didnt have health insurance and discovered she had cancer but she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care for her and her children
8271553 i ran for president to renew the promise of america to rebuild the middle class and sustain the american dream to provide the opportunity to those who were willing to work hard and have that work rewarded to save for college a home and retirement to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month
8271554 to provide opportunity to those who were willing to work hard
8271555 to create a health care system that is universal high quality and affordable so that every single parent knows their children will be taken care of
8271556 to make america once again a nation of immigrants and of laws
8271557 to restore fiscal sanity to washington and make our government an instrument of the public good not of private plunder
8271558 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in the global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas we need a president who understands that we cant solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in the new technologies that will build a green economy
8271559 you know america is still around after 232 years because we have risen to every challenge and every new time changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good

8271563 ik vind het heel moeilijk om ze na een paar jaar los te laten hoewel we leerlingen iedere twee jaar een nieuwe leraar geven vind ik het heerlijk als ze vragen of ze bij mij mogen blijven mijn werkkamer is helemaal volgeplakt met leuke brieven e mails en tekeningen die ik van mijn leerlingen heb gekregen
8271564 ik zie niet alleen mijn huidige leerlingen maar hopelijk ook oudere leerlingen ik ben altijd benieuwd hoe mijn kinderen want zo zie ik ze terecht zijn gekomen

8271567 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
8271568 we plain ran out of time the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8271569 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
8271570 im definitely bummed about these api removals i was particularly looking forward to the p2p capabilities offered by gtalkservice but as always user security and privacy must come first

8271580 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8271581 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8271582 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season
8271583 gareth wants to concentrate on playing to the best of his ability for aston villa and we hope this draws a line under the matter

8271588 it is plain to see the devastating effect the government is having on the housing market as it keeps tight lipped about the possibility of a stamp duty holiday
8271589 the chancellor must either press ahead with the legislation immediately or confirm that there will be no stamp duty holiday so the people who are buying property move ahead with their purchase

8271615 a total of 50 people have been caught fishing illegally in shropshire and worcestershire
8271616 a team from the environment agency checked 582 anglers to see if they had proper licences during an operation at sites in the two counties t he agency said some people fishing illegally tried to run away and others were caught trying to buy a licence over the phone as the water bailiffs approached

8271640 there is much talk about a change in world wide consciousness ushering in a new dimension but it must be understood that this new dimension is not some mumbo jumbo mystical plane that will descend from the skies it only implies a critical mass of humans thinking the 2012 way and thus ushering in an enhanced dimension to live in in layman terms each of us makes the world a better place
8271641 what is the highest thing i can do for you how can i best support you in your mission your endeavors

8271652 children can get caught up in the excitement of the back to school season frenzy and forget to watch out for cars
8271653 some children have trouble making accurate judgments about traffic speed and distance so drivers need to be particularly alert and aware when driving in school zones and neighborhoods
8271654 they often dont realize it but parents create traffic safety hazards in school zones
8271655 schools designate specific drop off arid pick up zones to optimize safety and minimize risks but by disobeying these zones they create a dangerous situation for children including their own
8271656 drivers should always be alert and observant to their surroundings but even more so around children
8271657 fourteen years later i went up again to jerusalem this time with barnabas i took titus along also i went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that i preach among the gentiles but i did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders for fear that i was running or had run my race in vain yet not even titus who was with me was compelled to be circumcised even though he was a greek this matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus and to make us slaves we did not give in to them for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you as for those who seemed to be important whatever they were makes no difference to me god does not judge by external appearance those men added nothing to my message on the contrary they saw that i had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the gentiles just as peter had been to the jews for god who was at work in the ministry of peter as an apostle to the jews was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the gentiles james peter and john those reputed to be pillars gave me and barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me they agreed that we should go to the gentiles and they to the jews all they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor the very thing i was eager to do
8271658 you would think it would be hard to read the bible and not come away at least a bit of a socialist
8271659 foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head
8271660 the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
8271661 when you give a luncheon or dinner do not invite your friends your brothers or relatives or your rich neighbors if you do they may invite you back and so you will be repaid but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind and you will be blessed although they cannot repay you you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous
8271662 how can we celebrate anything when there is so much poverty around us
8271663 have your parties but make sure you include the poor in the festivities
8271664 the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man
8271665 in selecting sen joseph biden as his running mate barack obama gains some needed foreign policy expertise but loses some credibility if washington is as bad as these two say it is was biden a contributor or an enabler during his six senate terms if 36 years in the senate doesnt make you an insider and part of the problem what does
8271666 when obama the most liberal member of the u s senate according to the 2007 vote scoring done by national journal picks the third most liberal senator does that count as reaching across the aisle
8271667 joe biden wasnt even on barack obamas short list until august 7 when russia suddenly invaded the neighboring country of georgia thats the word from key democrats meeting here in denver who say the obama campaigns need to shore up its foreign policy bona fides helped push the delaware senator to the top of the pack we didnt pick our nominee vladimir putin did is how one democrat who professes to be pleased with the biden choice put it
8271668 just what changes the old democratic order when you have bill clinton speaking one night and hillary clinton the next night
8271669 the hard core left vowed to turn out 50 000 protesters for the democratic national convention this week they pledged to re create 68 and cause the kind of tear gas infused revolutionary havoc that marked the dnc in chicago four decades ago police prepared for the worst riots media from around the world anticipated the best pictures but when rhetorical push came to real life shove the nostalgic marx adoring organizers of re create 68 seem to have mustered no more than oh 68 bodies
8271670 w hat does one call a lawmaker who would condemn to death the child survivor of a botched abortion by permitting doctors to refuse that child once born alive potentially life saving medical treatment and nutrition a number of things come to mind mr president isnt one of them
8271671 you know why they call it birth control because its meant to stop a birth from happening nine months later we know when life begins everyone who ever bought a pack of condom knows when life begins to put it another way with conception something begins what do you think it is a car a 1948 buick
8271672 the most enthusiastic members of the denver party believe that the country is finally for the first time really on their side the nations and the partys left is both enlarged and inflamed the shrewder ones who are calling the shots hope that the public will be sufficiently disaffected with the republicans to tolerate or overlook their ideology thus the task before obama and biden this week is threefold they must feign toughness on foreign policy and moderation on values at the same time they must present their enthusiasm for bureaucracy as sympathy for the economic challenges of the middle class they must persuade the country that they are not what they are the most left wing ticket their party has run in 36 years you cant fool all of the people all of the time 51 percent may be more feasible
8271673 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
8271674 if you see a man approaching you with the obvious intent of doing you good you should run for your life
8271675 if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
8271676 a sure sign of a genius is that all of the dunces are in a confederacy against him
8271677 i would like to take you seriously but to do so would affront your intelligence
8271678 if it happens that obama is elected or even his just being nominated will send positive ripple effects throughout the country on the race issue
8271679 t he reasons they think biden would be strong is because one hes a great attack dog and they think the press loves biden and so the press will sort of go easy on him on the past gaffes and when hes contradicted obama
8271680 i think that the democratic party over the last eight to a number of years has wanted a prize fighter and they have two right now
8271681 my colleagues in the national media are absolutely biased in the tank supporting the obama candidacy while claiming the mantle of objectivity
8271682 as intense as the anticipation over obamas choice is it pales next to the hubbub over whether mccain is going to tap lieberman who was al gores running mate in 2000 this would give lieberman a unique niche in american history one politician who was the vice presidential nominee for both parties we would speak of it with awe like that story about the two headed turtle in brooklyn
8271683 ronald reagan had some success with this question a few years ago and things werent nearly as crummy then as they are now are you better off now than you were four years ago but this time its been eight years
8271684 a lot of people have never seen anything that looks like a michelle obama before shes educated shes beautiful shes tall she tells you what she thinks and they hope that she can tell a story about barack obama and about herself

8271767 ive had people voice their opposition to me that im ruining the herd immunity that my child would put their child at risk
8271768 someone pointed out to her that it was her choice to do that but that she was putting everyones kids in jeopardy by not having her kids vaccinated
8271769 i have no problem welcoming unvaccinated children into a play group and i have no problem with them attending school
8271770 simply put my children are vaccinated the risk is minimal i may not agree with other parents choices but theres no reason to hold that against the child

8271783 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8271784 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8271785 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy

8271824 we see many latin american companies like cofaz experiencing an important growth stage in their business cycle due in large part to the red hot manufacturing sector here in brazil

8271913 under age drinking and alcohol misuse is a very visible problem throughout belfast
8271914 we only have to look at our street corners almost every night of the week to see that it is a problem that is growing rapidly with a significant number of children as young as 12 now drinking on a regular basis
8271915 there is a strong correlation between alcohol abuse and anti social behaviour so tackling this problem is a high priority for both the police and belfast city councils community safety team through the work of the get home safe project
8271916 every friday night up to eight council community safety officers are deployed with police officers and community workers in specific areas neighbourhoods in east south west and north belfast where they carry out a number of important duties
8271917 these include visiting off licences to brief them on supplying alcohol to young people confiscating alcohol from under eighteens and issuing warning letters to parents and ensuring public places such as parks waste ground etc are not being used as a place to drink
8271918 during this summers marching season this work was extended to confiscating drink at parades and assisting the psni in the high profile and successful snapper operation which saw over 1 000 items of alcohol confiscated from under age youths throughout belfast
8271919 this work will continue on friday nights throughout the year and we hope to increase the provision to saturday nights
8271920 underage drinking often leads to criminal damage assault and fear of crime for residents in areas subject to this kind of anti social behaviour it presents a significant issue to our local community
8271921 we want to send a message to those juveniles who drink in public areas and exhibit anti social behaviour that this will not be tolerated
8271922 we invited the get home safe representatives along to a meeting of the inner east forum which meets in our premises and which im a member of
8271923 its a work in progress but the involvement of the get home safe group definitely helped
8271924 it has raised the awareness of young people and others of their responsibilities it has been welcomed both by young people and by the people living in the areas
8271925 people can see the benefits of being responsible and drinking in sensible places
8271926 there has been a reduction of alcohol related violence so it has been very positive
8271927 we have been dealing with anti social behaviour in the finaghy for some time now particularly in and around woodlands playing fields and wedderburn park
8271928 working with the get home safe project has helped us address this issue and give some sort of piece of mind to local residents
8271929 we the finaghy crossroads group havent the power to confiscate alcohol so we advise the teams when they come into the area on a friday night of where underage drinking is taking place and where they should target their operation
8271930 the community in west belfast have shown their determination to tackle difficult issues such as on street drinking and the anti social behaviour that it leads to
8271931 we want to encourage respect and build safe communities we welcome partnership initiatives such as the get home safe joint enforcement operations where the community has been able to work closely with belfast city council and the psni to make a real impact on the ground

8271961 a veces me cuesta creer que pas 20 a os jugando al f tbol como profesional en equipos de un gran nivel es toda una vida
8271962 nunca se me ocurri jugar en otro equipo brasile o es algo que no podr a plantearme pas toda mi juventud en el flamengo y luego pr cticamente toda mi carrera profesional soy eternamente grato por haber participado de la etapa m s gloriosa de la historia del club
8271963 una de las condiciones que impuse fue la de que volviera a jugar como volante que era mi posici n original cuando empec en el f tbol no soy un lateral sino un volante que termin jugando ah yo sab a que tendr a m s a os de f tbol jugando en el mediocampo quer a disfrutar de eso y ya ten a clara la idea de volver al flamengo para cerrar mi carrera
8271964 yo era el nico sobreviviente de la generaci n de los a os 80 y para m fue muy especial contribuir para la copa de brasil 1990 y sobre todo el brasileir o 1992 aqu l fue probablemente mi trofeo m s especial porque supo a una dulce despedida
8271965 creo que s lo me acuerdo de un gol en contra pero fue tan rid culo que cont por muchos fue un partido del brasileir o del 1991 ante el sport de recife ellos estaban a punto de bajar a segunda divisi n y necesitaban ganar casi desde el mediocampo yo retras la pelota a nuestro arquero gilmar pero no mir antes l estaba al otro lado del rea grande la pelota entr despacito y nosotros nos quedamos mirando uno al otro perdimos 2 1 qu verguenza
8271966 pero sab a que no ser a entrenador llegu a aventurarme dos veces en esa funci n en 93 94 y luego 97 aunque lo hice por amor al flamengo porque me lo pidieron y yo nuca supe decir no
8271967 cuando viv a en italia hice algunas participaciones en programas de televisi n y en brasil asum definitivamente la profesi n a partir de la copa mundial de 1998 para m es una secuencia perfecta para la carrera de jugador porque siempre me encant el an lisis del juego
8271968 y en esos 20 a os dentro de la cancha creo haber aprendido algo

8271980 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8271981 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8271982 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8271983 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8271984 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8271985 i think theres this myth out there that people dont care about insurance that they arent going to buy it that people who arent insured are just deadbeats
8271986 a huge number are buying it individually despite the huge sacrifice it means for them financially
8271987 i think people know that if you get sick you could lose your health you could lose your car you could lose your house you could lose everything
8271988 while it is encouraging to see that the number of uninsured people is falling here in connecticut there is even better news on the horizon
8271989 everyone needs health coverage and now in connecticut our uninsured adults can get it through the charter oak
8271990 what people dont understand is that women are working the majority of the minimum wage and part time jobs
8271991 those are the job areas that rarely pay health insurance and yet women are continually giving up of themselves to make sure others are covered
8271992 the reality is that minimum wage at the end of the day is what many connecticut women are having to live on its their only income not an alternative income
8271993 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8271994 cvp is also engaged with the entire state of on their statewide recycling education campaign we look forward to seeing success in conyers and believe that conyers can help lead the state in improving the amount of recyclables collected
8271995 the recycling program will be as easy as possible for residents allowing them to put all of their recyclables together in one large cart and weve replaced one of our twice weekly garbage collections with recycling to drive home the message to residents that much of your trash can be and should be recycled
8271996 it is always challenging to introduce a new and unfamiliar program into a community thats why we have chosen to partner with the curbside value partnership to develop a strategy for communicating with residents

8272050 the car was in perezs name but he did not have insurance
8272051 that is to beat belle glade glades central in the muck bowl and to win the state championship
8272052 those are our priorities being undefeated thats something we like and we cherish but thats just a feather in the cap it can be a distraction but each week we dont harp and we dont preach the undefeated aspect of the season we win one game at a time and when it comes to the muck bowl thats it
8272053 when i played back in the late 1980s it was pretty much whoever was at home ended up winning
8272054 that was pretty consistent in the mid to late 90s glades central won seven in a row that was really tough
8272055 you have a winning season if you win that game even if youre 1 9 im kidding but not we beat them one year and went on and lost the state championship and as much as that pill was hard to swallow it was all right because we had beaten glades central
8272056 i know there are fathers and sons who have won it at different schools but we were the first father son duo to win a state championship at the same school
8272057 it was really cool my dad is very involved and still part of this program hes there every day it means a lot to have him around hes my mentor
8272058 we only put 11 on the field at one time but we believe our 11 are better than anybody elses 11
8272059 if we can condition them to the point where we can go both ways we feel we have the advantage we feel we have the better athletes
8272060 the kid that has to go both ways is better prepared and is a better football player than the kid who can just concentrate on one thing of course i would love to have an offensive line that just plays offensive line but we just cant do it that way our best players are going to be on the field

8272069 dads the only one in his building who gets the herald
8272070 and thats the only paper this guy steals the globes are never touched so he started ordering the globe for a while but hated it then he ordered both papers they came in the same plastic wrapper because they were delivered by the same person but it was torn open and only the herald was taken
8272071 he must think the way i do because he never touches the globe so ill give him credit for that funny i delivered globes when i was a kid 70 years ago but ive been a herald reader most of my life i love opening my paper every morning i just dont see how anyone can live off tv news

8272105 in het kader van haar onderzoek en haar werk inzake handhaving van de naleving van mededingingswetgeving in de it industrie betreffende onder andere microsoft heeft de commissie adviesdiensten van deskundigen nodig om technische feiten vast te stellen
8272106 bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot de status van technische documentatie met informatie over de interoperabiliteit voor communicatieprotocoltechnologie zoals vastgesteld door de beschikking van de commissie betreffende een procedure tegen microsoft
8272107 de toezichthouder adviseert de commissie over microsofts naleving van de beslissing van 2004 vooral wat group server protocols betreft
8272108 de technische bijstand van deze aanbesteding zal een veel breder terrein dekken dat veel verder gaat dan enkel group server protocols maar het zal wel deels complementair zijn aan het werk van de toezichthouder

8272121 sen obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way
8272122 republican legislators respected sen obama his negotiation skills and an ability to understand both sides would serve the country well

8272130 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8272131 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8272132 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8272133 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8272134 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8272135 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8272136 it was one of those things where i started looking at food and thinking ok this is killing me and im worth more than the 10 minute satisfaction of eating this food
8272137 more than anything i hope my experience inspires one more person to start eating better and taking care of themselves or get out on a bicycle to find a passion in exercise
8272138 our job is really to help highlight the work thats being done to improve employees health and then make health ambassadors out of your neighbor your colleague at work to help spread their stories
8272139 this is really about starting where you are and moving toward a state of health and fitness
8272140 we dont expect you to change your life dramatically overnight but what happens is as you integrate small changes into your daily routine it then becomes what you know
8272141 ever since the r8 was unveiled weve been inundated with enquiries about a race version with the audi r8 we will offer customers a racing sportscar equipped with high calibre technology and the typical audi qualities but which is nevertheless easy to handle
8272142 theres no other place that would help me out and do this for me
8272143 they were able to furnish the dental lab for us the community foundation made that happen
8272144 the nicest part of this job is none of it is for us
8272145 at one point i was a highly paid gopher because thats what it took
8272146 we hit the ground running and running very fast we were busy
8272147 im extremely grateful for the foundation and im extremely grateful that they are looking at the whole valley
8272148 theyre so open to funding an agency like ours that serves the immigrant population
8272149 the money has really helped us to educate people about topics we think are important in their lives but which they have no information about
8272150 the reality is this isnt the first time and it wont be the last time the stock market hiccups
8272151 i want the citizens of yakima to feel this is an asset that can be utilized to benefit the whole community and not necessarily just a small part of it i think this foundation has really come to fruition
8272152 i feel this is the most important thing ill ever do
8272153 this is a calling for me i cant think of anything else id rather be doing
8272154 by default people dont think of taking care of their wills their estates the way they should they should think of the yakima valley
8272155 the number of uninsured fell and a lot of the fall is due to the increase in coverage in public health insurance
8272156 speech at the democratic national convention probably could have been better titled
8272157 this is a classic glass half full glass half empty situation
8272158 we need to remember that poverty can do terrible things to kids
8272159 all the other risk factors that make children vulnerable are exacerbated by poverty
8272160 were now at the point in the recovery where were seeing some progress in reducing those numbers in poverty
8272161 but oklahoma continues to exceed the national average in poverty by quite a bit
8272162 the concern would be that if these numbers are as good as it gets in oklahoma that would not be that great
8272163 while we do see the rising tide lifting the boats there are some who have not made it onto the boat and are floundering in the water
8272164 were in the bottom rankings of everything having to do with healthcare
8272165 we just simply cannot tolerate being at the bottom of every statistic that has to do with health care health insurance and our health delivery system in this state its untenable
8272166 its rather arrogant to believe that humans can affect our climate
8272167 could it not be that the data today is better and more refined than the data you had in high school and therefore global cooling was actually a wrong interpretation
8272168 i think its inappropriate to say that theres not different opinions on this
8272169 for people to say that the debate is done on this issue i think thats mistaken
8272170 we know that we release pollution into the air thats what weve done with our smokestacks with our cars we now are having an effect on the environment and we have to decrease that effect
8272171 the opinions on which the war in iraq the invasion began
8272172 i support at the time the decision was made there was universal agreement not just in our country but in many other countries that there were threats imminent threats threats of weapons of mass destruction that was the best intelligence that we had at the time
8272173 i support a withdrawal that has a tremendous input from commanders on the ground
8272174 i would not support a quick withdrawal unless that is the opinion of the commanders on the ground
8272175 i think the war is over halliburton nyse hal won
8272176 the middle east peace process is the main factor that could produce the desired effect
8272177 as palestinians lose hope in the peace process and look despairingly at both the fatah and hamas leaderships there is a danger of extremist al qaeda style alternatives emerging

8272190 to expect any player to play like that in that game first game ever id be lying if i told you he could play like that
8272191 but that kind of defines him hes got all the stuff all the other things that go with being this great athlete who can catch hes got the brains hes mature as a competitor and he can utilize all his skills
8272192 you go into the illinois game its like a playoff game a playoff atmosphere a bowl game atmosphere
8272193 you look at the first half he was wide eyed you walk into your first game everyone is
8272194 i think it was the teams coming out party more importantly
8272195 data services apply the same philosophy of reuse and flexibility that soa offers but to the data tier
8272196 provide a level of abstraction that frees developers from concerning themselves with the physical location or format of the underlying data
8272197 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
8272198 i hope people who deliver humanitarian aid would be choosy about how they deliver it
8272199 we are not aware of any plans for ships to go to poti today
8272200 support peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
8272201 our tasks include the control of abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of arms shipments
8272202 maybe because he looks younger than his actual age barack obama gives young people hope that they can achieve the political representation that they dont have right now
8272203 you often hear that women racial minorities or homosexuals are under represented in us politics but by far its mainly young people who suffer from it
8272204 because when you live 30 miles from the next police station you have to be able to defend yourself
8272205 since i was a little kid i wanted to be in a convention being in this place is very surreal
8272206 we have to pull from iraq to take care of problems at home
8272207 im jewish and im of course a strong supporter of israel but i dont believe that the war in iraq has made us and israel more secure
8272208 my vote wont go to him obama i was elected to support hillary
8272209 is a great organizing tool we can schedule an event and thats how i got to meet hundreds of people sharing the same political interests

8272244 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when joe biden was tapped as obamas running mate its a great view

8272247 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8272248 hillary clinton just gave the most amazing speech it was perfect in every sense
8272249 i have catch phrases now that i will be using to bash any mccain supporter that comes near me in a 10 mile radius
8272250 she proved why she is in a league of her own
8272251 hopefully now the democratic party will move forward unified as one
8272252 mrs clinton gave one of the most brilliant speeches tonight
8272253 although i enjoyed the speech i really thought that hillary should have been a little stronger in her words in support of barack obama
8272254 it was very clear right from the beginning within the first minute of her speech she said im for barack obama
8272255 she said it over and over and over again throughout the speech
8272256 dont believe it when they talk of bitterness there werent any bitter hillary supporters among us
8272257 we all said of course we were going to support our partys candidate sen obama
8272258 its going to be difficult to cast a vote for somebody who i thought made a wrong choice
8272259 if i do vote for obama it will definitely be because sen clinton asked us to do it but its not going to be a joyous vote
8272260 hillary clinton gave her speech and ive got to say it was fantastic she did an amazing job
8272261 she did a very good job of talking to her supporters and winning them over for barack obama
8272262 but i also think that she won a few barack obama supporters as well

8272268 there is really no perfect solution at all on how were going to handle this this is something we didnt ask for the uil just told us hey youre going to amarillo now so we have to go
8272269 it will be a significant increase on our travel budget
8272270 and its all related to the uil realignment everything is going to cost more money so we have to look at every trip closely were being as wise and frugal as we can be with our expenditures
8272271 ours is not in the millions yet but its close
8272272 lake view makes a lot of long trips as well so that makes it doubly difficult for us its doubled what we accounted for but so far we havent had to make any cuts
8272273 were a member of the uil we support the uil and under the present policy of no fewer than six teams per district in class 5a there was no other choice
8272274 the other option was to move us into el paso or the dallas fort worth area and we probably would have been in worse shape
8272275 everybody wants to blame the uil but they hold the deck and they dealt the cards
8272276 this is an awesome and competitive league and were excited to be a part of it i dont know what the uil could have done differently it is what it is well show up and try to win no matter who and where were playing

8272282 alhoewel de leden algemeen anticiperen dat de volgende beleidsstap waarschijnlijk een verstrakking zal zijn is het tijdstip en de omvang van elke beleidswijziging afhankelijk van de evoluerende economische en financi le ontwikkelingen en de gevolgen ervan voor de verwachte economische groei en inflatie
8272283 het monetaire beleid op dit ogenblik bevindt zich ruwweg op het niveau waar het hoort ik denk dat de discussie over het verlagen van de rente in europa voorbarig is

8272533 and if this is the toughest thing i have to face in life i think ill have a very easy life theres bound to be more peaks and valleys along the way and but i think this has helped prepare me for those peaks and valleys that ill face further in life
8272534 my goal in all this was never to get the approval of everybody

8272550 the indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation
8272551 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore and because we have made this investment we will not move they are wrong
8272552 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think its going to be a great cost to west bengal
8272553 i would love to see tubby smith rick pitino tom izzo roy williams or billy donovan
8272554 did you see what team usa did when they won the gold they circled up and jumped up and down i didnt see the celtics do that when they won the title but you see college teams do that its just a different emotion in college and on the national team you play for a short time together and keep the energy level high in the nba you play 100 games and wear people down its a different meter
8272555 expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results

8272557 we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin

8272577 the 2004 olympics in athens showed how to get it embarrassingly and disgracefully wrong over the past 16 days beijing has shown the world how to get it magnificently right
8272578 sixteen days of glory but at what price the olympics are now almost a dirty word in athens most regularly used by politicians who use the issue of decay as a powerful campaigning point

8272584 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8272585 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest

8272587 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
8272588 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
8272589 tv viewers and their families shared fun and excitement so that their home atmosphere became better and they temporarily forgot about worries in their work

8272677 i will not go into an argument to prove that congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity every member upon this floor knows it we have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity but as members of congress we have no right so to appropriate a dollar of the public money

8272855 in our world of terrific technologies we happily embrace the new alternatives but there is something glaringly wrong in that circle of embrace for the one hand typist
8272856 if one hand has good usage then although harder on the hands the standard one hand qwerty is perhaps the best choice

8272869 maybe the governor will listen but were basically saying that we need to consider all of our options

8272871 its a trojan horse to allow the big oil industry to exploit peoples concerns about these huge gas prices were experiencing so they can have a crack at more leases
8272872 new facts and considerations have caused the county board of supervisors to review this policy
8272873 studies have been conducted on the offshore natural seeps that conclude that oil extraction actually mitigates the natural seepage

8272902 its a very rigorous program and its certainly taking more of our time as well its like someone giving you a surprise exam at school every now and again it is certainly a rigorous program that is being enforced by the cfia
8272903 were getting the feedback that theyre just totally overloaded weve had some inspectors say they want to know should i be dropping the inspection work or should i be dropping the paper work theres no clear direction by cfia on this because i dont think they anticipated the increased work load or at least if they did they didnt have any plans to deal with it
8272904 has some advantages as it is a structured program and spells out clearly what needs to be done however we do not have enough staff to run at full capacity

8272907 shale is the most significant domestic natural gas find in 50 years
8272908 which means the united states will become gas independent and more industrially competitive versus europe for gas intensive industries such as chemicals fertilizer smelting iron and aluminum

8272979 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8272980 it tears at our souls and so it is for me the bitterest of ironies that abortion on demand found refuge found a home and it pains me to say this found a home in the national democratic party my party the party of the weak the party of the powerless
8272981 you see to me protecting the unborn child follows naturally from everything i know about my party and about my country nothing could be more foreign to the american experience than legalized abortion it is inconsistent with our national character with our national purpose with all that weve done and with everything we hope to be
8272982 offers a new tough foreign policy that is neither republican nor democratic but is a strong smart american foreign policy

8273039 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice

8273041 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion

8273057 i strongly believe in the mission vision and patient care culture of hannibal regional hospital and hannibal regional medical group
8273058 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
8273059 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year
8273060 this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place this would be an anti abortion statute
8273061 obama has also voted present again effectively a no vote on requiring parental notification not parental consent when minor children obtain abortions
8273062 i could find no instance in his entire career in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
8273063 barack obama is the most pro abortion presidential candidate ever

8273076 when pressed about whether the regulation would protect health care workers who consider birth control pills plan b and other forms of contraception to be equivalent to abortion hhs secretary michael leavitt said this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area

8273081 tv viewers and their families shared fun and excitement so that their home atmosphere became better and they temporarily forgot about worries in their work

8273084 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimising the hazards of behaviour
8273085 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8273086 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programmes which are important for saving lives
8273087 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8273088 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8273089 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8273090 developing countries are now face to face with problems that affluent countries confronted decades ago but with the shift in the cancer burden a nations resource level can no longer be viewed as a barrier to cancer control

8273093 what some people dont realise about classic rock is that its still being made
8273094 this years best new bands are some of the strongest in years while the albums of the year list sees the return to form of many classic acts
8273095 while the rest of the music business tries to get excited about the ning nang nongs and the rama lama ding dongs rock has become the most vibrant and vital musical genre
8273096 were you in this campaign just for me were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators we need a president who understands that we cant solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy

8273099 establishing fair and effective criminal justice systems is essential if the rule of law is to be established in countries affected by violent conflict in particular in post conflict situations where un operations are established

8273101 although there was no association between presence of depressive symptoms and risk of stroke in women men with depressive symptoms were at increased risk of subsequent stroke and ischemic stroke compared with men without depressive symptoms
8273102 nonbiological or hormonal factors without somatic consequences may play a larger role in women than in men
8273103 perhaps more so if depressive symptoms cannot be attributed to depressive disorder the presence of depressive symptoms is not a risk factor for stroke in women
8273104 longitudinal studies with a longer follow up and a more detailed phenomenological description of depressive symptoms will be instrumental to prove this hypothesis

8273108 leed has been frequently criticized for not having a solid rationale for allocating credits
8273109 the classic example is you get one point for putting in bicycle lockers and showers and one point for saving 7 percent of energy are those equivalent benefits
8273110 we are saying climate change is the most important thing so we put the most points to credits that deal with climate change
8273111 if you want to get certified you have to focus on those areas
8273112 this is the best way possible to give responsibility to chapters theyre the ones who know the local issues without jeopardizing the consistency of leed overall
8273113 there is a tension between having a national system and yet still allowing a lot of regional differences
8273114 a solution is for leed 2012 were not ready to make that big of a leap

8273123 molecular profiling studies have identified subtypes of breast cancer that can be approximately classified by estrogen receptor er progesterone receptor pr and her 2 neu her 2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression
8273124 these molecular subtypes are prognostically significant but to the authors knowledge differences in their etiologic profiles have not been established reproductive factors may plausibly be differentially correlated with the risk of different breast cancer subtypes because these factors are presumed to impact exposure to endogenous sex hormones
8273125 certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on the risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared with others
8273126 future studies that further define the etiology of breast cancer subtypes will add to the biologic understanding of this disease
8273127 although definitive conclusions regarding which risk factors are more strongly related to certain molecularly defined subtypes of breast cancer cannot be made based on the current study our data do support the premise that risk factor profiles vary by breast cancer subtype and that hormonal risk factors have a greater impact on luminal type breast cancers than her 2 overexpressing or triple negative tumors
8273128 the observation that breastfeeding has now been shown to reduce the risk of triple negative disease in 2 studies is intriguing but the biologic basis for this association is unclear and this finding requires further replication given the well defined clinical differences between breast tumor subtypes the relatively poor prognoses of her 2 overexpressing and triple negative disease and the paucity of existing epidemiologic data further research is needed to clarify the epidemiology of these tumors because at the current time no consistent risk factors for either of these 2 subtypes have been identified

8273152 we believe that a radical review of the technology curriculum in schools is essential bringing together the views of employers and academics to create an inspiring curriculum that is attractive to students and is valued for progression to university and to employment

8273154 we are very pleased to note the increase in the number of students sitting a level maths which is highly valued by both universities and employers for students proposing to enter it related degrees or careers
8273155 the continued decline in the number of students choosing it related a levels and gcses highlights a serious issue for the uk
8273156 to compete in the technology intensive globalised economy we need an inspiring curriculum in schools that attracts increasing numbers of talented students into technology related degrees and careers

8273175 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8273176 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8273177 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8273178 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8273179 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8273180 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment

8273242 far reaching and long term benefits to fairfax with the prospect of changing work practices and culture throughout the group
8273243 it is worth recalling that 85 per cent of our earnings are derived from businesses located in oecd organisation for economic co operation and development countries
8273244 the reality is that by 2012 over 80 per cent of our expansion is derived by brownfields expansions and growth in existing regions such as the pilbara and quebec
8273245 they have spoken about their strong growth in the near term but i think they may need to revise those forecasts at some stage
8273246 estimates of project timelines move back and forth as they progress through the normal stages of feasibility studies and approvals and this is quite normal
8273247 given their number we are not reliant on any one particular project to determine our growth
8273248 we have successfully positioned the company to benefit from the full ownership of a business with a substantial presence in the australian retail sector with quality management quality brands and an enviable property footprint
8273249 flat or negative economic growth in the june quarter obviously is a serious risk
8273250 around the world today governments are dealing with the most challenging global economic conditions since the early 1990s
8273251 the good news is that we are in a far better position than all of these countries because our underlying economic fundamentals are strong
8273252 the downside surprises on engineering and non residential construction work mean the risk of a flat or slightly negative economic growth print next wednesday has risen
8273253 it has to be a risk that if national domestic demand is fairly flat that you could see parts of australia where you have slight declines and nsw would be a possibility
8273254 our roads are quite robust in terms of traffic projections
8273255 it would be a good asset in our portfolio but the key thing would be at what price
8273256 we have decided to describe the last 12 months as annus horribilis it reflects what has happened to us at rex and what has happened to the aviation industry more broadly
8273257 but we have been able to alleviate some of the difficulties we experienced in the first half we shrank the operations of the business to match the number of pilots we had at the time
8273258 browse is big and it is costly and it is higher co2 reservoir content
8273259 if the current discussion paper does not get it correct we will need to dramatically reduce the spending on browse in 2009 and beyond
8273260 we had a steady start to the 2009 financial year
8273261 were cautious in looking forward to the next 12 months and thats just reflecting the fact that the national economy is a little bit tighter but the thing that gives us confidence is that resilience in local revenues
8273262 we think poverty is only being hungry naked and homeless the poverty of being unwanted unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty we must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty
8273263 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing
8273264 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland
8273265 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8273266 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8273267 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8273268 i have one more player in mind and then that is the end of it for a few months at least
8273269 we believe it is evident that mff is avoiding the worst of the numerous disasters in the financial sector
8273270 i told the board of directors you could eat off the floor of the place
8273271 i think at 20 years it is time for me to set the lead and say to the others you work out what you want to do after that
8273272 i reckon between now and 2010 we are going to have two of our best years
8273273 there has been a lot of questions especially from the us as to why macquarie had been holding up recently after what has happened to babcock amp brown and that sooner or later the negative sentiment was going to flow through to them
8273274 quite a bit of it is people catching up with what has gone on at babcock
8273275 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet
8273276 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8273277 no big deal we was just foolin around a little harmless fun
8273278 everything has become more expensive now including pizza for people who need to watch what they spend
8273279 in naples and elsewhere in italy that should be enough to cover costs and give a profit margin without damaging quality
8273280 i think were nearly there we still have one or two pending issues
8273281 we are working hard to finalise the agreement in singapore but even if we dont finalise i think we are nearly there
8273282 for indonesia the question is more about timing we are still negotiating on the timelines
8273283 the asean india deal is done we will announce it it is finalised and ready to be signed by december
8273284 now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god an eternal house in heaven not built by human hands
8273285 i run in the path of your commands for you have set my heart free

8273289 ive been up and down the road in discussions with my ex wife dina and its to the point now that im going to confront samantha and jenny muro lindsays production assistant myself
8273290 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse

8273293 the asset and funds management industry is still young but due to the vast wealth concentration in the region we can expect the gcc to become an international centre for asset management in the next decade managed funds and in particular sharia compliant funds are attracting a wave of new more sophisticated investors
8273294 as international interest in the mena region continues to grow dubais aspirations of becoming a centre for global trade is fast becoming a reality regional wealth is being reinvested in the middle east and the role of fund management has become more prominent in just four years difc has succeeded in attracting some of the leading and most respected names in the global banking industry
8273295 the middle east is predicted to be the fastest growing region for high net worth individual hnwi assets with mutual fund penetration rates at very low levels across the gcc there are tremendous opportunities for growth
8273296 a visible trend in the gulf region during the period 2005 2006 was the large participation in the stock market run with almost no diversification of the asset base given the volatile nature of equity markets in the current backdrop mutual funds can act as a good vehicle for diversified investment especially for small household investors and funds with no front end fees
8273297 its pure evasion of what plainly are issues of widespread abuses of migrant workers and the inability of the philippine government to protect us the proposed mandatory psychiatric test is an insane plan of a government that whitewashes its inutility
8273298 are mad to think that ofws who suffered mental breakdown abroad have pre existing mental problems before they left the country
8273299 this is so typical of this government who never made protection of ofws a real and concrete program
8273300 the proponents of this scheme are the ones who should have their heads examined rampant abuses exploitative working situations instituted anti migrant policies and the lack of political will and actions of the philippine government to alleviate the condition of ofws are the ones that drive us to desperation
8273301 if we can tap our water for hydro power irrigation and potable water it would be very good
8273302 my interest at the moment is on the small scale plants for small towns because once you put them in place you can develop good potable water
8273303 the big projects are five to 10 years down the track because you would not get support for a very big project without a lot of very extensive properly recorded data made over several seasons
8273304 if we had to pay him for his work it would cost us millions of dollars
8273305 the report only shows that pagasa wasnt remiss in its duty contrary to what sulpicio lines has been trying to show weather branch chief nathaniel cruz jr said in an interview

8273316 we have killed one of the three militants but now we are appealing them to release the hostages
8273317 we will lift the curfew in phases to ensure there is no law and order problem
8273318 i dont think its going to show much change at all
8273319 id love to say that they shoppers did pick up on the inquirys findings that it failed to find the retailers were causing inflation and that it found workable competition we were thrilled that the accc found what we believed to be the case
8273320 we looked at many different countries and we found that line to be the best in the world
8273321 a supermarket that can have this positioning and live up to it is excelling in an area the customer needs them to excel in to be a supermarket brand focused on fresh food and have a point in difference in that is going to be the one that they will lean towards
8273322 como estamos pr ximos a las revocatorias municipales 7 de diciembre pensamos que podr an unirse con el refer ndum para evitar gastos mayores al estado
8273323 there has been an explosion particularly in the entertainment world of magazines and websites for hollywood
8273324 its a global phenomenon in the media world and it even creeps onto the front pages of broadsheets now whereas 10 years ago it didnt
8273325 the healthiest magazine circulations worldwide at the moment are celebrity magazines the trends within this market may ebb and flow at times street photography and the paparazzi wane a bit when people want to see their favourite celebrities looking nice but overall the demand seems insatiable
8273326 its a balance if you like to the overkill of pop and celebrity
8273327 there is an incredible amount of clutter in the world
8273328 in order to get on those lists they agencies have to be able to demonstrate both capability and prices they the previous administration didnt exactly have a transparent process in how people came to be on that list theres a widespread suspicion within the industry that the political preferences of the government influenced who was able to get access to work and who was not
8273329 no one will be able to say that our process is not transparent we want to create a level playing field for those who want to get work
8273330 i have no interest in rewarding anybody my objective is to have an open and transparent system a level playing field people will live or die according to their merits
8273331 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system
8273332 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8273333 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8273334 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication
8273335 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8273336 females are the front line purchasers which makes them more sensitive to the actual cost of things
8273337 when theres not enough money it affects their wellbeing very quickly
8273338 theres a false sense of security thats certainly been evident
8273339 it gradually dawns on men that theres not enough money for a meal at a restaurant and then it has a knock on effect on their wellbeing
8273340 the economic situation has been so stable during the survey
8273341 now the cpi figures are just looking worse and worse
8273342 we are not seeing what certain people are indicating in the current australian economic situation
8273343 our growth for the month of july has continued from the path of where it did in the last financial year and that in itself gives us a lot of confidence
8273344 a lot of the tv stations are flat in ways because the price of their media has increased and the audience has decreased so people have found other ways to do it
8273345 its an argument ive heard more this year than ive heard it in any other year since ive been doing this
8273346 they are strongly engaged with political issues and social causes such as the environment poverty health and an australian republic
8273347 however they feel alienated and marginalised by old formal institutionalised politics
8273348 young australians are distrustful of politicians and they are not content to accept the hierarchies in traditional institutions of democracy
8273349 they prefer to engage in grassroots campaigns and cause based activities where they feel like they can make a difference
8273350 what weve seen from this literature review is that there are gaps in the research
8273351 there are no specific studies on what young people would like democracy to look like there is little if any research assessing the impact of young peoples political activities
8273352 the ratings downgrade reflects gpts challenging liquidity profile due to debt maturity by march 2009 and which has been further constrained by limited headroom over covenants in its debt documents
8273353 we must respond if we want to improve access to capital and cost of capital the proper response will see the intrinsic value of gpts underlying assets recognised
8273354 weve got to see some fallout on the chinese economy because china is such an important exporter to europe japan and the us
8273355 as soon as the market focused almost entirely on global growth the aussie became a bit of a victim to concerns about commodity price pressures
8273356 we probably have seen the best conditions for the australian dollar because whilst you could see oil and food prices climb higher were not going to see the pace of appreciation like earlier this year

8273396 i know i can do these things i just had to put my mind to it and buckle down
8273397 i was basing my season on working hard every day and taking it from there

8273399 i usually pump guys up too much and they break our hearts
8273400 but hes really worked hard hes had a good camp
8273401 as long as i just keep working at it i can be better
8273402 you just line up at a different position line up a little bit farther inside than outside thats it

8273407 expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results
8273408 we believe we have been able to correlate the results to particular shale qualities which greatly encourage us that a predictive model can be created the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two wells in the liard shales make this test very interesting
8273409 we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin

8273606 i want to stress that these countries are involved in south ossetian peoples genocide
8273607 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8273608 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8273609 our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 reflect difficult market conditions for our industry
8273610 while retail and export demand for chicken remained relatively strong during the quarter casual dining and food service customers have been affected by a significant decline in restaurant traffic due to weak economic conditions and higher fuel prices
8273611 the combination of much higher costs and the imbalance between domestic supply and demand in the food service markets resulted in much lower margins
8273612 in spite of challenging market conditions we are pleased with the progress made toward moving to full production at our newest facility in waco texas
8273613 while everything will be in place to move to full production at the new plant by october the plant will operate at approximately 90 percent capacity until market conditions warrant moving to full production
8273614 for the remainder of fiscal 2008 we believe market prices will continue to reflect soft consumer demand trends and the uncertain economic outlook
8273615 however having been through volatile cycles we remain confident that the fundamental rules of supply and demand will work to maintain industry profitability over the long term
8273616 there was no price relief in our key input costs in the fourth quarter
8273617 in fact just the opposite occurred with july corn futures reaching all time highs of over 7 50 per bushel in late june and may wheat futures reaching nearly 9 00 per bushel
8273618 this directly impacted our reported results for the fourth quarter and even to a greater extent than we witnessed in the third quarter
8273619 fortunately natural gas prices have retreated to around 8 00 per million btus from a recent high of nearly 13 00 per million btus
8273620 while we expect to benefit from these lower energy costs in coming quarters we are continuing to pursue plans for the installation of a coal boiler cogeneration facility at our pekin il plant which has the potential to generate significant energy savings starting in 2011 if all goes as anticipated
8273621 the major impact on our results for all of fiscal 2008 was from commodity inflation namely the record high prices for corn and wheat combined with the hike in natural gas prices
8273622 corn and wheat prices for the year averaged 37 6 percent and 63 3 percent higher respectively above our fiscal 2007 levels while the price of natural gas averaged 14 8 percent higher than the average price of natural gas during the prior year
8273623 the substantial rise in natural gas prices occurred as oil prices exceeded over 140 per barrel for a time during the latter part of fiscal 2008
8273624 recently oil prices have declined to a range of approximately 115 to 120 per barrel and as a result natural gas prices have also trended down
8273625 as we previously stated we are transforming mgpi into a leading u s producer of specialty proteins and starches as well as high quality food grade alcohol
8273626 this has been no small feat as we completely reconfigured our ingredient technology platforms around our customers
8273627 we narrowed our product lines to drive to a higher value mix
8273628 we also took the opportunity to rationalize our manufacturing footprint which as previously reported involved the write down of plant and equipment associated with the manufacturing of pet related products and certain of our wheatex r textured wheat proteins that in the future we plan to produce through third parties these actions in total are geared to improving our long term profits and cash flows at the same time the structural and business process changes have created a strong foundation for enabling new growth opportunities in our respective business segments

8273637 by proposing to ban uranium mining the premier and state alp government is effectively robbing one of the most poor and disenfranchised people in this country of the right to earn a living and potentially achieve an equity stake in a major mining project

8273641 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

8273677 we are also the technology provider for the first iptv service in india and we strive to remain at the core of indias broadband growth
8273678 as suppliers continue to work towards overcoming supply and demand constraints changing market dynamics are forcing suppliers to change strategies to move towards offering more end to end services or hold their leadership positions
8273679 because few suppliers today have end to end s2p source to pay service capabilities they are making concerted efforts to round out their capabilities through acquisitions partnerships and internal enhancements
8273680 po suppliers are expanding their delivery footprint across onshore in region and offshore delivery locations
8273681 while sourcing focused suppliers are onshore centric and p2p focused suppliers tend to focus on offshore centric models end to end suppliers have developed a healthy mix of onshore in region and offshore ftes almost all po suppliers are beginning to optimize their location strategies as global sourcing starts to play an increasingly important role in the po market

8273684 there are very few test and measurement suppliers who produce instruments that can meet our exacting requirements from sata 3gbps and 6gbps and ddr timing measurements to general purpose lab measurements
8273685 we selected the tektronix products for their powerful triggering capabilities unique dpx technology large display general ease of use and the probing system which uses solder in tips and digital signal processing overall we found the tektronix offerings provide the best available signal integrity for our demanding applications
8273686 we are very pleased that izt decided to invest in our award winning high performance digital phosphor oscilloscopes to meet the exacting test and measurement requirements of their advanced telecommunications development projects

8273689 whats more we want to reassure the parents that when it comes to their childrens dreams they dont need to rely on anyone else other than self to make it true thats where sar utha ke jiyo starts becoming really meaningful to the target segment
8273690 we are not selling dreams through our ad we have shown a small child aspiring for an expensive profession and subconsciously assuming that her dad may not be able to support her she instantly figures out a solution her well to do uncle the penny drops at this moment as this is capable of hurting any parents pride so we are actually shaking them up by showing a very natural day to day instance that can occur to anyone the dad in the tvc reassures his child by saying that he has actually planned for her future thus heightening the moment of self respect which the brand stands for

8273907 i can honestly say andy reid is among the most boring conference calls that i can recall in the 20 some odd years ive been doing this
8273908 its very easy compared to what i get at home here sometimes theres only one or two people there it amazes me every year i do it it is quite easy and it allows me to get a few jabs in on the new york media thats probably my most fun call because i can tell them theyre a bunch of sissies compared to the philadelphia media
8273909 weve had it 10 12 years now thats when it started getting big in the league
8273910 my friends it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8273911 ultimately it is the willingness of the banking sector to make new construction loans that makes future construction activity possible
8273912 the ability to finance construction in turn depends on the quality of the banks balance sheet unfortunately georgia has been hard hit by the credit crisis with a proportion of unprofitable lending institutions currently at 25 percent almost double the national rate
8273913 i expect job losses to continue at a somewhat heavy rate for the rest of the year and anticipate a net loss of 35 300 jobs for calendar year 2008
8273914 in 2009 well see the decline slow to 2 600 losses before the recovery strengthens in 2010 where we can expect to see 61 700 new jobs
8273915 we are all born and someday well all die most likely to some degree alone our aloneness in this world is maybe not anymore a thing to mourn maybe it has to do with freedom what if our aloneness isnt a tragedy tragic passing of love affairs and causes and communities and peer groups what if our aloneness is what allows us to speak the truth without being afraid what if our aloneness is what allows us to adventure to experience the world as a dynamic presence as a changeable interactive thing

8273917 the secretary general urged the parties to the conflict to rapidly return to the negotiating table and continue working together in the same positive spirit that led to the conclusion of the agreement
8273918 the parties need to preserve and build upon the accomplishments so far achieved in a bid to reach the just and durable peace desired by all
8273919 we urge president arroyo and the milf to resume the peace talks and put an end to the fighting in mindanao
8273920 the focus of our talks shall shift from the armed groups to the communities the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between the constitutionality and public sentiment
8273921 in spite of all that is happening in mindanao we remain focused on our goals and that is to achieve lasting peace in mindanao
8273922 the moa memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain should not be viewed as an end in itself but rather a tool to reinforce agreement on the principles and a roadmap for greater self governance of the bangsamoro people
8273923 we moved from bar to bar until 11pm and then went to a club where we would stay until 2am
8273924 we would drink solidly with a break at 7pm for dinner we all drank about 10 pints of lager and seven or eight bottles of alcopops
8273925 mark seemed fine he was a bit drunk on occasion but was certainly not paralytic
8273926 he was doubled over in pain i got him in the car he was obviously in great pain he was writhing about

8273938 gunshot residue tests are done in almost every case where a shooting has taken place
8273939 the main focus of our research is to develop a method that will help credibility of gunshot residue evidence in court you can get results with this test in 30 to 40 minutes with the new test in addition you only need small amounts of evidence to run the test
8273940 when a gun fires the gunpowder explodes producing gases at enormous pressure that propels the bullet out of the barrel of the firearm
8273941 some of the residue from that explosion is deposited on the hands of the shooter and the clothing of the victim
8273942 when you have a residue particle no matter how small its going to contain signatures of every element in that powder
8273943 you would just look for the one little piece of metal that might be there so the analysis could take hours
8273944 if youre looking for powder however theres a lot more of it youre getting more of the residue to analyze it makes it a much more efficient method of detection
8273945 many chemical cleaners anything that can be used to take off motor oil or freight dust will test positive for gunshot residue using the griess test
8273946 the worst thing you can possibly say is theres a chance im wrong our preliminary results indicate you can determine the presence of gunshot residue with a high level of confidence
8273947 the biggest lie people like me tell people like you is that if you vote for me i will solve all your problems the truth is you have the power

8273959 and im appreciative of that kind of attention and support wherever it comes from
8273960 i dont think were going back to jail i can tell you that much
8273961 i dont think therell be a third prison break i think michael and lincoln have been pawns in this very deadly game of chess long enough and its time to stand and fight so its time for the boys to team up with old allies and enemies and take on the company the conspiracy that destroyed their lives in the first place
8273962 hes just a fighter hes the guy that brings the grunt that male testosterone element to the show lincs going to do what he keeps doing hes a angry dude and hes just trying to get back to his kid and trying to just start a new relationship with sophia hes tired of this bullshit that people keep drawing him back to
8273963 i honestly felt that thats where my character lived and breathed where he was at his strongest with the most concrete sense of purpose it was during the second season that i felt he spun out a little bit as a character which is why i was relieved to find him back behind bars third season this season its less about being reactive and more about being proactive michaels at his best when he has a plan and hes got a pretty awesome assemblage of people around him helping him take on the conspiracy i really feel that the fourth season with my character might be one of the strongest yet
8273964 were being forced by the government to work for them and if we dont work for them theyre going to send us to jail back to prison they promised the troupe the gang that if we get the stuff done well be given our freedom so depending on how long they want the show to last we wont be having our freedom for a very long time
8273965 were working on the fox lot and were also taking as much advantage as we can of los angeles in terms of its very sort of schizophrenic terrain
8273966 you got the ocean you got downtown you got the mountains you got the desert our environment our backdrop has always been critical to the shows look and success and our number one priority is to keep that going fourth season
8273967 whats kind of become apparent is in the last four years ive been on the road and ive missed a lot of their growth
8273968 that kind of freaked me out a bit but now that im home its wonderful its really good
8273969 i was in israel france sweden italy and then germany on a separate trip
8273970 i think thats been one of the most pleasurable experiences working on this kind of show is that obviously we have a tremendous amount of appreciation for our american audience but our international appeal is not to be underestimated in france the show is huge and walking down the streets of paris felt a little bit like being a rock star it was fun
8273971 for me surfings just about having fun and hanging out with my friends out there and catching some waves
8273972 prison break keeps me so active that i kind of collapse once the seasons over
8273973 i just look forward to sitting on my couch and maybe take an occasional hike but thats pretty much it not very ambitious
8273974 thats one of the best parts that 90 of the stunts we get to execute ourselves
8273975 its always in the safest most rehearsed environment and to be hoisted up on a rope attached to a helicopter and dangled above the prison yard like we were in season three thats a thrill its one of the reasons i got into this business to begin with we all got scrapes and pulled shoulders and bruises and bloody noses but thats just the small price you pay
8273976 i run i jump over cars i fall i popped some did a shoulder injury here and i hurt my foot badly about two weeks ago running down the stairs its just part of the deal
8273977 i was wrestling with finding some way to help with the building of an orphanage
8273978 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8273979 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8273980 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8273981 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8273982 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8273983 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8273984 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8273985 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8273986 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8273987 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8273988 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8273989 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8273990 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8273991 these agreements with gcl silicon will greatly strengthen our silicon pipeline and support our capacity and production expansion over the next five years
8273992 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8273993 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8273994 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8273995 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8273996 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8273997 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8273998 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8273999 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8274000 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8274001 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
8274002 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
8274003 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
8274004 sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences
8274005 russias invasion of georgia represents the most serious challenge to this political order since slobodan milosevic unleashed the demons of ethnic nationalism in the balkans
8274006 this means reinvigorating nato as a military alliance not just a political one

8274040 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
8274041 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
8274042 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

8274056 the challenge in personal robotics engineering is keeping costs low part of that is to fit complex software into as small an arm processor as possible with even lower cost arm processors handling subsystems of the robot
8274057 we could see x86 based processors such as intels atom competing against various arm based solutions these processors are on their way to ramping up in mobile devices and in home consumer electronics and will be applicable to lower cost personal robotics as well as shipments of such processors grow their falling prices would make them increasingly attractive we would likely see very small lower power x86 processors used as the main processors alongside arm processors
8274058 our hope continues to be that we will resolve the matter amicably with the faa however long that takes

8274069 often they were large items such as television sets dvd players and other electrical equipment
8274070 sometimes he used a trolley to wheel goods out of the store
8274071 unfortunately he fell in with people who used drugs and he then declined into heroin use
8274072 he was quickly fired when his employer caught him stealing from pub tills
8274073 he then lapsed into crime to get money for drugs
8274074 i suppose its is a case of being bold walking out carrying something large rather than sneaking around with something hidden in your pocket
8274075 more and more parents are complaining when their children suffer even minor injuries
8274076 parents need to accept that a part of growing up is that theres a bit of rough and tumble in life accidents happen
8274077 obviously if serious accidents happen and there is negligence involved then its legitimate to complain its legitimate to make a claim
8274078 i think we have become a very over legislated society where there is little room to move to initiate your own ideas because there are just so many rules and regulations
8274079 what will kids have left to do i think its fine if im looking after dakoda but she can play by herself when shes older and its ok for kids to play those games if theres teachers around
8274080 kids need to have a few bumps and knocks to learn become resilient to learn to cope with setbacks so it is possible to mollycoddle kids in a way that actually depowers children
8274081 to have a world where children arent allowed to climb arent allowed to jump arent allowed to skip and do cartwheels i think is far too restrictive
8274082 ive got some reservations about you and only time will tell if you can stay out of jail
8274083 nguyen gets picked up one week and gets picked up a week later doing the same thing
8274084 i know i myself have got into more than enough trouble with this group but still in queensland we have this reluctance to participate in what has been a very important group
8274085 i have no qualms in saying i have just returned from canberra playing at royal canberra golf course where one of the most important things was playing against the diplomats
8274086 there were diplomats there from belgium japan indonesia and it is very important
8274087 we try really hard not to put elderly people in chairs but weve had a situation recently where weve had to put elderly people with pneumonia in chairs for 12 hours or so because we didnt have a bed
8274088 its awful its the worst its been for years were powerless to do anything
8274089 staff are being pushed to the limits it is a bottleneck it is a shambles and it is only going to get worse
8274090 we havent been able to get a private patient into a private hospital for weeks theyre full too
8274091 im not sure suspending elective surgery for a week would be enough it might take two
8274092 what i do expect is hospital management to make decisions on a daily basis about what is in the best interests of providing safe patient care
8274093 if that means theyve got to temporarily suspend elective surgery then unfortunately if that decision is made in the interests of patient safety i support that i would rather that not be the case but thats the reality of the very busy times we are experiencing at the moment
8274094 it certainly adds to the case for the reserve bank to consider the amount of cost pressures on households and alleviate some of those pressures by cutting rates next month
8274095 it shows people have a capacity to absorb additional financial pressures in their lives but only up to a point

8274097 if you go for an overly prescriptive regime then that might leave a whole set of circumstances that you might not contemplate being caught or not caught so this has quite a wide ranging application
8274098 giving a glass of wine at the table with the family with a meal to a child who is 17 and they have one glass served by a sober parent then clearly you would say that is not irresponsible supply
8274099 i expect that this will have a number of effects one is that parents are looking forward to having this in their armoury of debates they have with their kids and being able to point out this is what the law says

8274130 technologies that are in use today including the widely used claus process are more energy and capital intensive
8274131 in addition they also lose the hydrogen in the process instead of capturing the hydrogen from the hydrogen sulfide the claus process ends up converting it into water
8274132 if a pilot plant demonstrates that the process is a major improvement over existing technology and we believe it is it will spur the interest of industries that use a process to separate hydrogen sulfide
8274133 companies will be able to retrofit their facilities with the process technology or construct new plants that incorporate it
8274134 in the meantime we are working with argonne to use the technology for other energy applications such as gas cleanup for integrated gassification combined cycle plants

8274187 index funds have long been popular with investors because they invariably have low charges due to there being little or no fund management involved
8274188 but in this investment climate a tracker can only go one way and that is down there is little point paying low charges when you are being rewarded with below par performance
8274189 good active fund managers have been able to exploit the many factors contributing to the current downturn avoiding companies exposed to the credit crunch or relying on consumer spending and instead weighting towards mining and energy stocks
8274190 around five million investors currently hold tracking funds which are marketed as easy to understand low cost
8274191 while the actively managed funds cited in our tables are not purely uk focused the story remains the same an active fund manager can diversity into appropriate stocks to reflect the
8274192 so at least in a managed fund the investor has a fighting chance while our figures show that even the best of the actively managed funds have lost ground over the past year over the five year period the growth has been little short of spectacular for the top actively managed funds
8274193 and that is the key difference between these two radically contrasting investment styles

8274228 this is a difficult problem and there are no easy solutions i have proposed a program of mortgage replacement loans that i believe would stop the downward spiral of house prices the basic idea is to provide an incentive to stop defaults among those who now have positive equity but are vulnerable to a further price decline the federal government would offer every homeowner with a mortgage the opportunity to replace 20 per cent of that mortgage with a low interest government loan up to a loan limit of 80 000 that reflects the governments lower borrowing rate creditors would be required to accept this partial mortgage pay down and to reduce the monthly interest and principal by the same 20 per cent that mortgage replacement loan would not be collateralized by the house but would be a loan that the government could enforce by lodging a claim on an individual who does not pay
8274229 we dont have a long enough time series on the european union to estimate the parameters characterizing expansion and contraction but i wondered what would happen if you take the parameter values estimated on the basis of 60 years of u s real gdp growth rates and just apply them directly to the european data that procedure is not immune from criticism european growth rates are lower than the u s meaning that the algorithm may be a little too quick to call a recession with the european data since it is expecting to see stronger growth rates in an expansion on the other hand we know the values of these parameters pretty well for u s data and using prior information from another sample in this way can eliminate a lot of the statistical noise that would complicate an effort to start from scratch on the european data so i was interested to take a look it is interesting that the algorithm would have characterized europe as being in a recession in 2002 following the u s downturn in 2001 if you adopt my rule of making a call when the index exceeds 67
8274230 intra asia trade seems unable to offset slowing exports to the g 7 economies since most of it is actually for final exports to the g 7 and also as domestic demand in asian economies also slows demand for consumer and industrial imports and most importantly the slowdown extends from the u s to eu japan and ems like china latam so while a global recession poses risks to growth asian central banks largely behind the curve will continue to face inflation spiral loose monetary policy has resulted in negative real interest rates in india indonesia vietnam malaysia thailand singapore and philippines effect of food and fuel subsidy bill on fiscal balance would also reduce the room for expansionary fiscal policy to prop up demand moreover the recent easing of oil and commodity prices and possibility of their further downward trend amid a global slowdown especially u s and china might entice asia to believe that inflationary pressure may be abating impact of a global slowdown and commodity price correction on exports may in fact see asian countries returning to the export led growth strategy to follow a loose monetary policy and undervalued currency however this will only worsen the probability of a stagflation like environment in spite of large forex reserves the impact of these growing macro risks will worsen foreign investor sentiment posing risks to asset markets currency depreciation and financing of rising external deficits slowing surpluses
8274231 there are signs that the correction has already begun from 1 march 2007 to 1 march 2008 the value of the u s dollar declined by nearly 18 against the canadian dollar over 16 against the mexican peso by nearly 14 against the euro and by over 8 against the chinese yuan various trade weighted exchange rates reported by the imf show a u s dollar decline of 10 to 13 from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 during this same period u s merchandise exports grew 18 4 and merchandise imports grew 12 7 some of this growth is the consequence of the commodity boom but even removing soybeans corn and wheat from exports leaves growth in the remaining categories of u s exports at a hefty 16 8 moreover if imports of crude oil are taken out u s spending on imports grew by only 5 9 much larger changes than these are needed to bring the us current account into balance how much more of a dollar decline is needed depends on how adaptable the us economy is at moving resources into the production of goods that are exported or used to replace imports and on how successfully it expands the range of products it can produce and sell abroad

8274283 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8274284 its going to be something new for me but its a level playing field so im not going to fight city hall on this
8274285 a year from now when i have had a year of no toe grabs and you want to interview me i might have more to say
8274286 i saw the scientific data from the people looking to get rid of toe grabs and i must admit it was rather compelling
8274287 the problem is that no one out there has done a pro scientific study in favor of toe grabs so there is nothing to counter the very compelling videos and the very compelling scientific data that says we should go without toe grabs
8274288 i know that i claim a lot of horses off steve asmussen and todd pletcher and those guys dont use them
8274289 they seem to be doing very well without them so i just hope i still have the same continued success without them
8274290 the graded stakes committee made this rule so nyra is handcuffed because if they want their graded status they have to do what they want them to do and they dont want toe grabs
8274291 obviously they are trying to protect the horse and their heart is in the right place but i dont know how much of an effect it will really have it might cause other injuries i dont know the toe grab according to them causes injuries so i give them credit because if they can help horses what can i say on the other hand im not too sure about this i havent had any problems with this over the last 20 odd years
8274292 i dont know why all of the sudden they think that is the reason for everything
8274293 there have always been toes on the shoes even when they used steel shoes
8274294 if that is what they want and everybody does it its what you have to do everybody will be in the same boat some horses probably will be better suited to running without them it probably will depend upon the stride it certainly will save a lot of running around looking for a blacksmith
8274295 two year olds will probably be better off without toe grabs
8274296 as long as we are allowed to use something to push off behind it will be ok

8274310 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
8274311 this move by the mccain campaign completely contradicts everything john mccain stood for in 2000 when his competitors were trying to keep him off the ballot
8274312 mccain has become a part of the same corrupted machine he spoke vehemently against only eight years ago
8274313 this is america where people have a right to run for office and a right to compete for the chance to lead the people of this nation
8274314 i look forward to the chance to compete fairly against senator mccain for votes in pennsylvania and every other state
8274315 you might expect of a dictator in north korea libya china or iran
8274316 this move is certainly one of the more brazen attempts to lock me out of the political process
8274317 but it is simply just one more example of how the political establishment desperately clings to their own power instead of empowering the people the political establishment serves only themselves and not the people of this nation it is time candidates for the most powerful position in the world compete based on ideas and not dirty politics
8274318 i challenge senator mccain to forcefully and publicly instruct his agents to drop the lawsuit
8274319 the first 10 years i worked hard at establishing the business now im working hard at figuring out how to keep up

8274479 god does whatever he chooses to do whenever he chooses to do it wherever he chooses involving whomsoever he wishes to involve
8274480 i am god and there is no one like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have not been done saying my purpose will be established and i will accomplish all my good pleasure truly i have spoken truly i will bring it to pass i have planned it surely i will do it
8274481 does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth and no one can ward off his hand or say to him what has thou done
8274482 the lord does whatever pleases him in the heavens and on the earth in the seas and in their depths

8274484 are not two sparrows sold for a cent and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father
8274485 god has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires
8274486 if god has control over everything that happens is he not a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings when he wants us to dance
8274487 at no point whatsoever does the remarkable emphasis on the absoluteness of gods sovereignty mitigate the responsibility of human beings who like everything else in the universe fall under gods sway we tend to use one to diminish the other we tend to emphasize one at the expense of the other but responsible reading of the scripture prohibits such reductionism
8274488 that every careless word that men shall speak they shall render account for in the day of judgment
8274489 the conclusion when all has been heard is fear god and keep his commandments because this applies to every person for god will bring every act to judgment everything which is hidden whether it is good or evil

8274520 my dear the most important body part is your shoulder

8274544 thats why in designing the scheme the government will continue to consult with industry business and the community every step of the way
8274545 the reason for having a detailed framework out there through the green paper is to focus the debate down to the points of real disagreement and to work out what is the productive way forward

8274549 when you bring high quality space even in this environment it is actively sought after
8274550 if a company is looking to move offshore because they have large energy costs they still face substantial costs for building facilities and setting up elsewhere
8274551 and if youre going to move a facility from australia offshore purely on the basis you think theres no price on carbon coming for example in china then youre ignoring all the signs that now show there very likely will be a carbon price in china five 10 or 20 years from now
8274552 weve had a powerful start to the new financial year
8274553 we see great potential from start ups acquisitions our existing client base and we are less susceptible to economic changes because of the australian based client base
8274554 we are confident that we can capture the majority of the margin improvement that will come from the upturn in the markets through to the net profit line when those investment returns finally turn around
8274555 it is undeniable that the sharp reduction in taxes in the early 1980s was a strong impetus to economic growth
8274556 in australia following on from the strong december 2007 half driven by federal government advertising national advertising markets are being impacted by wider economic conditions as well as the olympics
8274557 nevertheless our regional markets remain resilient as they continue to benefit from the economic drivers of population migration agriculture and resources
8274558 we werent taking a three year decision when we bought alcan
8274559 we were taking a 30 year 40 year decision the world of energy is going to change and we are in a terrific position in that industry
8274560 aluminium has struggled as higher cost chinese smelters continue to be built and impact the supply demand balance and hence aluminium price
8274561 we believe the aluminium business will be well positioned for most of its smelter capacity as aluminium prices rise in the future
8274562 these are areas requiring urgent attention to improve tanzanias competitiveness particularly given its present stage of economic development
8274563 their experience and client relationships will expand our corporate capabilities in the energy and healthcare industries and we are delighted to welcome them to our team
8274564 together we will help build the growing s extensive resources to better service our clients
8274565 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8274566 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8274567 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8274568 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8274569 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8274570 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8274571 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8274572 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8274573 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8274574 but we need to prepare our members for the eventuality that they could be called on to start manning picket lines
8274575 we are optimistic that a fair and reasonable settlement will be reached before the contract expiration date
8274576 thegrades we are seeing at dutwa are easily comparable with those at many major nickel laterite deposits worldwide
8274577 the results to date coupled with the extent of the geochemical anomaly suggest a substantial nickel endowment this is a highly significant discovery the first of its type in tanzania and appears very promising
8274578 nothing had prepared me for this show even the video clips id seen
8274579 under the current market conditions its the business going as well as can be expected
8274580 i dont know if pressure is the right word in our business the way the financial world is at the moment we are constantly reviewing our position we are managing our business
8274581 at the moment we are moving forward to complete our projects and the sales are happening
8274582 at the moment yes support should continue as we finish our projects
8274583 in days like these we always have conversations with our lenders
8274584 ive heard that cutting through the roots around the drip line of a tree or shrub with a shovel can encourage it to flower is that true
8274585 it is a true start up business and we will probably make a loss in the first year but over time we want to get a reasonable share of the nt market a 20 30 per cent share over time
8274586 the agreement allows iraq to join security agreements with any other side other than the u s to preserve security in the country
8274587 the suggested agreement with the u s will not be long term but temporary and for only three years to organize the u s forces short term presence and withdrawal from iraq that is required to be completed by 2011
8274588 iraq will not hold any agreement or treaty on the basis of one foreign soldiers presence on the iraqi lands but through putting a specified timetable for the withdrawal of the foreign troops
8274589 big progress is currently taking place in the iraqi u s negotiations to put the final touches on the mutual agreement
8274590 among the pending points in the negotiations is the issue of offering unlimited immunities
8274591 open immunities cannot be given to any person whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
8274592 there is also the issue of foreign forces presence movements and bases
8274593 an agreement has been made that the end of 2011 would be the last date for foreign forces presence in iraq
8274594 meanwhile those forces are not allowed to conduct military missions unless with a clearance from the iraqi government
8274595 the agreement will be transparent and will be submitted to the iraqi parliament for approval
8274596 there will be no secrete appendixes for the agreement as some insincere politicians claim
8274597 very very close to finalizing the agreement but had not yet clinched the deal
8274598 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed

8274610 the under 21s is all about developing players as future senior internationals we wanted to give them an opportunity to play at wembley as part of that education
8274611 weve had superb attendances around the country to see the under 21s and from what the players have achieved this campaign they deserve to play in front of a big crowd at wembley
8274612 with tickets priced very sensibly hopefully we will get plenty of people there to see what should be an exciting game against formidable opposition
8274613 this newspaper will stand up and be counted and will not bow down to pressure from this powerful industry
8274614 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing

8274617 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8274618 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8274619 i have one more player in mind and then that is the end of it for a few months at least

8274625 is a self defined self determined state reached by a person able to effectively manage multiple responsibilities at work at home and in the community
8274626 role overload too much to do and not enough time to do it provides another measure of wellbeing
8274627 for example often feeling that not enough is accomplished in the day worrying about not spending enough time with family constantly feeling under stress trying to accomplish more than can be handled and cutting back on sleep are all indicators of role overload
8274628 for example just over half of all day workers cut back on sleep compared with 70 per cent of evening shift workers and 63 per cent of rotating shift workers
8274629 part of the reason why target is such a wonder company is its amazing inventory turnover a financial measure of how quickly goods move through the company
8274630 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8274631 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8274632 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8274633 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season
8274634 gareth wants to concentrate on playing on the best of his ability for aston villa and we hope this draws a line under the matter

8274639 there have been a lot of questions especially from the us as to why macquarie had been holding up recently after what has happened to babcock amp brown and that sooner or later the negative sentiment was going to flow through to them

8274644 come annunciato in campagna elettorale dice il neo sindaco di centrodestra giuseppe alfano eletto a giugno abbiamo ripristinato la denominazione dellinfrastruttura che ere stata intestata a magliocco fin dalla sua costruzione avvenuta fra il 1937 e il 1939
8274645 come rileva un sondaggio effettuato a suo tempo dice il sindaco lintitolazione a la torre aveva riscontrato scarso gradimento fra i cittadini
8274646 fa parte di unantica consuetudine siciliana uccidere le persone due volte prima fisicamente e poi nella memoria
8274647 vincenzo magliocco aggiunge digiacomo il vecchio nome dellaeroporto militare e non centra nulla con la nuova destinazione civile dello scalo inoltre e non una considerazione secondaria anche su comiso oltre che su sigonella la torre fece le sue grandi battaglie pacifiste
8274648 siamo di fronte ad un atto impregnato di ignoranza e arroganza politica lintitolazione dellaeroporto di comiso a pio la torre era stata una scelta legata allimpegno per la pace e contro la mafia al di l di ogni colore e schieramento non capire ci significa non comprendere un pezzo importantissimo della nostra storia recente
8274649 considero la scelta di cambiare nome allaeroporto di comiso fatta dal sindaco alfano offensiva e inaccettabile
8274650 offensiva aggiunge nei confronti della storia siciliana della memoria di pio la torre e di ci che questa figura ha rappresentato inaccettabile perch non comprendiamo le motivazioni che hanno portato a questa decisione ci sembra anzi che lunica motivazione reale sia quella di un vero e proprio atto di arroganza politica cancellare il nome di una figura come pio la torre ucciso dalla mafia che non rappresenta solo una parte politica ma la storia migliore della sicilia una scelta scellerata
8274651 in sicilia conclude finocchiaro tira una brutta aria di revisionismo storico dopo le targhe nelle piazze ora vogliono cambiare i nomi agli aeroporti cancellando la storia siciliana la destra sappia che noi glielo impediremo

8274680 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8274681 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8274682 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8274683 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8274684 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8274685 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
8274686 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
8274687 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
8274688 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
8274689 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
8274690 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8274691 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8274692 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8274693 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8274694 borussia dortmund have signed the 97 times capped south korea international young pyo lee from english premier league side tottenham
8274695 the operation took place at the hampshire clinic in basingstoke and was performed by james calder a consultant orthopaedic surgeon specialist in foot and ankle surgery
8274696 the same surgeon operated on former pompey player pedro mendes last season when he had a similar injury
8274697 blues club doctor nigel sellars attended the operation along with the orthopaedic surgeon to the croatia national team
8274698 he will wear a non weight bearing case for three weeks before beginning rehabilitation weeks
8274699 of course hell fight if he was doing drugs if he had been drunk if he had gone out there and done what he did because he was pissed off at someone that would be a completely different story but he was ill and in this company we support our friends and anyone who works for us when theyre ill and have problems he was ill the incident occurred and now hes fine rampage feels awful about the womans baby but he had nothing to do with it and the traffic incident occurred because he was very ill and not with him in control of his faculties
8274700 i didnt know anything about shogun i was trying to get wanderlei silva i was told i might be fighting him but to be honest with you i dont really give a damn who i fight i just want to fight and show the world that rampage is the best when he gets the best elements around him and the best training
8274701 i told her with a little luck that she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
8274702 i had my friends from planned parenthood give me a bunch of condoms because i feel i need to protect myself from john mccain as a woman
8274703 because we are not the biggest nation in the world we are not blessed with huge numbers to pick and choose from
8274704 so to have your better players available is always useful we have a nice solid squad with good experience in the right positions
8274705 we also have young energetic talent and i am more than happy with the group i have picked
8274706 we will be looking for good performances and two wins but to achieve them we need to be focused 100 both on and off the pitch
8274707 it is a huge challenge for david and he will be looking forward to that
8274708 one thing you know is that when he is with northern ireland he loves training and performing
8274709 david is his own man with his own style of play he is a clever player
8274710 as for steven he did well in the second half of last season on loan at rangers he looked to be enjoying his football again and that is always important
8274711 i am glad the situations regarding david and steven have been put to be bed it is good for them and good for us
8274712 i am delighted to have him in the squad because of way he performed against scotland
8274713 hopefully being part of group will help him get over the disappointment of being sent off which i thought was very harsh
8274714 he has been been with our under 21s and is doing well for his club
8274715 it will be good experience for jonathan and it also gives me a chance to have a close look at him
8274716 whenever i had a bad day as a kid like any other child i would drift away into my own fantasy world where everything i wanted was available to me i revisit that world of total freedom and no limits as a adult where im in charge and there are no rules if i was on a island and could take a few things
8274717 her mother had said the colour of the eye had been changing
8274718 she had an idea that something was wrong already but she had no idea that it could be cancer
8274719 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8274720 this is a consequence of the governments obsession with policing on the cheap as well as their staggering complacency towards the extension of surveillance
8274721 accredited persons have a key role to play in the delivery of neighbourhood policing and are an important part of the extended police family
8274722 it took a little while but some memory from his pup hood eventually seemed to surface and he came for a closer inspection
8274723 once hed had a sniff and then slid over the top of it for the first time he found he actually likes it
8274724 we dont think it will be long now before sahara is a proper ice loving alaskan seal again
8274725 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8274726 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him he was saying just do it just do it
8274727 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8274728 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8274729 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8274730 hey debra this is kim from soccer we just wanted to let you know that youre going to be on our team again this year

8274735 religious agendas have influenced our public policy at an alarming rate in the past few years from taxpayer funded faith based initiatives to attempts to teach creationism in our childrens science classrooms to ballot initiatives that would force other peoples religious dogma on all of us

8274740 before the end of this year we shall give the medical school a grant of over 300 000 euros for capacity building to help them prepare for the trials

8274745 this is not new it happened last year it could happen again
8274746 it is high time to find a lasting solution for kalma camp
8274747 confirmed information about the arrival of big quantities of weapons into the camp
8274748 the police force was compelled to respond to the attacking elements but not more than seven citizens at the displaced camp were injured
8274749 we dont have the required force to increase but we are doing our utmost
8274750 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
8274751 i never really suspected you might be one of the wolves what was it that made you come to me tonight
8274752 while the alleged presence of weapons in the kalma camp is a real security concern for the government of sudan authorities the actions taken to address it are a clear violation of the darfur peace agreement
8274753 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the government of sudan security forces against civilians which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties
8274754 that the presence of weapons voids the status of idp camps granted to them by international humanitarian law and exhorts the idp community and its leaders and representatives to ensure that their camps are and remain weapons free zones
8274755 up in denver and if these folks dont come in for a landing the partys hopes for a historic victory in the fall may dissipate in the clouds
8274756 we had hoped that this was the final day in nairobi but the political parties have thrown us off balance as we expected them today tuesday we will however be closing all our public hearings in nairobi tomorrow afternoon wednesday and embark on writing our report
8274757 we are ready willing and we will go we were just waiting for the opportunity to go there and give whatever information that we have
8274758 we were told the sessions had taken longer than they expected and that is why i was surprised to hear of the summons
8274759 there is nothing like an ultimatum because it is us who agreed to testify and we will do that tomorrow wednesday
8274760 hes also the first chinese special envoy to visit southern sudan
8274761 its the first high level delegation to come from china to come and visit southern sudan
8274762 many chinese companies would like to come here to look for chances and opportunities for cooperation
8274763 in this case i am also sure the southern sudan government would assist or support them to settle down to do their business while here
8274764 china is playing a very important role in development throughout the sudan particularly in the northern part where they have carried out very successful projects
8274765 with the stability in southern sudan the chinese government has decided they need to be here in juba so that they can assist in the implementation of the peace process especially in the area of coordinated development of southern sudan to enhance development

8274771 he fell behind the wrong crowd and he just did some wrong things but we all make mistakes and he didnt deserve for the chicago police to take his life he didnt deserve it he was just a regular kid
8274772 handfull sic of negative stories on just of few of our reports
8274773 his distribution is very good he doesnt waste many passes
8274774 there wasnt any need for an x ray because the swelling had gone down and he wasnt in any pain
8274775 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8274776 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved

8274778 in england people dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they work so hard they only talk to people at lunch then in the evening they watch tv so they can get up early for work the next day
8274779 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8274780 id like a home draw so our fans can see us play
8274781 we passed the ball well built the play up well and were quite controlled and had a lot of good moves
8274782 we only played for 10 minutes and they outplayed us for 80 so they deserve to go through
8274783 maybe we should have made some changes from saturday because the effort wasnt there tonight
8274784 we showed no kind of quality with our crosses into the box or with our finishing and so crewe deserve their victory
8274785 brians goal was superb it wouldnt do it credit to call it too little but it was certainly too late
8274786 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8274787 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8274788 he is speaking with the manager at the moment but he is settled in london
8274789 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8274790 there is always a cup shock but we dont want to be the spl team that goes out to a side from a lower division

8274803 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8274804 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8274805 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8274806 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8274807 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8274808 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8274809 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8274810 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8274811 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8274812 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8274813 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8274814 our skin cancer patients should know that they may be at increased for a wide variety of cancers like breast lung and colon and should not ignore early signs and symptoms if they occur
8274815 people who have had skin cancers should make sure they are up to date on all their screening tests
8274816 they should be up to date on their colonoscopies fecal occult blood and mammograms and pap smears
8274817 she said well then your child cant come into my house
8274818 ive had people voice their opposition to me that im ruining the herd immunity that my child would put their child at risk
8274819 someone pointed out to her that it was her choice to do that but that she was putting everyones kids in jeopardy by not having her kids vaccinated
8274820 i have no problem welcoming unvaccinated children into a play group and i have no problem with them attending school
8274821 simply put my children are vaccinated the risk is minimal i may not agree with other parents choices but theres no reason to hold that against the child
8274822 from the vaccinating parent perspective its a little infuriating because you dont know who these kids are
8274823 do i think its inappropriate to put a mark on people and kick them out from being able to participate in society yeah i think its inappropriate its inappropriate and its dangerous

8274864 we are grateful for the partnership and always look forward to the annual sidewalk sale which is helping us turn research into reality
8274865 this event brings communities together each year to increase awareness and raise critically needed funds for research of type 1 often called juvenile diabetes

8274869 it is not good enough that children have to have their cardiac surgery cancelled four five six times
8274870 we do take these issues very seriously what has been going on here has not been good enough and we are all working together to try to improve things
8274871 its about making sure we have the right frameworks so that we can take that practical action to ensure we have more icu nurses so we can open up those icu beds and keep the beds we currently have open
8274872 if theres more that we can be doing i will do more and i am committed to working with the monash medical centre and with other services across the state to boost the overall capacity
8274873 what were looking at today is shorter term responses that will solve this critical issue now
8274874 we were very lucky that the pilots skill allowed him to land the aircraft where he did
8274875 had he crashed across the road he would have gone straight into the primary school
8274876 he managed to land the aircraft in such a way as to protect the public
8274877 i saw the plane go right into the garage thank god i had ryan with me outside
8274878 it was very scary i was in such a panic and in such shock
8274879 this is not a safe environment for people living here
8274880 it chilled my blood when i heard about it and when they mentioned the school i thought oh golly whats the final report going to be
8274881 he was forced to do a spiral dive he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8274882 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont
8274883 this is a terrible tragedy and my thoughts are with the family of the pilot
8274884 at the last meeting we were told there had been 380 000 movements of aircraft in the past 12 months
8274885 thats a lot of aircraft flying around in a very small circle over what is a growing and developing community
8274886 and if they dont do that then they must lower the amount of traffic in the skies
8274887 a very high percentage of the aircraft are 30 years or older and a lot of the activity is training activity involving learners
8274888 this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8274889 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore

8274894 were in favour of an overall road user charge in the longer term but only on the basis that the arbitrary fuel excise tax and other taxes on motoring are reviewed or removed and then replaced with a road user charge
8274895 that would be both roads and public transport to address the issues of the environment and congestion
8274896 the government would then pay a yearly amount based on usage
8274897 there are indications that the existing bereavement payment claim form may not be clearly reflecting the legislation
8274898 the government will amend the claim form to provide greater clarity to health professionals about baby bonus eligibility
8274899 the company is discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8274900 our concern is the depth of the cuts at the company and the way that they are doing it
8274901 they havent been able to tell us how many editorial jobs they need to lose at
8274902 they are not even at liberty to tell us how much of the 50 million in cuts over the next two years announced yesterday have to be carried out in melbourne so we are still nervously waiting to hear what our number is
8274903 this is much more about impressing the market in the short term than a serious attempt to position the paper for five years 10 years hence
8274904 that their innocence has been lost and the circumstances of losing it is a tragedy for both of them

8274926 erst vor kurzem ist ein sehr spezieller auftrag bei uns eingegangen dabei handelte es sich um ein auf altdeutsch und teilweise in stenographie verfasstes handgeschriebenes buch ber phytotherapie die bersetzung und erfassung dieses manuskriptes war auch eine herausforderung f r uns der wir uns erfolgreich gestellt haben
8274927 man wird als externer anbieter als bel stigung empfunden und nicht als hilfe f r die arbeitslosen
8274928 dies ist aus unserer sicht nicht geeignet das vertrauen der kunden in die angebote der externen anbieter herzustellen da nebenan gleich die professionellen st nder der arbeitsagenturen mit den im einheitlichen ci gehaltenen brosch ren und der stiftbox im arbeitsamt ci stehen
8274929 da hat man dann wenig chancen sich als externer anbieter vom quasi f r den arbeitslosen kostenlosen angebot des durch steuergelder finanzierten ffentlichen wettbewerbers abzugrenzen
8274930 was wir uns als externe anbieter w nschen ist eine professionelle werbem glichkeit im eingangs und wartebereich beim arbeitsamt auch w re eine unkompliziertere genehmigung von promotions oder hausmessen ein gro er fortschritt denn auch wenn die lage am arbeitsmarkt zurzeit entspannt ist kann man immer an der verbesserung der prozesse arbeiten

8274961 and now we come to my favorite part of the season the cuts listen there are a lot of cuts i didnt get to cut everybody i wanted to but ive cut a lot of you why dont you just check the roster to see that you didnt make the cut
8274962 so the question you have is whether to stay home or get paid
8274963 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8274964 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8274965 this is the kind of question that i predict and this heas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8275026 youd think with his size hed bang people around but he was just a nice player it was never one of those deals where you thought hed get banged around by him he would pin you but in a nice way
8275027 kevin was a guy who i think most people who knew him loved him certainly the eastern contacts did ill have a family who will be greatly saddened
8275028 as i recall kevin obviously was one of my first really good players a guy who i think helped our program transition to division i
8275029 he was obviously the most recognizable guys on campus but he would talk to you it was unbelievable the guys hed talk to
8275030 he went from being paranoid of his size to being proud of his size from being afraid to sit in a classroom because everybody looked at him to liking going to a classroom because everybody talked to him
8275031 i think on court time he might have totaled five minutes before getting his fifth foul
8275032 oh boy i remember we made that trip to missouri
8275033 mizzou fans were really harsh on him they had signs that said how much does a duck weigh he was really conscious of his weight but he worked at it and became an nba all star
8275034 he turned into a really good player and he was a very nice young man
8275035 that senior year there wasnt any question but that he emerged as a potential nba draft choice which was certainly new to us
8275036 but to be honest i dont think the media caught on until the end of his career
8275037 but nonetheless once he got drafted then eastern illinois name was on the forefront and it certainly continued throughout his nba career it was a genuine american success story somewhat unheralded out of high school and ending up a two time nba all star
8275038 one of my favorite sayings was if we dont get over those screens were a dead duck
8275039 after a couple of weeks he said to me coach could you think of some other term i used to say he went from an ugly duckling to a swan
8275040 kevin was that proverbial gentle giant that everybody warmed to and i think that probably continued throughout it sounded like even at his death he was doing a basketball clinic for the trail blazers that im sure involved youth
8275041 its unfortunate that we lost a good person at such an early age
8275042 nicaragua es en efecto un pa s m s seguro que guatemala el salvador y honduras pero costa rica y panam presentan estad sticas de violencia y criminalidad m s bajas que nosotros
8275043 es un fen meno que entre otras cosas refuta aquellas tesis que asocian con m s inseguridad condiciones de m s pobreza
8275044 en el pa s la tendencia de la violencia criminal y la inseguridad ciudadana es creciente se ha pasado en seis a os de nueve homicidios por 100 mil habitantes a 13 en 10 a os la denuncia pas de 11 por 10 mil a 23 por 10 mil habitantes solamente el 20 de ese crecimiento se explica por reducci n de la cifra oscura
8275045 en nicaragua la operatividad o efectividad policial entre 2006 y 2007 baj en 11 en los delitos en general
8275046 durante la ltima d cada en toda am rica latina excepto raras excepciones ha habido un incremento sostenido de los hechos delictivos y de la percepci n de inseguridad ha bajado la tasa de
8275047 subido de tono convirti ndose en uno de los nuevos objetivos que promueven las reformas policiales y la seguridad p blica
8275048 sin esa vocaci n de sacrificio de los miembros de la polic a nacional esa condici n de seguridad ciudadana no podr a existir
8275049 lo que pasa es que hay diferencia entre lo que es la percepci n y la realidad muchas veces un solo hecho te genera una percepci n de inseguridad enorme se da un hecho de connotaci n y con el desarrollo que han tenido las comunicaciones en el mundo vos en el tiempo real est s viendo lo que est ocurriendo y la informaci n vuela a mayor velocidad
8275050 ahorita en el primer semestre de 2008 la ocurrencia delictiva presenta entre un 12 y 14 por ciento de incremento que es lo tolerable pero que adem s tiene sus razones
8275051 se han ampliado los servicios de la polic a con la apertura de m s comisar as de la mujer y la ni ez con 33 cuando antes exist an 12 hay 19 nuevas unidades municipales en lugares rec nditos
8275052 no hay m s delitos es que hay m s cobertura
8275053 se est n construyendo tres nuevas estaciones policiales en managua y en el caso de la capital con la apertura de un centro de emergencia policial con capacidad para atender m s llamadas y tener m s medios automotores 100 por ciento m s que el a o pasado y 200 veces m s que el anterior podemos decir que con ese leve incremento puede ser que no est n ocurriendo m s delitos sino que estamos llegando a m s lugares
8275054 se dice que las cifras negras a nivel internacional en am rica latina y no precisamente en nicaragua indican que por cada 10 denuncias 3 4 no se registran
8275055 pero en nicaragua puede que var e porque en otros pa ses se oculta informaci n por falta de confianza en las fuerzas policiales lo cual no es el caso de nicaragua donde m s del 60 por ciento de la ciudadan a conf a en la instituci n policial

8275064 there is really no perfect solution at all on how were going to handle this this is something we didnt ask for the uil just told us hey youre going to amarillo now so we have to go
8275065 it will be a significant increase on our travel budget
8275066 and its all related to the uil realignment everything is going to cost more money so we have to look at every trip closely were being as wise and frugal as we can be with our expenditures
8275067 ours is not in the millions yet but its close
8275068 lake view makes a lot of long trips as well so that makes it doubly difficult for us its doubled what we accounted for but so far we havent had to make any cuts
8275069 were a member of the uil we support the uil and under the present policy of no fewer than six teams per district in class 5a there was no other choice
8275070 the other option was to move us into el paso or the dallas fort worth area and we probably would have been in worse shape
8275071 everybody wants to blame the uil but they hold the deck and they dealt the cards
8275072 this is an awesome and competitive league and were excited to be a part of it i dont know what the uil could have done differently it is what it is well show up and try to win no matter who and where were playing
8275073 i know you are the one i wanna go through the time with
8275074 take my eyes whenever it was you left i dont see you again take my tongue whenever it was you left i dont call you again

8275084 what his strategy is to go around drumming stuff on obama his crazy quotes and hes cultivated a careful reputation for being eccentric and therefore hillary is not blamed for what he does and the result is he can go around and dump on obama and almost be like a negative greek chorus

8275116 for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations its preparations are concealed not published its mistakes are buried not headlined its dissenters are silenced not praised no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed

8275135 my character is a lovable and child like person who has been serving her mother in law for 30 years and now cannot wait until she has the reigns to command the same from her own daughter in law its a light hearted comedy very different from what you see these days its really easy to make people cry but most difficult to make them laugh
8275136 this slapstick comedy is definitely on the same lines as wagle
8275137 but of course in those days the serials were made with minimal production values today the standards have definitely improved im really excited about this serial because ive received such a good script after a very long time its a story that will make everyone smile

8275147 equipped with these awards the book has taken on a new life weve had several reviewers who passed on the chance to review it the first time around offer to review it now weve also had some paperback reprint interest and even some film interest
8275148 the fact is award stickers help to convince buyers to purchase ive seen this happen with librarians when faced with two competing titles and a limited acquisition budget the librarians will take the one that won an award any award over the title that doesnt have an award to its credit im confident that this same phenomena works for bookstore patrons browsing the shelves as well

8275188 i think twitter is a fantastic technology for enterprise purposes especially if it lets users categorize their tweets so that theyre not just a single undifferentiated stream as a number of people pointed out hashtags are a current means of accomplishing this an enterprise version of twitter would let communities of practice interest groups and other collaborations quickly and easily self organize swap thoughts and keep each other up to date id expect that these collaborations would be based primarily around topics as opposed to around people which makes the ability to categorize all the more important

8275190 after developing a good friendship from touring and hanging out it was inevitable that we would gravitate towards musical conversation rather than just conversation its very similar to my fabulous friendship relationship partnership with adrian vandenberg great pals and that translated into a very healthy and very creative relationship you dont need to be aggressively and negatively beating the shit out of each other in order to create good rock music otherwise id still be working with some assholes from my past

8275192 i left purple after the show in liverpool it was so f king embarrassing i did not want to be part of dragging purple into the mud the details of which i dont really want to go into right now because it would involve personal critiques of several of the members the circumstance was i left and was asked to keep it quiet until some of the members had decided what course to pursue but i was an emotional wreck at the end of it drugs had come in in a much more overt way and it was awful to turn around and see some of the founding members playing with their heads down out of shame i just went f k it im out of here i just couldnt do it anymore i didnt want to be part of the demise of the legacy of deep purple deep purple was an unbelievably beloved band and still is in europe

8275194 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8275195 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8275196 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8275197 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8275198 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8275233 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis in many regions and freshwater systems less able to cope with extreme weather events
8275234 more dams for hydropower contribute to even more fragmented rivers that will inhibit freshwater species food for millions adapting to climate impacts by migrating up or down river systems
8275235 there are no downsides to many of the actions we can take now
8275236 we are talking about improving river management and restoring the flood holding and drought proofing services of flood plains and wetlands all of which can be shown to have short term economic social and environmental pay offs the fact that they help climate proof our river basins now is an added benefit
8275237 restoration of the 37 sites that make up the lower danube green corridor is estimated to cost 183 million compared to damages of 396 million from the 2005 flood and likely earnings of 85 6 million per year this is adaptation to climate impacts even if it is not sold as such
8275238 our studies show that it is often a disaster that leads to the river restoration activities that will increase resilience to climate impacts
8275239 it would make more sense to avoid or reduce the impact of disaster by restoring and strengthening our river systems now
8275240 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis

8275244 is there a link between the pollution and my cancer
8275245 i dont know but the government has known about the rhones pollution for a very long time
8275246 im always careful to label my fish so customers know where its come from
8275247 water from the rhone is used to irrigate crops and even the camargue rice
8275248 im nearly 50 years old and this river has been my life now im scared of the future
8275249 for too long this campaign has fallen on deaf ears in the high streets now with clearer labelling and additional moves by some retailers to ensure the cotton bud stick stems themselves are no longer plastic we are a hopeful of a significant fall in the amount of cotton bud stick litter found but this will only happen if the consumer acts on the information
8275250 this form of pollution is so easy to stop its fantastic news that these major retailers have agreed to display the proper disposal message i am sure that people will stop using the toilet as a wet bin once they realize the problems this can cause
8275251 this is a tragedy for one of our rare native species
8275252 it highlights the importance of protecting native crayfish populations and preventing the spread of diseases between river catchments
8275253 we may never know how the signals were introduced into the afon llwyd but there are measures that people can take to help prevent crayfish plague spreading to other important white clawed crayfish sites
8275254 the environment agency is concerned about any deliberate or inadvertent introduction of this large non native crayfish which has the potential to seriously threaten the smaller native species
8275255 as the money from navigation fees is ploughed back into our waterways and facilities for boaters those who benefit from them need to contribute
8275256 we use the licensing money to improve and maintain the navigation and lock structures as well as providing facilities such as sewage disposal water points and electricity charging points boaters contributions are crucial to do so
8275257 in fairness to those boaters who do pay their license fees promptly we check boats and pursue those owners who fail to pay
8275258 boaters who think that avoiding the registration fee saves them money will pay a high price for this mistaken assumption
8275259 in the past construction professionals have been limited in their choices due to a lack of information and the cost of finding out more
8275260 together with our project partners we are thoroughly testing a range of lesser known hardwoods that may be suitable alternatives to more popular species which could become scarce if over exploited
8275261 the findings of this work will influence our own structures such as flood defences helping us find better ways of working and do more for the environment
8275262 designing and constructing structures for coasts and rivers with materials such as timber is a real challenge
8275263 this research programme commissioned by the environment agency addresses this issue head on using a combination of laboratory trials and full scale strength testing the outcomes will allow selected lesser known timbers to be used confidently in coastal and river structures
8275264 introducing lesser known timber species into the market place has always tested timber suppliers the findings from this research will not only benefit the marine construction industry but also the wider construction industry within the we recognise the importance of the current research programme it is an excellent example of multi agency collaboration with support from both the construction industry and timber suppliers

8275270 to not have access to the river or the views was a waste the bridge has brought all that into play you need to make a bold statement the bridge makes that bold statement
8275271 it was seen as part of a package of regeneration it wasnt seen entirely as a transport project
8275272 it is one view of the area that people photograph
8275273 the image of the bridge is a very striking image it is very widely used on publicity photographs and on all sorts of tourist mementoes the bridge is integral it is such a unique design it doesnt look like any other bridge
8275274 the bridge was a landmark of this area and this ancient bridge was very well known all around the world destroying a bridge was a signal of the destroying of our connections and our past to reconstruct the bridge the idea was to reconstruct our connections
8275275 once upon a time bridges were all about getting people from one side of a river to the other
8275276 generally we dont really think about when and how we use water but it is a valuable resource and as it becomes more expensive we need to act we need to make sure water companies are planning ahead but residents business developers and water companies can also help by using water more sparingly we all have to get water wise because we dont want to reach the bottom of the well

8275279 we cannot expect to develop if we disqualify half of our population women from full and equal participation in national endeavours equal rights for women are an economic social cultural and political necessity
8275280 until the disadvantages faced by women are addressed the needs of men and boys should be secondary
8275281 womens well being often cannot improve without including men because gender is relational interventions directed at women are often ineffective or unsustainable if men do not cooperate or are not involved
8275282 boys tend to undervalue education and opt for quick financial returns in the labour market

8275284 in june hudson created and launched her own line of hair care products alongside her longtime celeb stylist david babaii entitled david babaii for wildaid
8275285 the company 220 laboratories inc filed a lawsuit in los angeles superior court on monday against hudson babaii and their manufacturer universal for 17 offenses including the misappropriation of trade secrets fraud and breach of contract and confidence
8275286 we stand by our actions during the research and development process of the david babaii for wildaid hair care line and believe that 220 laboratories allegations are baseless and without any merit if we are formally served with the complaint we will vigorously defend this claim

8275321 the costs are very high and its estimated that it could cost upwards of 10 000 to send the body back to brazil but people have been very good when other tragedies happened in places like ennis and gort where the local and brazilian communities got together to raise the necessary funds
8275322 i suppose as details filtered through people didnt believe it it takes a while for something like that to sink in roscommon is a small town a small place where most of the brazilian community would know each other
8275323 we are appealing to all members of the community to contribute to this collection which will go towards bringing kezia home and also provide some support to her daughter and family back in brazil
8275324 we would also appeal to everyone to attend the special prayer service being organised to take place on tuesday evening in the square in roscommon town in memory of kezia
8275325 it is time for the people of ballaghaderreen town to take a more active hand the gas pollution from the landfill mound as it is will be with us for up to 20 years and that increase is plenty to ensure that the town is engulfed in gas on the same basis that it has engulfed lung banada lessian aughalistia etc on an ongoing basis
8275326 if this facility goes ahead and is not defeated it will be checkmate ballaghaderreen which already has a waste transfer station as well the landfill will then have more waste facilities than any other town or city in connaught and will be the major regional waste processing centre
8275327 local residents have endured enough and are entitled to an end to waste processing in their area our dump has moved from local dump to regional landfill but if this facility goes ahead our town and the lung valley hinterland runs the serious risk of becoming the stink hole sink hole of the west and frankly if we cannot raise a fight on such an issue we deserve it
8275328 we owe it to ourselves and the next generation not to be looking at some future date at what could be in our neighbourhood and thinking that if i only did something this place would be fit to live in
8275329 we are asking parents and guardians to consider including high visibility clothing bicycle helmets and other life saving road safety gear on their back to school shopping lists and make sure their kids are street wise about road safety before they go back to school
8275330 demonstrate good road safety behaviour at all times as your child will learn from your example so if your child walks or cycles to school take them on the route in advance and make sure they know where they are going if they travel by car or bus make sure they know how important it is to put their seatbelt on at all times
8275331 we had lived in england for a number of years where we never had any trouble before we decided to return to roscommon in search of a quiet life and a nice place to raise our children but then we came back to this
8275332 i have recently had to resign from my employment so that i can be here to support my family i say support as i am unable to protect my family from such attacks but there are fewer when i am present we are at the end of our tether and cant seem to get help anywhere
8275333 roscommon county council has a policy of not commenting on individual cases it should also be noted that all applications for housing transfers are assessed on merit and according to availability of units

8275342 according to karma the girls are singing the flying of the cranes composed by the fifth dalai lama who is said to have been a sometime poet a prisoner sentenced to death is enclosed in a box and thrown into the river through the slats he spies two flying cranes and implores them to lend him the help of their wings asked if they did so karma shakes his head that prisoner was probably a romantic sort he says
8275343 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
8275344 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind
8275345 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic
8275346 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
8275347 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
8275348 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying

8275355 i was really excited when i saw my first freewheelin bikes around then realized they were all over and i couldnt take a picture of each one
8275356 anaerobic digestion is extremely attractive why would we go on throwing food waste into holes in the ground when we could generate our own electricity and end up with a product that can be returned to the soil
8275357 it seems to me that a plant on this scale would fit into any industrial estate in the country while the decision has to be taken locally and in consultation with residents i am sure this is the way forward
8275358 this workshop is the first of its kind bayelsa state will be organising and it is a continuous process and we are assuring mothers of our preparedness to put in place mother and child survival interventions
8275359 you should emphasise the importance of creating awareness plans of action and strategies that would ensure gender mainstreaming in all legislation and national policies
8275360 policy makers lawmakers the media and other stakeholders should be encouraged to appreciate their roles in addressing the impact of hiv aids poverty illiteracy and all forms of discrimination
8275361 cannot be achieved without the passage of the draft bill currently before the national assembly

8275370 we went through a careful pre selection process for an overseas outsourcing partner and spent considerable time visiting short listed companies in india aabsys differentiated through their class facility easy access to nearby education talent pools high staff retention their strong financial position and years of experience providing gis data services including smallworld gis and esri expertise we also stayed away from very large 1 000 companies based on our market research as an added bonus we took comfort from aabsys partnering with mettenmeier in germany the largest smallworld gis service provider in the world and our strongest partner for several years
8275371 after the market success in australia and the us with our adjust
8275372 after meeting with the management of we do it during their assessment visit to india we have made a personal connection and feel very comfortable working together with the we do it team
8275373 there is a high degree of similarity in the products offered by different life insurance companies but hdfc standard life has successfully been able to differentiate its communication with its sar utha ke jiyo brand idea our new childrens plan communication is designed to allow customers to think of their children and their future in a natural way
8275374 whats more we want to reassure the parents that when it comes to their childrens dreams they dont need to rely on anyone else other than self to make it true thats where sar utha ke jiyo starts becoming really meaningful to the target segment
8275375 we are not selling dreams through our ad we have shown a small child aspiring for an expensive profession and subconsciously assuming that her dad may not be able to support her she instantly figures out a solution her well to do uncle the penny drops at this moment as this is capable of hurting any parents pride so we are actually shaking them up by showing a very natural day to day instance that can occur to anyone the dad in the tvc reassures his child by saying that he has actually planned for her future thus heightening the moment of self respect which the brand stands for
8275376 dit is zijn eerste seizoen op die afstand over twee jaar bereikt hij pas zijn top ik ben ervan overtuigd dat die tijd er dan wel uitkomt

8275378 there are very few test and measurement suppliers who produce instruments that can meet our exacting requirements from sata 3gbps and 6gbps and ddr timing measurements to general purpose lab measurements
8275379 we selected the tektronix products for their powerful triggering capabilities unique dpx technology large display general ease of use and the probing system which uses solder in tips and digital signal processing overall we found the tektronix offerings provide the best available signal integrity for our demanding applications
8275380 we are very pleased that izt decided to invest in our award winning high performance digital phosphor oscilloscopes to meet the exacting test and measurement requirements of their advanced telecommunications development projects
8275381 tektronix is well recognized for its expertise in signal integrity and its proven knowledge in addressing complex high speed measurements and analysis the applications being developed by izt are a classic example of areas where tektronix powerful and versatile test solutions meet customer needs

8275384 as suppliers continue to work towards overcoming supply and demand constraints changing market dynamics are forcing suppliers to change strategies to move towards offering more end to end services or hold their leadership positions
8275385 because few suppliers today have end to end s2p source to pay service capabilities they are making concerted efforts to round out their capabilities through acquisitions partnerships and internal enhancements
8275386 po suppliers are expanding their delivery footprint across onshore in region and offshore delivery locations
8275387 while sourcing focused suppliers are onshore centric and p2p focused suppliers tend to focus on offshore centric models end to end suppliers have developed a healthy mix of onshore in region and offshore ftes almost all po suppliers are beginning to optimize their location strategies as global sourcing starts to play an increasingly important role in the po market
8275388 within the worlds emerging economies such as india millions of new businesses are demanding just the technology they need at the prices they can afford from a vendor they can trust today we answer that need by introducing new products that join our existing vostro product line

8275391 researchers found that 70 of the 123 mothers experienced remission during the study period and there was a significant decrease in the number of psychiatric symptoms among children of mothers who experienced a remission of depressive symptoms

8275409 the college needs to take more drastic action than it has to date the vincentians should withdraw themselves from the governing council of the college while the investigation is ongoing
8275410 because kids out there going to average schools deserve every opportunity that kids at flash schools have and this is the way through
8275411 but i cannot understand why public institutions such as schools should not be accountable to the community that funds their salaries and running costs
8275412 right now we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving
8275413 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8275414 now after nine months mr rudd is attempting to distract attention from our declining economy and his inability to deal with it with a big address to the nation which simply imitates the coalitions agenda
8275415 well what would be revolutionary would be for someone to actually do this as opposed to just talk about it
8275416 under provisions of the ministry of education on use board of governors of government aided schools are empowered to levy extra charges as need may arise with approval from the director of education you willfully failed to strictly adhere to this policy and procedures on implementation of use by levying extra fees without approval from the director of education
8275417 you failed to appear before the secondary department disciplinary committee despite an earlier invitation by the office of the commissioner in charge of secondary education i take exception to your conduct and for that matter i have interdicted you on half pay pending further investigations
8275418 let me emphasise that our commitment to establish a tourism training centre of excellence at the coast remains resolute the facility will provide training opportunities for those who want to widen knowledge and skills to enhance productivity in the tourism sector
8275419 our marketing budget is not adequate we realise that if we are to compete with other destinations we have to invest more in marketing and promotion of tourism
8275420 it was deplorable the troops search operation they came into the school as the students were in their normal learning activities
8275421 ich steh allein in der philharmonie am fl gel auf dem podium
8275422 we need business leadership that is committed to the prosperity of uganda as a nation and that is accountable to its people
8275423 there is a challenge to us as business leaders of uganda we are expected to possess qualities and standards of our colleagues in developed countries in addition to this we are expected to be change agents in our society to be proactive to educate and empower others and to function between different cultures societies and countries
8275424 as opportunities for doing business in our country continue to grow success of uganda is hinged upon the quality of its human resource and in order to enable us to be competitive in the global market we definitely need to keep improving the quality of our local business leadership
8275425 i am happy to note that this forum has identified this need and has chosen to invest in leadership development with courses tailored to the needs of ugandan managers in a global economy
8275426 we initiate and provide programs activities conventions and publications that support and assist the development of leadership in uganda and enhance relationships between countries
8275427 graduates are the lifeblood of society and the economy of their country prevalence among students may not be the same as the general population and we hope it is lower because these are a select group of individuals
8275428 we are happy and proud of what you have given us we trust you and depend on you
8275429 i am pleased that dave has accepted an appointment to our board of directors
8275430 he has extensive experience as a director of small publicly traded companies and the expertise of investing in oil and gas properties which will benefit capital city energy group as it develops its own properties and grows through acquisition
8275431 we met the minister in his office in form of consultations and we never took any minutes because it was me the md the minister and his personal assistant
8275432 three public officials met the minister of finance somewhere without any record and approved items with monetary implications to them the decision was very informal that you committed the fund into spending huge sums of money yet you have nothing like minutes to show for that said meeting
8275433 the chairman of the board has led this into a casual matter just rushing to write a post dated letter without checking so how can we go on with such evidence mr gaamuwa is surely hiding something from us he cant run such matters casually and moreover in a public office of workers money
8275434 given the massaging of this document mr chairman we should recommend that the two step out of office so that this doctoring stops immediately
8275435 so this means that you knew the minister was going to stamp the letter since you say you never recorded it in the delivery book you surely must be hiding something mr gaamuwa and md
8275436 you surely need to prove us wrong if we say that gayaza land was meant to wash the dirty linen of the wakiso land that was bought at shs24 million
8275437 why then did you purchase land in the same locality but at a different price
8275438 i was recruited by the nssf board and went through three interviews one from the minister of finance
8275439 dominant high pressure over the area is minimizing the marine air influence
8275440 and its still early enough its still summer enough that theres still a good amount of available heating so the long days end up allowing us to heat up
8275441 parents are forcing schools to teach in holidays because they do not want children to stay at home claiming they parents are busy
8275442 they parents have resorted to taking children to study from homes where we do not have mandate to apprehend them
8275443 oh where where has my heart gone trapped in the eyes of a stranger oh i i want to go back to believing in everything and knowing nothing at all
8275444 this pace of the rupee depreciation was not expected the move will only benefit exporters who had not hedged their dollar earnings as per my assessment more than 60 per cent of exporters had hedged the rupee against the dollar in the range of 41 to 42
8275445 we had hedged at rs 38 to rs 42 to a dollar as a result we will not realise the benefits of the current exchange rate
8275446 the government and the central bank had advised exporters to adjust to the rupee rise as a result exporters went in for hedging but no one hedged at the level of the exchange rate that is seen today what one needs is a stable exchange rate to be able to negotiate export orders with foreign clients as well as take less risky hedging positions
8275447 as much as 67 per cent of our exports are to europe and the value of the euro against the rupee has been showing a decreasing trend leather exporters with earnings in dollars may be benefited by the recent depreciation over the next six months
8275448 we expected the rupee to reach 42 against the dollar by december
8275449 we also have to watch out for fertiliser imports we expect the capital account balance at 66 billion moreover overall accretion to reserves could be at 30 billion
8275450 but this was because of an increase in raw material prices the real growth in the sector would not be more than 5 6 per cent
8275451 it is the duty of the government to protect its citizens
8275452 that enable them survive and scale the challenges of life confidently
8275453 most countries have now seen that we cannot meet all the international development agenda without taking care of those who seem to be marginalised when it comes to access
8275454 the structured educational system provided by the state for children in most countries the formal education system is state supported and state operated in some countries the state allows and certifies private systems which provide a comparable education
8275455 in contrast non formal education refers to education which takes place outside of the formally organised school most typically the term or phrase non formal education is used to refer to adult literacy and continuing education for adults
8275456 evidence to date suggests that this is a mistaken assumption conversely a strong focus on adult education or literacy assumes that literate parents will insist that their children go to school and become literate there is some evidence for this assumption however parents make decisions about schooling based on various factors including economics when local regional or national economic conditions are not good parents even literate parents may resist sending their children to school when this happens the problem of literacy becomes a structural part of the country and becomes difficult to eradicate
8275457 people are likely to say they are literate when they are not the reverse is not usually the case
8275458 the ube programme was launched in september 1999 in sokoto and the non formal component launched in kuchigoro fct but adult and non formal education sector has never received any funding from ubec sources yet adult and non formal education is part of the countrys universal basic education programme and in the enabling law there is therefore a need to review disbursement formula of 2 percent consolidated fund for ubec to make adult and non formal education a beneficiary
8275459 we still dont seem to have seen the fact that we must take education holistically if we must address out development challenges because right now when you mention non formal education open distance learning some kind of opposition seem to the obvious even among the so called educationists in nigeria
8275460 every problem in nigeria can be linked to illiteracy maternal deaths
8275461 is that the countrys literacy rate is falling government must demonstrate its willingness to remedy the situation this can begin by funding the national commission adequately to make at least five million people literate year for the next 10 years if this is done then we may reduce the illiteracy rate by 50 percent by the year 2015
8275462 complicated the matter the more and the president olusegun obasanjo signed us out of receiving a kobo the reason given was that there will be a substantive budget to carry on with
8275463 it would also encourage people all over the world to invest more into the future of youths through education
8275464 her passion for educational growth and development has thus been inspired from above only and she has consistently used the weapon to shape the future of the world planting schools encouraging the establishment of new ones carefully coordinating work in the field mrs adeboye started a vigorous movement that has led to the founding of several institutions caring for the educational welfare in her country and abroad
8275465 as a parent struggling to keep my children in school i am frustrated by the way this school is imposing prohibitive charges on us
8275466 you are required to contribute sh70 000 for boarding students and sh30 000 for day students this is to enable teachers complete the syllabus on time and also help students with specific problems
8275467 you will be asked to pay whether your daughter son attended or not
8275468 in the process of organising registration and uneb exams the school incurs lots of expenses in photocopying and producing various documents as well as other administrative costs
8275469 while some may decide to mobilise collective services like taking passport size photos whose payment might be reflected as part of registration fees other schools may not
8275470 schools subscribe to different exam bodies to which they have to pay money this makes it inevitable for us to levy fees to cater for such expenses
8275471 schools which charge more than what uneb stipulates are taking advantage of the situation
8275472 for my money i dont know if it gets any better than when he sings when a man loves a woman

8275515 it was the best feeling in the world just to know she was alive
8275516 shes talking and just asking about her kids all the time and letting everybody know how much she loves them and appreciates the searching for her and not giving up she said she knew that everybody was looking for her
8275517 she had children here that she loved dearly as well as her husband and her family with the small children she had the will to carry on

8275538 we are still seeing a lot of virus around in every part of the state kids will soon be involved in after school activities during the time of day when mosquitoes are most active so we want parents and schools to remind young people to cover up and use bug spray to help prevent mosquito bites

8275551 we need to end it its very simple we just need to end it
8275552 i agree with you i have no clue where she is
8275553 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8275554 caylees out there somewhere and her rotting body is starting to decompose
8275555 i know my mom will never forgive me im never going to forgive myself because theres that chance that i may not see caylee again and i dont want to think about that
8275556 gave caylee to someone that you dont want anyone to find out because you think youre a bad mom or something happened to caylee and caylees buried somewhere or in a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it

8275562 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change

8275581 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8275582 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8275583 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8275584 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8275585 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8275586 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8275587 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8275588 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8275589 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8275590 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8275591 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

8275595 please permit me to use this opportunity to advise parents not to allow their wards attend any unapproved higher institutions of learning as all efforts particularly in finance would amount to a waste and effort in futility
8275596 it is unfortunate that unsuspecting parents have been convinced to secure admission for their wards in such schools in the state but government would not fold its hands and continue to such dubious exercise without warning the parents
8275597 even if a school is an affiliate of an approved higher institution it should be more than 200 kilometers away from the main school and the state is expected to provide and sell land to those desiring to establish such institutions
8275598 the ministry has received several applications from proprietors of secondary schools wishing to convert them to higher institutions and ministry officials would soon embark on inspections to ascertain the state of such schools
8275599 reforming energy subsidies opportunities to contribute to the climate change agenda
8275600 many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up inefficiencies in the global economy and are part of the market failure that is climate change

8275606 the examinations were wholly conducted by the turkish college officials these people neither knew the children who sat for the exams personally nor their parents they only marked the papers according to pre set academic standards and only the children who passed their papers were given admission
8275607 three of the four children of the permanent secretary of the education ministry who wrote the exams for admission into tertiary institutions were disqualified because they could not get the required marks needed for admission two children of the permanent secretarys deceased friend and former civil servant hassan audu who are now under the permanent secretarys care were also not admitted because they did not meet the entry requirement
8275608 the sons of the yobe state pdp chairman abba gana tata and that of the state npc chairman mohammed bello arabi are among 123 students who are going straight to the republic of turkey for their university education because they were able to pass their examinations well
8275609 this tells you that merit is the only criterion and nothing else
8275610 in nearly all markets citizens believe its up to ordinary people to change their behaviour the way in which global issues and personal behaviour is entwined explains the increased relevance of international news

8275613 tell this lady to get away if not i will box her on the head
8275614 i could not afford a fishing boat so i used to set my nets on foot in the chest deep waters on the shoreline
8275615 within a twinkle of an eye a crocodile grabbed my left hand and it started rapidly pulling me deeper into the water
8275616 i realised one of my hands was gone and before long the crocodile followed me and was eating the lower parts of my body which were still in the water
8275617 it took the five men who came to rescue me over half an hour to dislodge my leg from the strong jaws of the beast
8275618 i now stay alone surviving on handouts from sympathisers since i cannot manage to do any work
8275619 the crocodile grabbed my stomach and sunk me deep into the water where i could not breathe but after a struggle i worked my way up to the surface to get some air but it again overpowered me and we both sunk
8275620 rescuers turned up in a boat after a while but the crocodile went away with a big chunk of flesh from my stomach
8275621 i am in constant pain and cannot even walk fast or do any strenuous work yet i have a family to cater for
8275622 i appeal to any sympathiser out there to come to my rescue so that i can get properly cured
8275623 in most cases victims to the crocodiles are devoured wholesomely leaving no piece of the remains to be recovered by relatives
8275624 malongo residents live not only in danger of the crocodiles but are also faced with the nuisance of hippos and the wild pigs that indiscriminately destroy crops every season unbothered by district authorities

8275627 nothing demonstrates the need for on the go entertainment like air travel the availability of our myvu line through airport wireless and techshowcase is a strategic extension to our brand and for our retail distribution

8275641 l encore la relation de confiance restaur e avec lautre partenaire de la paix isra l comme avec les etats unis a jou un r le majeur cest aussi parce que la syrie sait que nous avons d sormais les meilleurs rapports avec ces deux pays que damas a voulu voir la france assumer le moment venu cette responsabilit sans pr c dent

8275646 there are more than 1001 problems facing this country they should devote their energies to solving these problems instead of dabbling into peoples private lives even if you subscribe to multichoice you have a right not to tune to the channel airing it why must anyone put a blanket ban on it
8275647 why didnt they ban television in its entirety because they too show some movies which might be considered immoral
8275648 we will never be able to do this where will sa and zimbabwe get that kind of money

8275655 this will show the pessimists that we are in effective control of the biafran land which the nigerian government calls the south east
8275656 more than 1 000 massob members are languishing in various prisons in nigeria
8275657 the massacre continued in january and july 1966 in most parts of the north and indeed western nigeria
8275658 there has been no end to the genocide against the igbo ethnic group
8275659 as safety of lives and property of ndigbo could not be guaranteed in nigeria
8275660 no one wants to be on the streets at night it just is not safe neighbours will pretend they dont hear knocking and pleas to borrow their car if it had been any later i would have just had to stay at home and wait until morning
8275661 since we moved to this site i have seen a large drop off in those coming to the maternity ward we have not had any reports of the military stopping people from seeking services at the hospital but people cannot get past the psychological barrier of seeking care so close to the base
8275662 because of the insecurity unfpa does not have access to patients in the mountains centre of sporadic attacks we must send everything through the government we cant follow up and must trust that it is getting to the women and they are using the kits correctly
8275663 this is in spite of the sustained sensitisation campaigns embarked upon by the state government
8275664 in their desperation to derail the peace process and bring down the good reputation of the jtf militants have again engaged the men of the task force in an unprovoked encounter in its location at torugbne lobia an spdc location
8275665 the militants who were four in a speedboat started firing sporadically at our men when they sighted out boat conveying some new soldiers to bomadi which the militants attacked recently
8275666 therefore as professionals we are mindful of the fact that we are not at war with them our troops fired warning shots into the air to scare them but they kept firing hence we acted in self defence
8275667 two of the militants jumped into the river and the remaining two abandoned the speedboat and ran into the jungle subsequently the speedboat was recovered
8275668 the commander of the jtf brigadier wuyep rimtip wondered why the unwarranted attack on our men who are just carrying out their assigned duties and warned that henceforth anybody that attacks us we shall carry our a reprisal attack and follow it to a logical conclusion
8275669 we in the jtf are law abiding citizens like any nigerian taking due process rule of law and applying minimum force on self defence where necessary
8275670 the commander and the entire jtf would not succumb to blackmail intimidation or threat of any kind in discharging our statutory duties in the maintenance of law and order
8275671 as it is now law abiding citizens can no longer travel in the waterways for fear being killed by the soldiers paid to protect us ironically there is a militant camp not too far from the military base and they have never confronted the militants
8275672 the government deemed it fit to review all mining arrangements with the aim of improving them so as to serve the best interests of the country and its people and also to avoid confrontations between corporate mining entities and local communities incidents which have resulted in unrest and loss of lives in the past
8275673 the government has as its primary interest the people especially the host mining communities
8275674 it is not just about setting up a selected task force that does not take into account the concerns of organisations monitoring the extractive industry as well as the views of the affected communities
8275675 a lot of factors touching on the interests of land owners the adequate payment of royalties lease agreements corporate social responsibility and a host of others have to be taken into consideration
8275676 the task force must review and make public all mining contracts ensure environmental protection is treated seriously and involve communities and civil society in all matters relating to mining
8275677 no political or other undue pressure or interference is exerted on members of the task force whether by government officials or mining companies
8275678 i hire a caterpillar machine for 1000 for eight hours to open up mining sites and have to care for dozens of my miners and their relatives so any adjustment in the laws that are unfavourable to us miners would simply discourage me it is not that one always finds diamonds sometimes i run at massive loss
8275679 before the 11 year long civil war fought between 1991 and 2002 we had more than 14 exporters now there are less than six so this tells you how the business is going any more taxes or conditionalities put on the way of exporters may well be too much and discouraging
8275680 the relations between iran and nigeria had tremendous potentials and opportunities for mutual benefit in several areas such as oil and gas development and renewable sources of energy
8275681 other areas include nuclear energy for peaceful uses human capital development and training in handicrafts and carpet weaving including skills acquisition for small scale enterprises and agro allied industries
8275682 this meeting should adopt imaginative and constructive strategies and indeed an action plan for the speedy implementation of decisions taken at the two previous sessions of the commission including those that will be taken at the end of the current session
8275683 areas like the bilateral air services agreement needed to be straightened out to improve the development of air transport between the two countries
8275684 there would be need to finalise already pending agreements rather than creating new ones
8275685 we have set targets for achieving this ambition within the stated time frame and this include energy saving programme for the country
8275686 please appeal to government on our behalf to ensure that kerosene is supplied to every filling station in abuja and to also ensure that the subsidised price for which the nnpc sells their product is maintained in all the stations i am tired of spending nights at fuel stations or even risking my life to come here by 3 am when i am supposed to be resting in my bed
8275687 you wont believe that i have been waiting for the past three hours and theres no sign that anybody will be attended to except the black marketers and touts that give them money i can boldly say it anywhere that what is happening here is a syndicate or better still an organised network of crime between the station attendants blackmarketers and even the so called task force
8275688 the arrangement was that the task force would pick 10 jericans each from the lines orderly arranged ie from the various segments but the reverse had been the case
8275689 i buy this product to continue my business but these forcemen will not let my dream come true
8275690 military men no longer report at their beat as they have turned nnpc filling station and all ap station to their offices and homes they have suddenly become kerosene dealers as some no longer see the need to go to work i know too well that they cannot resist the taste of money but they should stop coming here to flog married pregnant women as well as peoples children who refuse to comply with their demands
8275691 these people always use delay tactics with one excuse or the other to deceive us
8275692 i lost my dad when i was in primary school but survived the perils of this life through my mothers trade which is kerosene retailing but has resigned due to her poor health condition leaving the trade to us for survival
8275693 as a child with vision and positive expectations i decided not to be idle or become a liability to the society and so decided to continue in the inherited trade which has been of immense help to us but here i am in the civil service line even with my late fathers i d card with no hope of getting the product
8275694 rich also cry if not now it will certainly be some day yes some day
8275695 i so pity some young teenagers who allowed themselves to be fondled by these dirty touts and useless policemen wondering to get kerosene expressing disappointment with a shrug of the shoulder may god help us
8275696 they refused to follow government instruction to sale the product at n50 per litre at ap even if 10 tankers discharge kerosene before you know it the product is finished
8275697 our operation ends in the compound so anything outside the demarcation line is not our business the attendant blamed everything on the task force who collects bribes and then pick people from illegal line to be attended to
8275698 we are fed up with these touts who are always ready to beat you mercilessly if you fail to comply with them

8275714 youre so vain you probably think this convention is about you
8275715 i know i said that i didnt believe senator obama had the experience but i was wrong i know senator obama has the experience and the only thing john mccain seems to have experience with is following lockstep behind president bush
8275716 i have a lifetime of experience john mccain has a lifetime of experience and barack obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8275717 no one is really ready to be commander and chief

8275730 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
8275731 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
8275732 we just got news of another genocide on our people by the joint task force jtf again in bayelsa a few weeks after the burning of agge
8275733 this jtf to my mind is one whose primary responsibility is to kill innocent citizens and then proffer explanation i think the time has come for the probing of the activities of the jtf in the niger delta
8275734 the jtf has done more damage to innocent communities and citizens as an occupying force than the so called millitants they are suppose to combat
8275735 i lived in us for 14 years i am a green card holder and know the law we are just mobilizing people who are eligible voters to go out and register and vote for him and i dont know why this should be an issue
8275736 nobody was forced to attend the event i have paid n10m for a table at a concert nobody was forced to pay the event was a private thing and i used my own money to put it together some people like to sit in front of the television and watch history in the making but we chose to mobilise people to vote for someone we believe in
8275737 the whole thing is politics some people who have one thing or the other against the dg are using the opportunity provided by this controversy to level scores unfortunately some newspapers or the media have been deceived into fighting the woman
8275738 i have analysed the whole thing and it is clear that the woman has not contravened any law that is why i laugh at some people who are calling for her resignation
8275739 i have traveled to about seven countries in the last couple of months and i know the kind of sentiments people express on obamas aspiration somebody in london gave me a lunch just because of obama there are people who are raising funds in their countries to help push his campaign they are running commercials and advertisements in their local media americans are accessing the messages via internet
8275740 i dont know if these security men have been sleeping on duty
8275741 despite efforts being made to minimize the problems in the clearance of goods the expected results will not be achieved if shippers do not do the right thing
8275742 we have done our best to entrench a lasting democracy in our country in accordance with the principle of rule of law though we accept that there are a lot of rooms for improvement we can achieve much more if the political class gives us the chance to operate
8275743 apply restraint because it is better to slow down and get it right than to rush and spoil things it is better to slow and sharpen the knife and then move on it does not always pay to be fast
8275744 some of the mobile operators have begun offering services on the 3g platform and subscribers are now able to transmit data across huge wireless bandwidths
8275745 we believe that with the current penetration of phone services across the country broadband services would be a major catalyst for pervasive application of e education e health e commerce e government e business and all those e applications that are available in most developed countries of the world
8275746 this also means that if broadband infrastructures are made available to users there will be cost effective use of internet services as users would spend less time doing their businesses on the net
8275747 the rationale behind the sabi project is to provide wireless broadband services in nigerian cities so as to stimulate demand for internet services and increase usage and most importantly this project is to drive broadband to home at affordable levels
8275748 the idea behind the win project is to provide a national backbone infrastructure which will allow multiple operators to hook on at any point to deliver quality broadband transmission services across the country
8275749 on friday august 22 2008 at about 11 45am chief oboko bello took off aboard a delta airline flight at the murtala mohammed international airport lagos nigeria to the united states on the invitation of the university of rhode island usa and arrived atlanta us at about 1300hrs on 23 august 2008
8275750 chief oboko bello president of the federated niger delta ijaw communities fndic among 22 youth leaders of the niger delta were bound to the united states of america with the support of chevron texaco nigeria ltd

8275754 its been a long process but we are there we had to wait for the international telecommunications union to agree on the different frequencies in the different regions before we could start the migration process
8275755 that must have necessitated the sale to jimoh ibrahim who had wanted to expand his business empire to include an investment in the media
8275756 i urge the organisers of this festival and those who will be presenting their works to highlight kampala city as we have achieved lots of success in sports

8275758 i wonder why they have not looked at working with such a willing partner
8275759 i can tell you the deal is a permanent one we are not speaking about a loan
8275760 the club can announce that we have reached agreement for the permanent transfer of young pyo lee to borussia dortmund
8275761 the south korean international full back played 93 times for us following his move from psv eindhoven in august 2005 we wish young pyo well for the future
8275762 i would think he wont go to ireland we will look to the champion stakes at newmarket
8275763 he ran a super race on saturday and hes fine
8275764 he doesnt want to join either of them city or everton and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8275765 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8275766 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8275767 fernando and myself managed to link up quite a few times against middlesbrough on saturday so there are definitely a few signs there that the partnership is developing
8275768 it would obviously have been nicer if one of us would have scored but it doesnt really matter who gets the goals as long as someone does and the results follow thats the most important thing
8275769 we know what a big game this is but then every game is a must win when you are at a club like liverpool
8275770 we want to go one further than last year and were confident we can do it
8275771 they were the better team on the night two weeks ago and you have to give them credit
8275772 it was a massive wake up call that they cant be underestimated they have some big physical boys who can also play a bit
8275773 we need to make sure we improve from saturday and see that were on it if not well come unstuck
8275774 its a massive game and we need to play very well but we know were at home and were at a better level than two weeks ago so were very confident well win the game
8275775 it was a disastrous result for us really but fair play to northampton because they came here set their stall out and made it difficult for us
8275776 the referee has sent off gary cahill and i dont want to start having a go at him but it was a bit harsh because gary was committed to the challenge and wasnt going for the man
8275777 weve spoke after the game and we cant be happy with that performance we know as players that we have let ourselves down as well as the gaffer the staff and the fans
8275778 this was a massive chance for us to go on and do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe through this route but it wasnt to be and now its all our attention to the league because thats all we have got until the end of december
8275779 now its down to us to make sure we stay up with the big boys and keep in the top eight from now until that time
8275780 this week ill be at monza for a test day on friday 29th
8275781 next week well go to spa i love this track id like to race there all the year round its the best of the all the track and i hope that ill have a car that works the way i want
8275782 ill give it all to win again if someone has doubts as far as my motivation is concerned go ahead i want to win more than ever
8275783 it must be ingrained into young males heads early that there should be a nationwide moratorium on
8275784 my own personal opinion is that contacting elected officials will do nothing at
8275785 i wont pretend to fathom the psychology of a man who was severely abused by his older sister and
8275786 they didnt tell me anything about it as a first time horse owner i trusted the vet to tell me if there was going to be any implications or could be
8275787 if i had known to ask what are the reactions i would have never had them give her the shots i would have given her something else or just dealt with it
8275788 any patient should be empowered to ask the questions its very common for people to be intimidated in the human world when theyre being treated and not to ask the specific questions about their own medical conditions
8275789 it needs to be better on the veterinarians end as well as in eliciting questions and comments
8275790 n o a primeira vez que identificamos esses c digos n o uma ocorr ncia rara mas tamb m n o foi a primeira vez
8275791 his lying about his heritage his being tied to a racist church for 25 years his unpatriotic smears against the flag and the national anthem
8275792 hillary supporters are smart enough to know that one more right wing nut job on the supreme court and they can kiss roe v wade goodbye
8275793 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8275794 hmm who should women vote for the man who left his injured wife for a woman half his age and then went on to denigrate that second wife by calling her a c t and suggesting she participate in a topless beauty contest or the man who obviously loves his wife and daughters and reveres the mother and grandmother who raised him
8275795 for those that believe all the lies about obama are you an older white person if so maybe you should wonder if you are racist
8275796 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8275797 its hard to imagine that the new york senator could have done much more for her colleague from illinois than she did tonight
8275798 i believe there are weapons of mass destruction in iraq
8275799 for those that believe all the lies about obama are you an older white person if so maybe you should wonder if you are racist

8275817 obama wrote into the night last weekend in a hotel room 15 minutes from his chicago home
8275818 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling

8275829 speaking to developers in late 2006 about making web 2 0 inspired games a key theme at develop in brighton in 2007 we were met with polite bemusement
8275830 the next 12 months saw media molecules littlebigplanet wow e3 gdc go big on web 2
8275831 now everyone gets it to the extent that web 2 0 is a hackneyed faintly embarrassing phrase and facebook no more exciting than hotmail yet were still not seeing the push from the industry id expect given the proven power of network effects and ugc to engage gamers as is being amply demonstrated by spore
8275832 i get the impression that production at western particularly american developers is ahead of those in japan
8275833 but i think that more and more in japan the process of making video game music is becoming specialised more and more japanese production companies are working together with foreign companies and sound production quality in japan is approaching that of the west

8275861 the rate of migrating pastoralist in search of water is reaching the highest occasioning a battle like competition for basic resources
8275862 we are receiving the largest number of pastoralists from mandera because the drought there is much worse
8275863 were concerned of emerging conflict because the grass we have is depleting we have planned a meeting so that pastoralists can share the resources without conflict
8275864 to come back home to the reception ive received its almost overwhelming it has been incredible

8275903 ive always believed that nobody greater impacts nfl games than the quarterback
8275904 he gets a lot of attention and blame as he should but not enough of that considers that if the other 10 people around him dont do what they are supposed to do it is the quarterback who is most adversely affected
8275905 now where quarterback issues really come into play is when you have practiced all week for a certain way the game will be played and practiced what to expect from a defense and you get in the game and they are giving you totally different looks now what very few quarterbacks in the league only a handful can adjust adapt and execute an on the fly game plan so how does a coach protect himself and his team he has the quarterback simply manage the offense
8275906 a lot of great things happened for us late on offense in that game but youd have to say that we dont have a chance in the fourth quarter if we hadnt taken a team that had a prolific scoring offense and kept them from lighting up the board
8275907 you can talk about stats and all the other stuff but in the end it was all about keeping new england to 14 points that gave us a chance
8275908 new england couldnt get the ball off receivers were open on some plays it didnt matter every defense has players who are gifted some have players who are smart this one has a lot who have both traits
8275909 nobody ive played for has had a defense like this that is ever evolving that takes you on a journey
8275910 one door of it opens to another door of possibilities it has variety in blitzes and variety in everything it does its a press its a zone blitz its a man attack with all principles in one its like a germ that spreads it can be what we want it to be we can take it again to a great place
8275911 it is a defense that relies on technique much like the entire game of football relies on it
8275912 if your technique is right you can play defense in this league for a long time
8275913 we are crisper now than we were at this time last year
8275914 were in the second year with our defensive coaches and with this system but this years giants defense is really up in the air everybody is speculating right now for many of our young guys this is their time i dont know how good we are going to be or what we are going to do but i know we wont be sitting back in trying to find out well be on the attack
8275915 weve had a lot of teams in the past that were not very sexy on offense and you can find those now in this league
8275916 but the giants have always put a premium on defense now we held the ball on offense for 10 minutes on the opening drive in the super bowl against the patriots that was at least two offensive possessions for them that they didnt get if that had not happened who knows what would have happened it did though and our defense throughout the game dictated the game thats what it takes to win that last game
8275917 our countries have similar challenges having the same policy for gms will help improve our farming as well as fight household famine and poverty
8275918 we share borders if other countries like kenya legalise biotech products by all means such products will cross to uganda how will uganda stop entry of these products into the country minus a law
8275919 farmers in nakasongola have benefited from this technology we can now grow vegetables all year round
8275920 we believe that we should work closely with government without food production there is no nation and as cfi looking ahead we want to deepen our roots in the farming sector
8275921 we want to put in more resources towards that with the support of government
8275922 we are also looking at creating regional hubs of operation we are investors in the new beira grain terminal which we believe will be a cheaper transit route
8275923 if barack obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his family first
8275924 i do not live on less than a dollar a month life is good i live with my cousin and niece in our family house in huruma
8275925 when the journalists come here they do not want even the neighbours to be near and if they find other journalists they take him away to a posh hotel and return him later
8275926 hawa wanataka kuchafua jina la obama na wanampatia maji ndio waone kama atawapa stori mbaya these white guys want to defame obama and they might have given him alcohol to see if they can get a nasty story
8275927 the media come here i give them a story and when they leave they write wrong things i never said i live on less than a dollar a day i go to college and im all right
8275928 we are moving from parish to parish carrying out the vaccination exercise starting with the areas worst hit
8275929 our administration is busy trying to help stop thirst for traveling families nomads
8275930 we are staffing it like we are going to do for the opening concert
8275931 we are going to use the opportunity as a dry run for the first big event
8275932 it is going to be a learning experience for everybody
8275933 citizens should know that someone will be there before after and during all big downtown events
8275934 we are trying to make sure that people are secure and comfortable with that and so we kind of expanded our focus not just around the arena but within that 10 minute walk and then even outside of that area
8275935 we are going to make sure that there are officers around in much greater concentration during the events than we are on just a regular patrol basis
8275936 so that is something we wont have to do which is good
8275937 that way tpd folks can just focus on being a presence and taking any enforcement action that needs to be taken and making sure it is as safe as possible as people walk to and from the arena
8275938 the main benefit between the segway and a bike i think is the energy that is not expended getting from point a to point b
8275939 they are also a great conversation tool which will really help with our interaction with the public downtown
8275940 we will first attend to school feeding programmes then give priority to vulnerable groups that include orphans and the disabled
8275941 he arab businessman flew out of bossaso with government officials present
8275942 moments later we heard a press conference held by the minister of commerce saying he arab businessman was deported

8275944 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
8275945 der grund f r das verhalten von o2 ist klar sie wollen ihre kunden zwingen teure auslandstelefonate zu f hren statt unseren service zu verwenden
8275946 die blockaden zeigen dass die traditionellen netzbetreiber rebtel als wachsende bedrohung ansehen
8275947 durch aktionen im gesetzlichen graubereich und die kraft ihrer oligopole versuchen sie uns zum aufgeben zu zwingen und die rechnungen ihrer kunden hoch zu halten
8275948 you wouldnt believe it and thats what it is now
8275949 but its a good situation they did a good job of organizing the new stadium for us for students transportation will be easy because well have buses to take them up there therell be a student parking lot also so everything we want as far as getting the students there will be better than what we had before
8275950 we really didnt want to move in the end we had to
8275951 we have a wonderful opportunity and future ahead of us we want to do the best for our players and for our fans so were taking a giant step
8275952 for our whole team its going to be a totally different environment than what theyre used to
8275953 this is just going to be a completely different experience everyone will be amped up for it
8275954 ich glaube die diskussion ber sinkende zinsen in europa ist verfr ht
8275955 es kann nichts von vornherein ausgeschlossen werden alles kann passieren
8275956 wenn die zentralbank entscheiden w rde die wirtschaft ber niedrigere zinsen zu stimulieren w rde das eine steigende inflation nach sich ziehen
8275957 manche indikatoren legen nahe dass wir den tiefpunkt des r ckgangs erreicht haben k nnten
8275958 andere deuten an dass es in einigen sektoren noch nicht soweit ist
8275959 ich glaube nicht dass die inflation notwendigerweise nachl sst nur weil sich das wachstum abschw cht
8275960 inflation bleibt die sorge nummer eins f r die zentralbanker im euro raum
8275961 wir haben immer gesagt dass wir nichts gegen einen ausl ndischen k ufer haben es kommt aber immer darauf an welches gesch ftsmodell dahinter steht

8275964 if you want to play in the big league this is what youve got to do
8275965 some companies may moan that the tender application process takes time but tell me they havent got a much more sustainable and better running business on the back of it
8275966 we can make a noise about the strict requirements but theyre not going to go away
8275967 its important to educate yourself and seek out advice on how you can go about winning contracts for the games and other events
8275968 make sure youve got sufficient suppliers staff and finance in place
8275969 its vitally important to ensure you can cope with the cashflow issues involved with not being paid for contracts until youve fulfilled them
8275970 we found out about the contract through word of mouth because were in the industry and linked to the people who make the gates
8275971 there was lots of people involved but we didnt have to go through the formal tender application process
8275972 keep your eye on the press or government websites for details of secured contracts
8275973 most large projects are broken down into lots of smaller projects so get on the phone and talk to the big contractors
8275974 were currently pursuing getting involved through companies like serco which are traditionally very good at exploiting government contracts
8275975 theyve got whole teams that are geared up to do just that and know the right people

8275979 local government has become so far removed from the lives of people to a point where some chief executives of local government councils no longer reside in the domain they were elected to administer
8275980 if we fail at this foundational level we would have failed at all levels because the local councils contain nearly nigerias entire rural majority
8275981 corruption is an activity it is also a mindset sustained by ideas that are largely false and misleading the best way to fight an idea is with another idea
8275982 a case in point was the cancelled out of lagos klm flight of june 6 2008 involving 301 passengers which upon cpu intervention got the airline to provide for two nights hotel accommodation 300 compensation was paid to each passenger as they were being checked in the total compensation in cash paid was 90 300 apart from the accommodation bills the captain of the relief flight was also made to apologise to the delayed passengers
8275983 we do seriously need to go through a lot of things because weve been on the ropes since p1
8275984 i am sure we will dig our lot on monday tuesday and wednesday but unfortunately the knock out hits have already been served
8275985 whatever way we skin the cat here we didnt start well and we didnt finish well
8275986 this is a vicious industry and when you get nailed you can get nailed pretty quick
8275987 we are in that situation we have a bit of a hole in the boat at the moment
8275988 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself
8275989 se solo fosse vero spiegherei le ali e spiccherei il volo ma ho paura paura di cadere e anche se non cadessi potrebbe venire qualcuno ad abbattermi

8275998 patients with diverticular disease are frequently advised to avoid eating nuts corn popcorn and seeds to reduce the risk of complications however there is little evidence to support this recommendation
8275999 about a third of americans will develop small pouches of the colon a condition known as diverticulosis by the time they reach age 60 two thirds have the pouches by age 85
8276000 it is not exactly clear where this idea came from because there are no studies showing this to be the case it just became a part of medical lore
8276001 in general you are happy with the overall experience you have encountered with the promise team

8276003 the project will involve the documentation of all of the thousands of dead sea scrolls fragments belonging to about 900 manuscripts and placing them in an internet databank that will be available to the public
8276004 scores of scroll fragments that were blackened or ostensibly erased over the years and which were not visible to the naked eye until now
8276005 i believe that by using spectral photography we will succeed through non invasive means to determine the amount of water present in the parchment from which the scrolls are made
8276006 data such as this has added value for conservation and preservation issues if for example we discover that the parchments are too dry it will be necessary to modify the conditions in which they are maintained
8276007 both you and a poor person might consume rice every day but you would consume a much higher quality of rice than a poor person who would eat coarse rice
8276008 the report shows that if you have a 10 percent increase in say cereal prices the number of poor would go up by 36 million almost immediately if on the other hand food prices went up this is going from cereals to food it would increase by about 85 million people

8276015 we cannot afford to tarnish the image of the diamond industry of namibia
8276016 the minister of mines nghimtima is yet to help me remove the people who are still mining on toscanini without my approval
8276017 i have raised the matter to the highest office and i am yet to get any reply and my work permit has been rejected two times while i have got my investment in namibia
8276018 certain interests in diamond mines and operations in africa held through pure africa mining ltd and other affiliates in which wextrust has a substantial interest
8276019 wextrust borrowed about a month ago 750 000 from skelton coast in africa now we needed it so we took back 250 000 we sic are still owed 450 000 and i will continue to take it out until it is paid
8276020 the reason why it is more important to pay back africa is because our only hope of getting out of our mess is africa
8276021 they have a great football team its not specific to any division they have a good football team
8276022 if an ad had seven home games he had met his budget

8276028 he became a hero for my linemen when they heard he eats 8 000 10 000 calories a day
8276029 i asked them do you understand how much he works out if he puts away 10 000 calories a day
8276030 they say he didnt want to lose a race even in practice
8276031 was everybody else was breathing hard he just won the race and he looked like im ready to go again his conditioning was amazing
8276032 i think hes going to have some other things in his plans
8276033 with young guys you do a lot of teaching a lot of drill instruction fundamental work
8276034 tackle phil loadholt played in junior college last year was his first year of playing big time football hell be more confident for being in this environment the rest of these guys have been around here for four years it gives you some confidence they see things they see things coming they know what to look for
8276035 if we just spread people out and let the quarterback drop back and throw like the pros you could play a consistent defense but now youve got teams with two split receivers with runners and with quarterbacks who can run the option as well as throw this simply generates more offense than any defense can handle

8276046 if bradman could come back today and see what s happening in the game of cricket i think he d be terribly disappointed
8276047 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well that s the way they do things these days
8276048 he dominated cricket for 20 years from his debut in 1928 to his retirement 60 years ago this month and if he had not lost eight years of his career to world war ii his figures would no doubt be better still at every olympics plenty of records are broken bradman remains unassailable
8276049 as a team we do try and score at least 300 runs a day in test cricket
8276050 in honour of bradman s legacy that s the least we can do
8276051 two dogs will be thrown literally into the trunk of a car like this
8276052 the trunk is closed and the operators either drive around for a set period of time or just leave them in there with the trunk closed
8276053 and after a certain time open the trunk and the best man left is standing and its a bloody mess in there and thats how they declare a winner
8276054 i know some guys may have put some dogs in a trunk they fought and then the next thing you know they turned the music up real loud for about 15 minutes maybe 30 minutes
8276055 and then you open up the trunk one of the dogs might be dead the other one might be mangled up
8276056 the popular initiative against the construction of minarets has been submitted in accordance with the applicable regulations but infringes guaranteed international human rights and contradicts the core values of the swiss federal constitution
8276057 such a ban would endanger peace between religions and would not help to prevent the spread of fundamentalist islamic beliefs
8276058 a couple of days ago just a handful of districts were affected and today there are 15 which are under water
8276059 the government is asking us to escape but we have nowhere to go
8276060 i remember the many projects that the us launched when i was minister of health i wish that the new president will not stop implementing them
8276061 he is a world leader making a difference in america
8276062 we need to ensure that our politics is issue oriented and mature american politicians had total loyalty to their parties unlike in kenya where politicians defect to other parties on the eve of an election to ensure they are voted in
8276063 everything has become more expensive now including pizza for people who need to watch what they spend
8276064 in naples and elsewhere in italy that should be enough to cover costs and give a profit margin without damaging quality
8276065 the german government proved to us that they remain intransigent when it comes to fair play with regard to atrocities which they committed during the war of 1904 to 1907 and the subsequent suffering of our people therefore our government should take the necessary steps to make sure that our nationals are accorded rest in their motherland and should not be paraded in museums
8276066 we respect the fact that the matter is in the hands of the two parliaments but the process towards meaningful and serious dialogue is still remote therefore we cannot sit idle but will continue to sensitise and remind both governments of this unfinished business
8276067 whatever the outcome of the research on the skulls that research must be already done by now and must only be collecting dust somewhere in germany we want those skulls back they do not belong to germany
8276068 whenever funds are raised the source of the fund has to be verified it has to be made public how much is raised you have to know who is donating what and the integrity of the donors and perhaps the party and the candidate owe a duty to explain how the money is spent
8276069 i think it is necessary for women to organise themselves and put pressure on the men when they go out to campaign they should not only dwell on issues that concern women but general issues
8276070 lest we find ourselves putting the cart before the horse which could only spawn other problems
8276071 salaries which are set by the government have become too high
8276072 companies dont explicitly tell the irs that an amendment is intended to shift supplemental executive benefits obligations into the regular pension plan

8276080 i expect donhodzo to become a hit song more like or even better than ndinzverei from my previous album
8276081 the time will come when god will show his mercy upon us and that is what i sing about in donhodzo famba zvakanaka is a sad song it shows that the album is about sadness and happiness unlike last time when i concentrated more on hardships faced by people but now i have decided to mix the themes
8276082 i expect to open my own studio soon and from there on i will be marketing all of my forthcoming albums on my own
8276083 after investigations the conclusion we reached is that these guns were stolen from policemen who have been the victims of criminal attacks
8276084 a hungry man cannot be stopped by diplomacy if he wants to vent his frustrations people do not eat diplomacy they want back what is rightfully theirs
8276085 wealth was acquired at the barrel of a gun in this country by german colonial forces at that time something which unfortunately still has a bearing on the means and ways of life for most namibians today we call on the german government to read the mood and act now as they are sitting on a time bomb
8276086 we should guard against jealousy and disunity as the enemy will be standing aside laughing at us while taking on each other for selfish gains this country belongs to all of us therefore we should try to live in peace with one another
8276087 the church has been caught up in the destructive ethnic social and economic divisions and conflicts in the nation
8276088 we therefore own up to our sins of among others taking partisan positions on national issues elevating our ethnic identities above our christian identity direct involvement in party politics and participation in post election violence which are made more ominous by the deteriorating national values sinful political strategies and failure to faithfully stand for biblical values and principles
8276089 we ask god to forgive us and to renew and empower our witness to his grace
8276090 the two top shots in the nddc told us img that the commission does not have the monopoly of ideas and suggestions are necessary from patriotic groups like img to make the commission work easier nddc told us that some of the repentant militants need relocation out of the country for non violence training because of their level of involvement and the managing director even promised to pay a visit to img and other stakeholders to explain certain policies the way the niger delta master plan was displayed which made the people accept the master plan without any problem
8276091 one of the soldiers hit three bullets on the little boys head where suddenly died
8276092 shelling the community creeks and surrounding areas of degema with their gunboats causing deaths confusion and general anarchy in the local government area
8276093 the present crop of the armed forces as represented by the jtf are morally professionally and religiously sound therefore i doubt that they jtf would degenerate to the level of fighting innocent people that they are supposed by law to protect we have not received such report before and that is the position of the force
8276094 to express our deep concern in respect of the recent spate of indiscriminate shootings and killings by men of the jtf and particularly the nigerian navy that patrol the water ways the shooting which oftentimes involve heavy artillery have added to the woes of an already traumatized local populace who have been trying to recover from the recent cult related violence that engulfed a large part of the council the panic and confusion stemming from the action of the navy has resulted in people painfully leaving their communities to places they consider safer but not without its attendant economic and psychological consequences apart from the dislocation of normal lives in the communities what is more worrisome is the fact that most of the people who dwell in these places are either children or the aged and sickly who are frequently exposed to high decibel artillery fire
8276095 convirti ndose en uno de los hallazgos m s importantes de europa

8276097 the chance of getting into a top business school is 10 to 15
8276098 if you make good choices during the application process you can up it to 80
8276099 candidates are trying to get into the head of admissions people and tell stories they think we want to hear
8276100 if someone says they are were not getting an accurate version of them its ok to talk about failure but you need to discuss what you learned from it how did you become stronger for it
8276101 look for someone who knows the application process and who knows you well
8276102 mom and dad know you well but they dont know what business schools are looking for
8276103 a lot of schools say its the most important part of the package
8276104 nigeria is obviously a very important country in africa it has a growing economy a large population and a democracy with some bumps on the way senator obama has spoken of the importance of africa in terms of the growing world economy the importance of trade african labour and failed states of which nigeria is not

8276106 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
8276107 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8276108 i come here as a wife who loves her husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
8276109 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he has this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8276110 and barack and i were raised with so many values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them

8276138 obamas relationship with ayers is an especially vivid milepost on his rise in record time from a local official who unabashedly reflected a very liberal district to the leader of national movement based largely on the claim that he can transcend ideological divides

8276143 this is a generation that doesnt look at race first but policy first
8276144 its not looking at party first but the best idea first
8276145 they are faking addresses and sneaking their children into schools
8276146 it seems to indicate that they are concerned about the state of evidence they seem anxious not to have further damaging evidence put before the tribunal
8276147 you have got a lot of talented people with ideas with money and the issue is bringing people together i expect that now with the plan and presentation by the government and others you would be able to attract more money people coming in to do projects in the power sector
8276148 expertise gained from our quebec shale play has allowed us to re evaluate our past results
8276149 we believe we have been able to correlate the results to particular shale qualities which greatly encourage us that a predictive model can be d the very high gas in place numbers and promising production results from our two wells in the liard shale s make this test very interesting
8276150 we also see the value in the continuation of the development of the upper shales which have produced strongly over the past two years and believe this work program will highlight the shale commerciality in the liard basin
8276151 i think it really helps us re imagine our city streets as places of safe non auto physical activity
8276152 from an environmental perspective its time we re imagine our space and our streets and to make streets accessible to everyone

8276161 the same way the american electorate reacted to jfks roman catholic background was the same way that they reacting to the race that obama comes from
8276162 the main issue before the convention was about ethnicism race but now attention has shifted to the iraq war the spiralling economy mortgage abortion oil nuclear power and off drilling on the iraq war obama promises to end the war and bring the soldiers home while mccain wants a more constructive withdrawal on mortgage obama is calling on government intervention to cushion the effects of the spiralling economy while mccain believes that the borrowers were irresponsible and should be allowed to bear the brunt of the actions on abortion obama believes in the right of woman to choose whether to abort or not while mccain is pro life which says life begins at conception and abortion is a crime like murder

8276190 but people are pretty frustrated with congress right now rodriguez has to explain whats going on in washington

8276199 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming

8276218 i bought original real guns of the type we used in
8276219 the weak the marginalized the oppressed and frail have a chance of survival only if they are armed
8276220 we have to do things weve never done before in order to have things weve never had before
8276221 interpreted according to the actual intent of the founding fathers
8276222 which are some of the most depressing places on earth
8276223 most of her aides thought we should just arrest them all
8276224 i said we should just leave them there the only person in the room who agreed with me was the police chief jerry sanders
8276225 when max rafferty beat him we suddenly realized we were going to win
8276226 people would come up to me in the supermarket and get all in my face i had too thin a skin
8276227 we wanted someone who could kind of push the envelope on these things
8276228 he doesnt just walk away at the end of the election
8276229 even pete wilson couldnt get it done everyone always thought it would get laid at the feet of the taxpayers
8276230 they were using me to get to hedgecock i was facing 14 felony counts and after he went down they offered me a misdemeanor
8276231 i decided that i never wanted to be in the ethical gray area again
8276232 there are some consultants who still believe the ends always justify the means but im not that way anymore
8276233 i think his career could have had a wonderful arc to it
8276234 the core problem there is that roger got railroaded and tom understood the unfairness of it and it turned him into somebody who became bitter and disillusioned
8276235 he will pretty grossly misrepresent positions for political purposes thats part of the hardball
8276236 except that if theyre accurate and if theyre fair they work
8276237 but that was his way back into the establishment he never looked back
8276238 i dont think anyone had done that before now its standard
8276239 you cant depend on students to remember election day theyre too busy getting stoned on the beach or studying or whatever
8276240 so i devised all these goofy ways to get them registered with absentee ballots and to get them to send them in
8276241 there are people who debate the effectiveness of that but i think almost every election ive won weve won the absentee vote
8276242 the most important part of consulting is to have good candidates
8276243 the trick was to persuade the suburbs that these would be good for them
8276244 we had to figure out how to get over that then we decided to poll on locations the downtown location polled at 60 percent because of its connection with redevelopment so we spent the summer doing this kabuki dance lucchino pushed for a stadium by the sea moores for a mission valley site and golding for downtown eventually we gave in to golding
8276245 i figure when you have a partisan campaign you have 10 15 percent of the undecideds to work with
8276246 i dont have any involvement with public policy strategies besides whats required for my ownership stake
8276247 i dont lobby my clients and nobody in my company lobbies my clients because i believe its a conflict
8276248 how can you trust the advice im giving you if im being paid by somebody else to give it to you
8276249 to say that somebody on my payroll is lobbying them and its not me to me thats a distinction without a difference
8276250 sometimes wed talk about what was going on but mostly it was to gossip
8276251 a lot of times id reach out to him or hed reach out to me on certain issues and how these issues were playing out or just to gossip
8276252 he has a lot of clients and a lot of polls
8276253 he usually had a pretty good idea of what people were thinking and talking about
8276254 but i had to spend the next three months repairing the damage

8276260 i hope that those who are responsible for the soul of our land will take steps to address this development and stop the programme from being aired
8276261 if the youth are exposed to this dehumanising and impoverished programme in the hope of making some dollar who should we blame
8276262 one is not surprised that young unemployed energetic but desperate nigerians would be rushing to be admitted into a programme of this nature
8276263 we keep appealing to the media to be a channel of human enrichment but one constantly feels that it is bent on propagating a valueless culture
8276264 over the last seven years ygaward has grown massively and now competes in credibility and scale of entries with a lot of the more established shows we are very conscious of wanting to keep the spirit and tone of the show true to the original premise regardless of how wide it now reaches and asked the guys at droga5 to think of a non advertising way of pushing the shows iconoclastic mantra further essentially they came back with a product idea which in our case is the show itself and the idea for the site and campaign grew naturally from there
8276265 some of us are still young enough to remember the lashing we got as juniors coming up through the business its a bit of a rites of passage thing like army boot camp but with less sleep and more beatings quit in style is designed to become a sort of secret fight club for junior creatives where they can meet to compare war stories and more importantly ideas of getting one over on their slave master cds before they move on to the next challenge its basically a tool box for the underdogs
8276266 weve created over 25 films thanks to collaborating with directors from as far away as hungryman in new york and greatguns in los angeles but i think its just the beginning juniors are nothing if not crafty and when they realise they can become infamous as well as win a specially made matt black bullet through this thing i reckon they wont need too much encouragement to pull out the camcorder
8276267 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8276268 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004

8276272 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent

8276274 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8276275 when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8276276 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama
8276277 i just liked how many people had their signs up
8276278 go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8276279 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8276280 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8276281 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8276282 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8276283 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8276284 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8276285 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8276286 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8276287 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8276288 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8276289 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8276290 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8276291 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8276292 while star wars related tickets may not come on a blister card have 19 points of articulation or come with a certificate of authenticity many collectors are beginning to discover the unique appeal of these often discarded scraps of flimsy cardstock which at face value dont seem to offer much a title venue date time and perhaps the price of admission but those five bits of information are also able to connect fans emotionally to the events themselves whether its viewing the sagas latest chapter for the first time touring an exhibit of costumes and props enjoying a symphony of star wars music or attending a star studded fan convention information recorded on ticket stubs also documents some historical facts about the event what time of year it took place how much it cost how long it ran and where it happened for fans that enjoy exploring every historical nuance of the star wars phenomenon these unassuming facts can be gold for new collectors tickets bearing the star wars title in are still extremely affordable since their appeal has not yet been widely recognized this untapped area of star wars collecting has great potential to grow as fans begin to get nostalgic about the events that have defined their star wars experiences over the years in the case of theater admission tickets small town single screen venues are quickly being replaced by megaplexes lending some added historical interest to tickets bearing the names of those classic old movie houses but collecting star wars theatrical tickets is just the beginning star wars has offered all sorts of extracurricular activities throughout the past countless conventions scores of concerts theme park rides and museum exhibits around the world tickets to these events make fascinating mementos for fans to take away and can also be conveniently displayed in frames or scrapbooks

8276300 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8276301 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8276302 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8276303 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8276304 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8276305 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8276306 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8276307 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8276308 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8276309 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8276310 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8276311 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments

8276315 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8276316 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8276317 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8276318 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8276319 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8276320 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8276321 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8276322 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8276323 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had

8276332 and one other small note you probably saw the picture yesterday of senator clintons parade of pantsuits they were testing the colors during her i love the guys up there testing the color of the suit well as you know they wanted to know which went best with a blue background and decided on the bright orange pantsuit couldnt have been lost on any broncos fans out here in denver she was the ultimate fan because there it is blue and orange colors of the broncos

8276344 right now hes scaring him off and he has little chance of being caught and hell just go on to the next place
8276345 since we put the photos we caught between five and 10 people who shoplifted some customers walking by recognize the people in the photos and tell us others turn themselves in

8276362 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8276363 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8276364 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8276365 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8276366 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8276367 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8276368 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8276369 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8276370 well let you know if we can use your services
8276371 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8276372 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8276373 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8276374 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8276375 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8276376 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8276377 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8276378 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8276379 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8276380 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8276381 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8276382 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8276383 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8276384 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8276385 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8276386 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8276387 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8276388 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8276389 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8276390 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8276391 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8276392 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8276393 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture

8276400 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8276401 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8276402 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8276403 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8276404 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8276405 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8276406 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8276407 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8276408 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8276409 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8276410 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them

8276412 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8276413 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8276414 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8276415 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8276416 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8276417 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8276418 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8276423 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8276424 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8276425 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8276426 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8276427 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8276428 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow

8276430 take away the context of this campaign year and they could be pals perhaps even big and little brothers of the democratic family the so called first black president mentors a prospective real black president but context is everything in politics and because of that their relationship is anything but close
8276431 he intends to do what is expected of him according to many friends and associates and try to convince the public that obama has the toughness and wisdom to be commander in chief
8276432 but though the speech might be as important to clinton as it is to obama those close to him say he will deliver it with lingering feelings of estrangement that have surprisingly little to do with the fact that obama defeated his wife in the primaries clinton associates long familiar with his habits and rhythms say it would take little more than phone calls on a somewhat regular basis to keep him satisfied
8276433 were excited about president clintons speech because we think its going to be a really electric moment in the convention hall when he gets up to speak
8276434 we believe he will be warmly received and enthusiastically revived by the entire convention
8276435 clinton knows the challenges and choices that face our chief executive hell talk about why barack obama is the right person to lead america right now and why senator mccains promises are more of the same and the wrong choice for america
8276436 the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
8276437 believe me im not happy about paying 3 80 for a gallon of gasoline and i know youre not either
8276438 i concur with that view and believe current fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8276439 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8276440 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8276441 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8276442 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8276443 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8276444 we dont want people to be out of pocket when they volunteer for us
8276445 we want to take care of our volunteers so they can take care of our clients
8276446 theyve been wonderful a wonderful help and theyve just kept me going mrs abbott said
8276447 i consider them all to be my friends i think they deserve a gold medal
8276448 its not just meals on wheels everything is going up
8276449 i have naturally drawn in i dont do the things i used to do
8276450 i will continue i try not to ask for special favours because they meals on wheels do so much
8276451 meals on wheels is brilliant my mother used to do some volunteering for it years ago and my grandmother was also a recipient
8276452 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8276453 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8276454 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8276455 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8276456 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8276457 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8276458 it is our belief that neither side wants a strike
8276459 the presentation that the iam recently made to investors had a host of elements that overlap with the companys long term goals they include concerns over an aging workforce and excessive outsourcing
8276460 theres no question that it made the south more conservative the democrats not contesting the south
8276461 you know when i came to georgia in the 1980s overwhelmingly the georgia congressional delegation was democratic the governor was democratic and the legislature was democratic and they were not right wing democrats some of them were very progressive i think what happened is when the republicans played their race card in the south the democrats abandoned the south and as a result the south became more and more conservative because the democrats were not contesting the south that was and is a terrible mistake
8276462 the other thing that happened is that unions pulled out of the south basically concluding you could not win
8276463 that was not our experience in the 80s and 90s unions started putting their resources into places that were easier so the result is that half the union membership in america is concentrated in six states thats not a good situation because it really corrals our effect on american society
8276464 in the early 70s when i went there the south was a place where the perception or label was that you could not organize was not what i found
8276465 but workers are not anti union in the south employers in the south are the press politicians and employers but not workers i found that workers if they felt like there was a way to win that they would fight
8276466 southern employers in the 70s 80s and even 90s were more willing to divide workers by playing the race card than they were in the north
8276467 lifes more complicated now in the south i think people are less susceptible to that youve got immigrants youve got latinos youve got asians in our plant in atlanta youve got all kinds of african and asian immigrants its not as simple for the companies to divide the workers
8276468 hes contesting north carolina were going to carry virginia i think georgias within reach mississippi you know people talk about mississippi as a backwater state ive worked in mississippi my whole career democrats have always done well there and mississippi has a progressive tradition
8276469 obama brings a very different perspective obama views the south not as a place that is different or special and as a place where we could win in its key that the democratic party not write off the south and its key that labor unions not write the south off
8276470 sure the game is rigged but you cant win if you dont play
8276471 anyone who believes that the company will take care of you you need to put sheep after your name
8276472 i walk through this world of loneliness and greed ill never make enough money to give me what i need if it cant buy love cant buy piece of mind i guess a million bucks aint worth a poor mans dime
8276473 im a homesick gypsy i was born moving down the line im a homesick gypsy i aint home till i leave you behind
8276474 and the iranian reaction would definitely make the enemy regret both its decision and action
8276475 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8276476 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8276477 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8276478 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8276479 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8276480 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8276481 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8276482 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8276483 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8276484 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8276485 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8276486 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8276487 i made clear that i would have expected that one would discuss the issue in the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce or in the un security council before unilateral recognition
8276488 our deepest sympathies are with the soldiers family and friends as they deal with their loss
8276489 if we are talking about scos move from an economic organization to a military one then this has already happened all the member states were willing in response to the strengthening of nato
8276490 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8276491 were not afraid of anything of a new cold war
8276492 if our partners want to maintain good relations with russia they will understand our decision
8276493 but silence on this question will de facto mean agreement and more importantly china will move to block any economic sanctions against russia within the un
8276494 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8276495 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8276496 coalition forces bombed the taliban and killed more than 40 militants

8276500 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8276501 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8276502 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8276503 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8276504 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8276505 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8276506 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8276507 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8276508 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8276509 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8276510 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8276511 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8276512 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8276513 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8276514 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8276515 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8276516 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8276517 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8276518 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8276519 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8276520 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8276521 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8276522 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8276523 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8276524 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8276525 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8276526 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8276527 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8276528 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8276529 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8276530 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8276531 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8276532 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8276533 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8276534 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8276535 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8276536 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8276537 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8276538 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8276539 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8276540 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8276541 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8276542 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8276543 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8276544 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8276545 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8276546 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8276547 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8276548 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

8276551 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

8276592 we need to know about things such as erosion about natural resources and which areas are suitable for agriculture gis enables us to do so as it combines all relevant and necessary information in one visual system
8276593 geographic information technology systems when incorporating features such as climatologic information water sources infrastructure and soil structure could show us which regions in africa as a whole or in individual african countries are suitable for what kind of agriculture
8276594 these systems are also capable of showing what natural resources exist in a specific region is there fresh water for instance and what is the land coverage and soil structure
8276595 also are there markets where farmers can sell their produce and what is the infrastructure like there may be markets but if there are no roads that lead to them you will be unable to sell your products
8276596 the pesticides that are washing down the lake as a result of farming combined with the wild growth of the alien invasive water hyacinth are disastrous for the fish stocks and fisheries this situation could be more efficiently monitored with a gis
8276597 it was green because of algae today the potomac is healthy and blue again the gis gave the authorities the tools to monitor the situation and to develop a strategy to deal with the problem
8276598 if you know where people live it is easier to decide where to build a school or a clinic
8276599 a geographical information system may also assist authorities in mapping malaria hotspots in relation to where people live this information is a key to developing anti malaria drives

8276628 ever since lindsay got out of rehab and all these people came back into her life things havent been right
8276629 people like samantha ronson dont need to be around lindsay she shouldnt be dragging lindsay around nightclubs who was samantha ronson before lindsay lohan she was nobody she is using her for her own gain all these people have inserted themselves into her life like parasites and its not right im done with them
8276630 dina is a kiss ass shes just nice to everybody trying to be friends with everyone just so she can be on lindsays good side and it is wrong she should be a mother first
8276631 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8276632 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8276633 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
8276634 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8276635 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8276636 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8276637 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8276638 you keep on going but like i said ill look at the situation in december

8276651 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration

8276654 she told me she wasnt going to die and leave her children

8276665 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well
8276666 tara is more shy tara is more easily intimidated shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8276667 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me
8276668 i must emphasise that the true earnings of the companies making up our group for the full 12 month period are r371m
8276669 but over the last 12 months the picture changed strong operating momentum is now propelling genuine operational growth despite us economic weakness
8276670 acquisitions and cost cuts have accounted for most of ibm s growth in recent years in the 10 years ended 2006 sales increased at an annualized rate of less than 2 and the company lost both market share and in uence
8276671 however sales growth has accelerated in each of the last three quarters and per share pro ts have risen at least 23 in each period
8276672 a broad business mix has helped the company keep growing during the economic slowdown
8276673 hardware accounted for about 18 of sales in the six months ended june while services represented 58 and software generated 20 financing operations brought in most of the last 4
8276674 while the current economic climate has pinched the consumer companies are still investing heavily in new technology
8276675 in the june quarter ibm signed 14 7 billion in service contracts up 12 increasing the services backlog to 117 billion nearly twice annual services revenue
8276676 software revenue jumped 15 in the six months ended june services and software growth more than offset a 2 decline in revenue from the systems and technology unit which produces servers and other hardware
8276677 ibm is also benefiting from its strong presence overseas particularly in emerging markets foreign sales accounted for 63 of 2007 revenue a percentage likely to increase in coming years
8276678 management expressed concern about economic weakness in some of the world s largest developed markets including the u s but that worry has been factored into growth expectations
8276679 dopo questa fase riusciremo a recuperare il terreno per novembre sono ottimista
8276680 i think the dollars bullish trend is set to continue and a further 20 rally from current levels seems not a question of if but when says nick vardy the international stock expert and editor of the dxdbx is a leveraged bet on a sustained dollar rally
8276681 after flirting with record lows against the euro in july the u s dollar hit a six month high against the euro as the economic slowdown outside of the united states gathered pace
8276682 the popular decoupling theory that the rest of the worlds economies can continue to thrive while the u s economy slows has proven to be bunk as it turns out other global economies not the u s are flirting with recession
8276683 it was recently announced that the 13 nation euro area economy shrank in the second quarter as the economies of germany france and italy all contracted
8276684 and because inflation in the eurozone is far too high for comfort few expect the ecb to cut interest rates before 2009 that means that you can expect european economies and the euro to stagnate during the foreseeable future
8276685 relentless negative headlines notwithstanding the u s economy doesnt seem to be in such bad shape after all the u s economy grew at 1 9 in q2 and a surge in export sales in june probably means that gdp growth for the most recent quarter will be revised upward
8276686 the u s economy also has the most to gain from the recent fall in the price of oil and is likely to recover more quickly than its counterparts in europe and asia
8276687 that also means u s interest rates will head higher sooner to provide a further boost for the dollar and the dollar s revival is likely to put to rest talk of global central banks and other large holders of reserve assets diversifying out of the u s dollar
8276688 so how far would a dollar rally go on measures such as purchasing power parity the u s dollar still looks cheap against the euro the swedish crown the swiss frank and the u k pound sterling a further 20 rally from current levels seems not a question of if but when
8276689 the best way to play the dollar rally is to buy the direxion funds dollar bull 2 5x fund a leveraged fund that seeks daily returns of 250 of the price performance of the u s dollar against six major world currencies the euro yen pound canadian dollar swedish krona and swiss franc

8276712 business is being disadvantaged by the unfair tactics of mtc which charges exorbitant interconnection fees from their network to fixed lines
8276713 contrary to claims by both parties when they have finally woken up to realise that their businesses are bleeding from mistakes they have made in the past mtc never imposed the regime interconnection rates but accepted what was proposed by both cell one and telecom namibia
8276714 the huge gap in interconnecting charges not only discourages customers from calling the telecom namibia network but also make service unaffordable for many namibians inasmuch as the interconnection rates are arbitrarily set and thus not cost based
8276715 cost based interconnection charges should incorporate a normal commercial return and there should not be any discrimination among different operators unless a cost difference justifies dissimilar treatment

8276725 to act in this fashion we as executives have to resist our natural tendency to avoid or minimize risks which of course is much easier said than done in the movie business and plenty of others this instinct leads executives to choose to copy successes rather than try to create something brand new thats why you see so many movies that are so much alike it also explains why a lot of films arent very good if you want to be original you have to accept the uncertainty even when its uncomfortable and have the capability to recover when your organization takes a big risk and fails whats the key to being able to recover talented people
8276726 creative power in a film has to reside with the films creative leadership as obvious as this might seem its not true of many companies in the movie industry and i suspect a lot of others we believe the creative vision propelling each movie comes from one or two people and not from either corporate executives or a development department our philosophy is you get great creative people you bet big on them you give them enormous leeway and support and you provide them with an environment in which they can get honest feedback from everyone
8276727 cyber crime and cyber security are the greatest and perhaps most dangerous threat to the development of mankind living on the planet earth today
8276728 we have not appointed anyone as yet but we are in the process of appointing someone soon and my hope is that we finalise everything before the end of this week
8276729 interconnecting rates are brought to a competitive level and that such rates are cost based
8276730 presently telecom business is disadvantaged by the unfair tactics of mtc which charges exorbitant interconnection fees from their network to fixed lines
8276731 the huge gap in interconnecting charges not only discourages customers from calling telecoms network but also makes services unaffordable for many namibians in as much as the interconnection rates are arbitrarily set and thus not cost based this is unacceptable and will make it very tough for telecom and other players to compete fairly in the market
8276732 another spook is the cost of international tariffs to and from cellular phones
8276733 why then are namibians willingly paying the penalty when calling local businesses in namibia or internationally
8276734 telecom namibia therefore urges the namibia communications commission ncc to intervene as a matter of urgency in order to bring sanity on the telecommunications sector especially by ensuring that interconnecting rates are brought to a competitive level and that such rates are cost based

8276815 even had the chutzpah to make these funds transfers through its u s branches right under the nose of the justice department despite the fact that hamas and the palestine islamic jihad are designated terrorist organizations and that such wire transfers are a crime under american law we expect the bank of china to now pay very heavily for its support for terrorism
8276816 there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova

8276835 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
8276836 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
8276837 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

8276839 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
8276840 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
8276841 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
8276842 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
8276843 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
8276844 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
8276845 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
8276846 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
8276847 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
8276848 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
8276849 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
8276850 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
8276851 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
8276852 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

8276876 they are not even at liberty to tell us how much of the 50 million in cuts over the next two years announced yesterday have to be carried out in melbourne so we are still nervously waiting to hear what our number is

8276883 social security affects poverty among the elderly in two offsetting ways while it reduces poverty by providing income to retired persons it discourages private saving during the working years the net effect of this is increased poverty among the retired population to understand this conclusion it is important to compare the rate of return on taxes paid that is generated by social security to the rate of return people could receive on their private saving for those retiring in 2008 the average implicit real inflation adjusted rate of return on social security taxes paid was slightly below 3 percent and it is scheduled to decline to under 2 percent in the next forty years in contrast if people retiring in 2008 had invested the taxes they paid into social security in a balanced portfolio 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds they would have received a return of 5 5 percent

8276887 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8276888 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 percent and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8276889 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8276890 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8276891 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8276892 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8276893 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years
8276894 our customers are spending more time online and we want to help them stay connected with their favorite people and memories
8276895 we all have different running styles so it will depend on whatever situation on a certain play fits our style
8276896 not only is he physically gifted but hes also got about as good a work ethic as anybody on our team and thats saying something because i think a lot of our guys work hard dougs got an edge to him and a chip on his shoulder but he doesnt say two words out there during practice he just goes hard on every play
8276897 dougs time will come sooner or later hes going play and get on the field this fall
8276898 i think hes going be on every single special team and be a force there were going to get him the ball at tailback and line him up at fullback do whatever we can do to get him on the field as much as possible because hes something special hes going to be an exciting player down the road
8276899 hes a special kid one of our best athletes and pound for pound one of the strongest players on the team we just need to be creative in ways to get him on the field and give him the opportunity to showcase his abilities
8276900 maybe he doesnt talk a lot but i dont see that quiet side that much
8276901 he lets his performance speak for itself hes not the type of kid whos going to talk a lot about his accomplishments or his abilities he just goes out and plays
8276902 i think hes very respectful his parents raised him very well i see a young man who enjoys what hes doing and plays the game with a lot of enthusiasm you can see that in practice hes always hopping around he brings a lot of positive energy and thats contagious among his teammates
8276903 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8276904 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8276905 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8276906 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
8276907 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
8276908 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts

8276912 wed have music teachers come in and teach the students a song at least once a week and she was very much into it
8276913 it was just a wonderful moment as a father to see her get up there like that
8276914 shes one of those people who walks in a room and everyone just gravitates to her
8276915 she is fully qualified to share her opinion with everyone
8276916 shell probably stand up to some of the things that simon says
8276917 and i think that she will actually be really honest with the contestants which is good
8276918 the critical challenge we face today is that of the so called trickle down effect as the growth achieved has not significantly contributed to increased employment and a significant reduction in the level of poverty
8276919 with sustained growth and policy interventions to directly address the issue of employment and poverty
8276920 ensuring that the dividends of democracy are shared by a larger segment of our teeming population
8276921 i am confident that with long range planning combined with policy continuity and commitment achieving the vision is quite possible in spite of the negative growth in the oil sector in recent years the performance of the non oil sector has remained buoyant despite the challenges we have in the areas of infrastructure

8276936 thats one of the reasons im here is to continue to lead uncws efforts to increase diversity in the student body

8276941 in the case of the former governor his excellency alhaji abubakar habu hashidu we are delaying the disbursement of his benefits until the end of his appeal so that we would not be misconstrued as inducing him to back pedal on the case
8276942 we are ready to give him all his benefits immediately the case is disposed of because they are his inalienable rights which nobody will deny him
8276943 your excellency may recall that major nigerian news media carried the reports of certain payments made to yourself and your deputy
8276944 these payments were indeed confirmed and defended by both the executive and legislative arms of gombe state government via news media advertorials
8276945 the gombe state house of assembly cited the report of the revenue mobilisation allocation and fiscal commission as a basis for its enactment of the pension law 2007 and 2008 and the subsequent payment
8276946 the commission in a letter to all the state houses of assembly in 2006 advised on the need to enact pension law for governors and the deputies that a person governor or deputy governor shall not be entitled to any pension allowances or privileges under the state if at the material time he holds any elective office in nigeria
8276947 your excellency the report of the commission the reviewed remuneration package for political public and judicial office holders 2007 which the gombe state house of assembly claimed to have based the states pension law upon did not include anything on pension
8276948 the house mistook severance allowance for pension having successfully completed your first term in office you are entitled to only severance allowance at the rate of 300 of your annual basic salary
8276949 the payment of pension to you while still serving your second tenure as the governor and deputy governor does not have the backing of the law
8276950 apart from not heeding to the advice of the commission as stated in paragraph two 2 above the payment violated even the gombe state executive pension amendment law 2008 section 4 1 which clearly states that pension should be paid at the end of your tenure
8276951 may i therefore most respectfully request your excellency and your deputy to refund to the gombe state treasury the sum of n200 072 505 00 and n100 025 388 00 respectively which was paid as pension allowance
8276952 this letter is being copied to all state governors and speakers of state assemblies for their guidance
8276953 a former governor will also be entitled to a personal assistant of his choice who will not be below grade level 10 two vehicles to be replaced every four years two drivers to be recommended by the beneficiary free medical treatment for the beneficiary and his immediate family 30 days annual vacation outside nigeria with estacode for him and wife and one direct telephone line with internet services

8276984 overarching all of these the view is that good stable governance forms the crucial basis for investment
8276985 challenging conventional views on mobile telecommunications investment evidence from conflict zones
8276986 our motivation was first the feeling that conflict zones have been somewhat ignored in the ict4d field despite their importance in the world and then when we looked at those zones we found the unexpected outcome that mobile telephony seemed to be thriving for what then turned out to be partly despite and partly because of reasons related to the conflict
8276987 of course high growth rates could be put down to the very low baseline figures and also the absence of mainline telephony alternatives
8276988 clearly investors have been attracted through the obstacles because of demand and bad governance and insecurity are so interwoven that information must surely have a premium in badly governed regions looking at the pictures from those areas of georgia this week where governance has broken down what do we see people in and out of uniform all on their mobiles
8276989 so we have a conundrum in trying to explain why badly governed states still manage high levels of mobile telecom investment we should probably just leave it at that for now until we get more on the ground evidence
8276990 in terms of icts our article suggests there might also be an effect for mainline phones the high growth rates of mainlines in somalia are particularly intriguing there might be a similar effect for internet investment but its hard to tell the 2001 figures are so low that any sort of increase looks amazing in percentage terms
8276991 for other types of investment your guess is as good as mine of course there will be aid funded investments like roads and other infrastructure but the interesting point about icts is that they appear to have included a lot of private investment
8276992 mobile telecommunications has become the silver bullet du jour of international development and beyond the hype and alongside some exacerbation of inequities it can be seen delivering both social and economic development outcomes yet at least half the worlds population lack access to this development tool

8277119 the majority of our clients use a salary band structure that depending on the role for which the candidate is being considered determines the size and nature of the package offered to the potential employee

8277157 for avoidance of doubt when the audu ogbe led exco was dissolved in 2005 prince ogbulafor as the then national secretary took that decision with equanimity fulfilled he had offered his best to his party he never lobbied mr uba or any other person to retain his position
8277158 perhaps it is time for all members of our great party to realize that the pdp cannot attain the vision of its founding fathers by an aberrant structure to the pervert tradition of yesterday which mr akunna was referring to this tradition of impunity of arbitrariness and of imposition is all gone under ogbulafor there is a new pdp which now belongs to the people consequently only the mass of our members in anambra state can decide who leads their state chapter in whatever capacity to this prince ogbulafor is unrepentantly committed

8277198 i am giving my full support to the vice president he is the right candidate and choice of the people

8277200 i do have considerable political experience dating back to the time i served as member of the central committee in the unip government whilst also participating in several committees
8277201 the political positions i have held have exposed me to the breadth and width of the country other than that i am able to communicate with the grassroots in vernacular quite easily in any part of the country as i speak 29 zambian languages
8277202 my interpretation is that whether the nec decides to fill a casual vacancy of the president of the republic only or president of the party secret voting should be the preferred mode of voting
8277203 in 2001 mazoka almost trounced us because the mmd candidate was more like handpicked so let them hold even a one day convention to elect the presidential candidate and allow the people decide

8277237 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8277238 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8277239 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8277240 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did

8277243 the people of the copperbelt like myself are greatly humbled by the presence of the first lady and the cabinet ministers that are here to mourn with us
8277244 if there were no such thing as the resurrection of the flesh then the truth would lie with gnosticism and every form of idealism down to schopenhauer and hegel for whom the finite must literally perish if it is to become spiritual and infinite but the resurrection of the flesh vindicates the poets in a definitive sense the aesthetic scheme of things which allows us to posses the infinite within the finitude of form however it is seen understood or grasped spiritually is right
8277245 when zambians wanted the first lady to replace the husband as president i stated that the issue of the first lady was for the first family to inform the nation and i also clearly stated that women aspiring for leadership should be of the calibre of the first lady
8277246 i have learnt with the deepest sorrow of the demise of president mwanawasa an active and outstanding leader of political life of zambia
8277247 please accept the expression of my personal condolences and of the italian nation and kindly convey these sentiments to the family of president mwanawasa and the people of zambia

8277259 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8277260 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

8277265 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8277266 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8277267 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8277268 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

8277274 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8277275 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

8277277 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8277278 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8277279 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8277280 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8277281 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8277282 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8277283 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

8277294 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come

8277393 the south korean international full back played 93 times for us following his move from psv eindhoven in august 2005 we wish young pyo well for the future
8277394 fernando and myself managed to link up quite a few times against middlesbrough on saturday so there are definitely a few signs there that the partnership is developing
8277395 it would obviously have been nicer if one of us would have scored but it doesnt really matter who gets the goals as long as someone does and the results follow thats the most important thing
8277396 we know what a big game this is but then every game is a must win when you are at a club like liverpool
8277397 we want to go one further than last year and were confident we can do it
8277398 they were the better team on the night two weeks ago and you have to give them credit
8277399 it was a massive wake up call that they cant be underestimated they have some big physical boys who can also play a bit
8277400 we need to make sure we improve from saturday and see that were on it if not well come unstuck
8277401 its a massive game and we need to play very well but we know were at home and were at a better level than two weeks ago so were very confident well win the game
8277402 it was a disastrous result for us really but fair play to northampton because they came here set their stall out and made it difficult for us
8277403 the referee has sent off gary cahill and i dont want to start having a go at him but it was a bit harsh because gary was committed to the challenge and wasnt going for the man
8277404 weve spoke after the game and we cant be happy with that performance we know as players that we have let ourselves down as well as the gaffer the staff and the fans
8277405 this was a massive chance for us to go on and do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe through this route but it wasnt to be and now its all our attention to the league because thats all we have got until the end of december
8277406 now its down to us to make sure we stay up with the big boys and keep in the top eight from now until that time
8277407 i would think he wont go to ireland we will look to the champion stakes at newmarket
8277408 he ran a super race on saturday and hes fine
8277409 we want young people to know that there is help out there and that there are many safe activities being funded by the government which they can take part in
8277410 the evening will educate young people on the types of drugs available on the streets and their dangers there will be drugs agencies giving information about their services as well as food music and live performances by zimbabwe youth groups all are welcome to attend
8277411 he doesnt want to join either of them city or everton and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8277412 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8277413 he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8277414 i can tell you the deal is a permanent one we are not speaking about a loan
8277415 gets hit on or asked out about five times a week
8277416 you know youre a grown up when you can afford to buy hundreds of dollars of candy and you dont

8277418 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
8277419 she had piled hundreds of dollars worth of everything from meats to potted plants in it
8277420 apparently she just rolled this huge buggy of stuff out the door
8277421 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8277422 thats a fair question i just dont know the answer
8277423 its time for the west to recognize the link between its actions in the balkans and instability in the caucasus

8277462 were seeing all sorts of ways in which these people can put out the message to first time voters and those who are unsure of their voting rights they are replacing the tactics we saw in previous election cycles
8277463 knowingly provide false information with the intent to disenfranchise another person in a federal election
8277464 by early november were expecting spam emails to be sent giving the wrong location for a polling station or incorrect details about who has the right to vote
8277465 theres even a web site thats offering to register voters for 9 95 of course it doesnt cost anything to vote
8277466 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections

8277498 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect

8277510 i dont know about you but it seems to me that none of these lines or situations are the least bit funny
8277511 listen we can mix a few different fonts or we can even use bank gothic or harrington to make the ad look kind of cool but since we cast steve carrell and therefore everyone is going to go to the movie anyway we at the pub dept think we can save a couple grand and just use bauhaus 93 which is very very readable and doesnt put off kids and illiterates
8277512 every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
8277513 it was stressed that the deal should include the entire issues without any exception and without any partial or interim agreements
8277514 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word
8277515 not say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected

8277521 the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
8277522 i think the speech was amazing i am a clinton supporter and wasnt planning on voting for obama i am now because that speech reminded me why i am a clinton supporter and that obama will fight for the same causes

8277527 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
8277528 we plain ran out of time the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8277529 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
8277530 im definitely bummed about these api removals i was particularly looking forward to the p2p capabilities offered by gtalkservice but as always user security and privacy must come first

8277570 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8277571 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8277572 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8277573 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8277574 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8277575 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8277576 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8277577 no one is suggesting that we choose our leaders by who among them is the funniest or the most rhetorically stirring on the whole demonstrated competence in office is still a good bet and the most useful way to judge politicians is on their records

8277581 tenemos que demostrarle a los jaliscienses que estamos tomando las decisiones que nos competen he recibido miles de llamadas de estudiantes y padres de familia solidariz ndose con esta medida
8277582 estas dos decisiones forman parte de la materializaci n de la voluntad pol tica expresa del rector general para reorientar acad micamente el rumbo de la instituci n
8277583 deber definir la comunidad en consulta p blica que se debe hacer con el auditorio yo creo que posiblemente haya muchos empresarios en jalisco que quisieran darnos lo que cuesta los m s de mil millones de pesos y con eso yo le propondr a la comunidad que me digan en qu los invertimos
8277584 no hay ni habr ning n poder pol tico ni liderazgo f ctico por encima de la instituci n
8277585 no me van a destituir de la udeg no hay mayor a en el cgu que pueda estar por encima de la ley
8277586 a los miles de estudiantes a los miles de profesores trabajadores a que derroquemos esta dictadura pol tica en la udeg es tiempo de despertar
8277587 todos los funcionarios deber n darle cuentas a la comunidad que representan los que vayan a rendir cuentas a san juan de los lagos 111 casa particular de ra l padilla o alguna de sus oficinas deber n dar cuentas
8277588 la udeg informa a las empresas y organismos relacionados que el c ra l padilla l pez dej de laborar en el fideicomiso del ccu y el consejo de administraci n del corporativo de empresas universitarias por lo cual se desconoce cualquier trato que a nombre de estos organismos haga
8277589 no veo condiciones para que padilla siga con sus cargos
8277590 no veo condiciones para que contin e sin embargo reconozco que en algunas cosas l en otro esquema un esquema institucional l pudiera tener cabida en algunos espacios pero tendr amos que repensar y discutir el tema cultural yo no comparto su visi n de cultura es una cultura elitista es espect culo show business qu tiene que ver lupita dalessio con la cultura con la cultura popular s pero eso no es negocio de la universidad eso no es funci n lo de andar organizando conciertos de lupita dalessio o de juan gabriel
8277591 no yo no dije que iba a venderlo adem s yo no puedo venderlo es una facultad del centro cultural universitario eso es lo que estoy criticando adem s andan ofreciendo el 10 por ciento de la acciones del estadio jalisco al ayuntamiento de guadalajara a cambio de que nos den ampliaci n a 66 a os del comodato qui n los autoriz el rector no los autoriz el consejo tampoco por qu andan haciendo eso

8277597 a demarca o em rea cont nua o retorno vida tribal e ao isolamento traduzem talvez o sonho de alguns antrop logos e religiosos nada tem a ver com a aspira o da maioria da popula o ind gena

8277604 establece claramente que ser la universidad de guadalajara por conducto de su rector general quien designe al presidente y al secretario que fue lo que hizo el pasado rector trinidad padilla l pez cuando se refiere a la universidad por conducto del rector quiere decir que el rector es un ejecutor de una instrucci n que le env a la universidad y qui n es la universidad pues es el rgano m ximo de gobierno que es el consejo general universitario de tal manera que ser a el consejo quien tendr a que emitir esta decisi n si es que as lo decidiera conveniente para que esto pueda ejecutarse
8277605 el fideicomiso tampoco le da a l a carlos brise o facultades para revocar a nadie
8277606 es libre de pensar o interpretar una cl usula a su manera
8277607 todo surge de una interpretaci n inadecuada de su parte en la cl usula octava que establece de manera muy clara que al rector general le corresponde designar yo no veo porque tanto brinco estando el suelo tan parejo es una designaci n a un cargo honor fico
8277608 la verdad es que no creo que sea algo posible y me parece que ser a lamentable que sucediera
8277609 ha generado una cantidad de espect culos y de cultura no entiendo el por qu de los comentarios del rector los resultados del trabajo que hemos hecho avalan que el auditorio ha dado resultados positivos en muchos aspectos estamos convencidos de que el auditorio es una empresa universitaria sana que genera beneficios para la casa de estudios ser a lamentable privar a la universidad de estos beneficios
8277610 yo ratifico el compromiso que tengo con la autonom a universitaria y conf o en que habr n de resolver esas diferencias apelo a la responsabilidad de los l deres universitarios para que nuestra casa de estudios mantenga por encima de todo el inter s de formar a las y los jaliscienses y a la mejora permanente de la vida acad mica
8277611 las diferencias en la udeg se han agudizado y radicalizado

8277616 la universidad de guadalajara por conducto de su rector general nombrar al presidente y al secretario del comit t cnico quienes tendr n los derechos y obligaciones que establece el presente contrato
8277617 creo que el bot n que menos deb amos tocar a la universidad es en el mbito cultural
8277618 el choque con los rganos de gobierno no creo que lo lleve a buenos resultados
8277619 con quien o quienes tenga a bien designar dicha instituci n educativa
8277620 s lo l sabe con qu prop sito me denuesta
8277621 nunca ha sido mi prop sito funda etapas en la udeg
8277622 contrasta con la que utilizaba en el pasado cuando se exced a en proferir muy a mi pesar elogios dirigidos a un servidor inmerecidos por cierto ahora me denuesta con qu prop sito s lo l lo sabe
8277623 fundar etapas eras o pocas en la historia de la universidad
8277624 el consejo de ra l porque no es s lo mi amigo desde hace muchos a os es mi mentor pol tico le debo haber logrado mucha experiencia mucho conocimiento de asuntos universitarios es muy respetuoso de la institucionalidad
8277625 nada m s afortunado en mi vida haber encontrado el liderazgo de ra l padilla y que me haya incorporado en su esquema y en su esfera le pido su opini n en muchas cosas pero las decisiones del rector son las decisiones del rector
8277626 hay un di logo tan maduro tan responsable tan de altura entre ra l y yo que no creo que haya asunto que vaya en estos seis a os a causar una fractura absolutamente y lo digo con toda conciencia y responsabilidad entre ra l padilla y carlos brise o no hay y no habr fractura pol tica

8277724 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level

8277739 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8277740 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8277741 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8277742 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8277743 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8277744 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people

8277754 it happened that one ex governor whose money was confiscated in the u k at the time the money was returning to nigeria all the monies were gone because the solicitors out there said they were charging 500 per hour all the money went and nothing came to nigeria just peanuts
8277755 prevention is better than cure for instance in a case of murder one gets killed and even when you round up the culprits and bring them to justice a life has been wasted it can never be restored where the state allows the death penalty for instance and there is conspiracy for murder people are rounded up and executed more lives are lost
8277756 if you had prevented that one murder from taking place it is the same with economic crimes when monies are taken outside our shores
8277757 some chief executives of local councils no longer reside in the domain they were elected to administer
8277758 they drive to the council headquarters in their jeeps from state capitals or the federal capital territory as the case may be pay salaries and share other monies and disappear until it is time to share the next subvention

8277823 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8277824 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8277825 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8277826 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8277827 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe
8277828 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
8277829 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8277830 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8277831 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo

8277838 second for your argument to have solid import you must demonstrate that official infallible decrees dogmas on faith and morals my list not yours are somehow
8277839 then you embrace a different form of sola scriptura than the confessional reformers your form would be more in line with a socinus than with a calvin
8277840 me and they were interpreting the ot in a manner contrary at many points with the hermenutical principle you embrace
8277841 me this raises two questions for me first when did the catholic church become
8277842 and second is there any church and or individual who does not have some error in their teaching and life
8277843 me and the primary hermeneutic of jesus and the apostles was
8277844 craft beer is hand made by real people and it has nuances and character that beer from the big breweries does not
8277845 the black creek brews fest is a wonderful opportunity for people to learn about ontarios rich brewing history
8277846 todays craft brewers are continuing a proud tradition and the brews fest at black creek pioneer village is an opportunity for people to discover some refreshing and fantastic local beers and to meet the people who brew them right in our backyard
8277847 this festival is important for the gta because it puts beer into a cultural and family context
8277848 you can bring the kids and have fun learning about beer not just the taste but the cultural and historical aspects as well the brews fest is a chance to discover beer as the noble beverage it is rather than the party drink you see in tv commercials

8277857 nothing its just really good to have you here rodney
8277858 no no no what are you trying to do kill yourself
8277859 hmm she was president hayes chief negotiator when they first revealed the existence of the stargate to the rest of the world currently shes trying to negotiate a truce with russia having already brought over most of the european union not the british though or any of the commonwealth countries australia canada
8277860 he was killed at the start of the troubles and thats what forced landry to take over the presidency and declare martial law
8277861 hayes lost control of the situation and people were dying out there rioting and looting mass murders xenophobia and total paranoia he mobilized the national guard and recalled all retired military back to active duty he recalled troops from afghanistan and iraq and brought order back to the country
8277862 well sumner didnt last long in atlantis either and command passed to then major john sheppard
8277863 if its the same sheppard then hes a full bird colonel in command of petersen air base and the f302 squadrons bit of a maverick
8277864 if you do go to atlantis youll need him he has the strongest expression of the ata gene known on the planet with the possible exception of general oneill
8277865 do you mean colonel jack oneill former sg 1 team leader
8277866 we had to leave him behind in antarctica when the russians overran the outpost still frozen
8277867 last we heard from thor theyd lost badly to the replicators and were preparing to commit racial suicide
8277868 never answered when we called for help against the ori
8277869 look sam i know you mean well but lets face it your reality fared a little better than our own im not sure where the jumping off point was but we took this road and you took another
8277870 at a high level maybe but there are already too many key differences between our realities for them to ever converge
8277871 i know but with all im telling you maybe youll do better than us when you do get back out there and find atlantis
8277872 of course youll also need carson beckett if you decide to go he developed the artificial ata gene therapy which you both needed
8277873 ive already had the gene therapy becketts research was funded by one of my companies and i needed the gene so i could interact with the ancient technology
8277874 hmm must have forgotten and it only works on 48 percent of test subjects anyway
8277875 seems you must at least have the genetic receptors in your dna make up or the gene therapy fails beckett hasnt figured out a way to get around that yet
8277876 take beckett with you anyway you and he were good friends and radek zelenka
8277877 the czech scientist at the ancient outpost working with the russians
8277878 we barely had time to get the chair and remaining drones out of there and needed to leave at least enough technology behind to power oneills stasis chamber
8277879 actually the stasis chamber has an independent power source as a safety precaution probably drew in the initial power it required when the zpm was installed if id been there at the time i could have told them to take the whole stasis unit too
8277880 what are the chances the russians have left the stasis chamber intact
8277881 pretty good actually colonel chekov is in command he and oneill clashed often at the sgc before it all went public and to hell but they had a certain amount of respect for one another and oneill did save the planet
8277882 if you get the chance try to do something to help colonel mitchell hes a good man and deserves better treatment
8277883 i couldnt have done it without you rodney least not so quickly anyway
8277884 well that stands to reason i am after all a genius
8277885 well dr mckay how far had you and colonel carter got with the power problems on the device before she left
8277886 we havent the time to organize an expedition to another galaxy even if it was possible to open the stargate
8277887 and before you ask we cant spare either the daedalus or the prometheus either not while there are ori warships in this galaxy until you find a way to power up that device doctor those ships remain our sole line of defense
8277888 for what its worth you did the right thing sending her back but we may just lose the planet because of that
8277889 this isnt a punishment colonel president landry has asked for you explicitly effective immediately
8277890 you have one hour to make the necessary hand over arrangements
8277891 colonel sheppard im dr rodney mckay welcome to area 51
8277892 you heard the general colonel so if youll sit back and concentrate
8277893 like hell i will mckay im not doing anything until you tell me what this is and why im here
8277894 fine this is an ancient weapons chair and you have the strongest expression of the ata gene since since colonel oneill
8277895 as you can see colonel i really am tired so if you can say what you want to say really fast then ill just be on my way to bed
8277896 i was reading through the alternate carters notes and saw mention of them finding one of those zpms in egypt
8277897 and landry sent in a team to dig it up secretly of course and found nothing in our universe there was no oneill jackson carter and tealc to go back in time steal the zpm from apophis and stash it conveniently in a cave for us to find
8277898 but that just means the delorean of gateships is still here in area 51 and maybe we could
8277899 are you crazy one simple mistake and the whole time line would be altered and despite sams opinions to the contrary a lot of us have done very well in this timeline thank you very much
8277900 and that includes you or are you forgetting the black mark and the wraith lieutenant colonel
8277901 but they didnt witness thousands of their own people killed by their own military
8277902 lets plug into their universe in a few years time when they have to go public with the news that thousands of life sucking aliens are about to harvest the planet
8277903 im just saying the zpm in egypt is a possibility if push comes to shove
8277904 if push comes to shove colonel theres an ancient warship heading towards earth just passed the midway point between our two galaxies and they have zpms on board maybe we can convince landry to send the daedalus out there and offer them a lift back to earth in return for a zpm or two or the means of recharging our own
8277905 im as desperate as anyone on the planet to get the merlin device working again
8277906 its time to relax some aspects of martial law in particular i plan to lift the curfew on us citizens and allow greater freedom of travel within the united states military checkpoints will be withdrawn from areas where deemed no longer necessary
8277907 then figure something out doctor mckay because the ori will be back and wed better be ready
8277908 are a few more scientists dr grodin has come highly recommended from our british allies and of course you know dr beckett who has officially joined our medical personnel
8277909 ill leave you to get acquainted with your new staff doctor
8277910 lorne i think we have a situation here seal the mountain and blast doors from level 21 up to open on my authorization only
8277911 its locked ill try to open it from this side
8277912 colonel were under attack sir president landry is down i repeat the president is down
8277913 lorne i need you to hold sublevel 28 im bringing mckay
8277914 im a doctor not a bloody fireman let me go get a wheelchair
8277915 whats happening is it the trust whyd they lock us all into the infirmary
8277916 lorne i have the package and im on my way eta two minutes
8277917 levels 25 to 28 are secure all levels above 21 have been locked down as per your order if we can secure levels 21 through 24 as well then we can handle a siege situation
8277918 i guess none of us could have foreseen his own chief of staff assassinating him and hammond
8277919 dead along with four sgc personnel who must have been trust operatives
8277920 and theres no guarantee they all crawled out of the woodwork during the attack
8277921 we need to get some intel on whats happening out there
8277922 all frequencies are being jammed so theres nothing coming in and we cant get a signal out
8277923 thirty six military mainly support staff and sg teams on stand down since the ori came calling and i estimate around forty seven scientists between here and level 21
8277924 heres the plan i want us to get all the supplies we can carry from both the infirmary and kitchens and then i want any labs and offices stripped for laptops and whatever else those scientists think we might need then well fall back to this level
8277925 we should be able to hold levels 21 to 28 for several weeks
8277926 well be lucky if we have a few hours before they break through this has been planned carefully
8277927 colonel caldwell this is dr mckay we need help down here
8277928 dr mckay im aware of your situation but were a little busy up here right now the trust has sabotaged the ship weapons transporters and engines are offline prometheus is in worse shape in truth we could do with your expertise up here doctor
8277929 colonel caldwell this is colonel sheppard code sigma tau alpha six three seven
8277930 we dont know who else might be listening in and until we can guarantee a secure line then the less said the better
8277931 fireball that swept through the lower levels of stargate command is known to have collapsed several key levels military rescue teams have arrived at the scene and are moving slowly through the wreckage it has been confirmed that president landry was killed in the initial explosion along with elite members of his staff vice president robert kinsey has expressed his horror at this calamitous event
8277932 leaving going where theres no safe place left on earth
8277933 i need you to gather up every piece of equipment we can transport offworld
8277934 we cant go out there the ori have already taken over three quarters of the galaxy wed be sitting ducks
8277935 we dont exactly have a choice mckay if we stay here then the only person who might walk away from here alive is you and i doubt youd remain you for very long
8277936 we feed all the power from the national grid into the stargate dial atlantis and go all of us in one shot all i need is access to the power grid on level 25
8277937 we know from the other sam that our universes diverged three years ago when hayes declassified the stargate program and let the world know about the goauld and the ori therefore we know atlantis is still there at the bottom of an alien sea in the pegasus galaxy we know the earth gate is the only gate in this galaxy that can link to the city we have the address and we know well have to conserve power until i can get the city to rise to the surface or we bring back a zpm
8277938 i thought the city rose on its own once the shields
8277939 not in our timeline we didnt go to atlantis three years ago and we wont be taking elizabeth weir with us and frankly im not too keen on the drowning thing in this timeline in the hope that someone else will go back in time and persuade janus to save our asses in yet another timeline
8277940 sam told me how to raise the city you have to trust me
8277941 i figure we have less than two hours before the trust break through
8277942 novak i have a change in priorities i need the asgard transporter and the hyperdrive online as quickly as you can
8277943 about time lets lock this place up tight and get out of here
8277944 theyve breached level 21 falling back towards the gate room
8277945 lorne you have to hold them as long as possible and give our people time to get through the gate
8277946 you could say that lock onto my signal and transport on three
8277947 colonel we have transporters and estimate another ten minutes until we have the hyperdrive back online
8277948 sergeant stackhouse sir i have a message from colonel sheppard
8277949 were going to atlantis colonel sheppard wants you to head for pcz 439 and pick up any stragglers before joining us
8277950 put us in geosynchronous orbit over area 51 novak prepare to transport personnel and please use full scans to avoid bringing any parasites on board
8277951 sir all priority personnel have been transported secondary tier personnel are being targeted now
8277952 cooper once secondary targets have been transported head to the outpost in antarctica
8277953 lock onto colonel oneills stasis chamber and transport then open a channel to the ancient outpost
8277954 colonel chekov this is colonel steven caldwell of the daedalus i dont believe i need to explain whats happening a goauld fleet is heading towards earth and the ori wont be far behind you have twenty seconds to decide if youre staying on earth or coming with us
8277955 colonel caldwell this is colonel chekov yes we are aware of the situation we thank you for your offer of assistance and are ready to transport immediately
8277956 sir prometheus reports all personnel transported on board a courier has been transported across to the prometheus with the first of the rendezvous coordinates
8277957 tell prometheus well see them at the rendezvous point wait until they enter hyperspace and then follow
8277958 hyperspace windows are opening above the earth the goauld fleet has arrived sir
8277959 sealing off level 25 theyre right behind us but the seals are holding them up for several minutes each time
8277960 we lost henderson and garvey markham and two others are wounded im sending them down to join the back of the queue
8277961 keep moving the wounded down markham a few of the medics are at the back of the queue and can fix them up until theyre through the gate
8277962 colonel none of that equipment is essential and the stargate could shut down at any moment i suggest you forget the schoolboy heroics and get out of there now
8277963 power ratio dropping to minimal sustainable level in twelve minutes
8277964 generators are in place awaiting connection kavanagh says he can
8277965 no tell kavanagh to get everyone back to the gate room and get ready to punch in that gate address for the second city if this doesnt work
8277966 strip the wires two inches on red three on blue
8277967 no i just thought id bring the other four generators down here to keep the first one company yes of course all of them
8277968 well lets see how snippy you get when youve got less than six minutes to total shield collapse
8277969 and the water comes pouring in here and we all drown
8277970 im serious colonel this room will be underwater in less than three minutes and its going to take me that long to complete the connections
8277971 then youll need someone to make sure your tools dont float off
8277972 lets get him out of this damp area lift on three one two three
8277973 were on the surface sir he raised the whole damn city the scientists are assessing the damage now
8277974 people are going to be tired and hungry pretty soon i want you to take some of your men and scope out the closest rooms that can be used for temporary sleeping quarters get them cleaned up and prepped people are going to have to accept a little overcrowding until we can sort out something better
8277975 to set up a mess hall he should know what to do
8277976 not broken but the doc wants me to take it easy for a few days
8277977 for what its worth you made the right decision bringing us here
8277978 who can we use on the civilian side to get these people on their feet while mckay is out of it
8277979 grodins already got a few of the civilians checking through equipment making an inventory another nudge in the right direction and hell have the rest of them on their feet
8277980 okay ill leave it to you to give him that nudge
8277981 you really need to be removing those wet clothes before you catch your death of pneumonia
8277982 i just thought id check on our star patient first and give him back these
8277983 the extra passengers are stressing many of our systems to their limits
8277984 so most repairs are proceeding as expected slowly we need to offload most of those passengers as soon as possible and give the air time to recycle through the ship
8277985 better still we need to land and open up all the doors and windows
8277986 sending coordinates for the final jump well see if we can find you a good landing spot good luck daedalus out
8277987 a scan of the surface shows an area in the south of the continent that can support the weight of both ships the airs a little cleaner there too with far lower levels of sulfur and carbon dioxides
8277988 colonel chekov wishes to speak with you at your earliest convenience
8277989 colonel caldwell i am familiar with both ancient and asgard technologies i offer my assistance as we are all now in same boat
8277990 yes of course but blueprints of asgard hyperdrive and shields are same as korolev yes
8277991 i was an engineer in charge of readying her for that final battle
8277992 im grateful for the offer doctor but we have the situation under control on board the daedalus however the prometheus is in far worse shape and therell be at least a hundred people on board who are relying on that ship for a ride to safety
8277993 then i must go where i am needed so if you would please excuse me
8277994 even if the prometheus was fully operational we have too many refugees for the journey ahead some of them are going to have to stay behind and await a second trip
8277995 here on this desolate world with no natural food and water
8277996 daedalus can take three hundred drop them off at the first world we encounter with a stargate and then head back for the rest
8277997 then i will set up a refugee camp and coordinate supplies and rationing while the commander of the prometheus effects repairs to his ship with the help of dr zelenka
8277998 but if you do not return within twenty three days
8277999 then i do not know what we will do for there is no place left in this galaxy that is safe
8278000 major take us in as close to the prometheus as you can
8278001 colonel you have two hours before the daedalus heads out
8278002 you drowned rodney and the colonel cracked a couple of ribs bringing you back
8278003 you ready to see our city or are you just going to lie there all day
8278004 i i apparently i have you to thank for undrowning me
8278005 um did anyone check if the planet surface was um safe from radiation
8278006 no we thought wed just come out here and die a different horrible death after nearly drowning
8278007 kavanagh checked out the zpm chamber and he says the zpm is now fully depleted i guess that means were gonna have to find another one as soon as we can
8278008 well were not gonna steal a zpm from a bunch of kids and if colonel carter was right then atlantis hasnt got more than half a dozen drones left to protect itself whereas
8278009 a nearly depleted zpm if not fully depleted by now depending on whether theyve had to fight off the wraith during these past three years
8278010 well we have a little time to plan how were gonna wrestle that zpm and the drones away from the people in the tower
8278011 if sams recall was as good as she claimed then all wed have to do is sneak in and take what we want except
8278012 except she mentioned a certain amount of erh instability within the structure
8278013 look the other city has been exposed to the elements for ten thousand years so its hardly surprising that its falling to pieces
8278014 we probably shouldnt eat anything in case its been poisoned
8278015 right ill bear that in mind in case we get invited to dinner while were stealing their drones ships and zpm
8278016 then youll just have to see if youre as clever as that alternate universe mckay and find us the brotherhoods zpm
8278017 you need to rest and lorne has already scoped out some quarters you can use
8278018 major carter named it its a ship that goes through the gate
8278019 ease up a little dont hold the controls so tight youre gonna snap them off
8278020 atlantis takes control once you come in range of the city so no you dont have to worry about any fiery collisions
8278021 its a ship that goes through the gate hence gateship
8278022 that little thing isnt a ship its a shuttle a jumper im gonna claim this one and call it puddlejumper
8278023 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8278024 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8278025 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8278026 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8278057 i know how lucky ive been to come into the st helens team at the right time since i broke into the first team we seem to be winning all these trophies so i know im a lucky lad
8278058 ill wait for my time knowing keiron hell probably end up doing another year hes not showing any signs of stopping
8278059 i am feeling good and im in good form so id like to think i can go round again
8278060 i dont really like missing games but every now and again you need to rest the bumps and bruises and it helps mentally
8278061 ive great memories of wembley last year and ill be going out to try and emulate it
8278062 last year was brilliant from a personal point of view people keep going on about me scoring the first try
8278063 i know everyone thinks that these are big games but we need to look at it like it isnt
8278064 if people go in thinking its this game and its that game then they try and do something special that might not come off you need to do what youve done to get to the final
8278065 its my first experience of wembley and ill be like a little kid in a chocolate factory when we have a look around on friday as its always nice to go and play at these big stadiums
8278066 but well get that out of the way on friday and then get ready its the highlight of the year and after the way we started the year you wouldnt think that wed be in a challenge cup final so im certainly ready to play
8278067 im happy to do whatever is best for the team
8278068 thats what being part of a team is all about its the team first and then me second its been a bad season for us with injuries but thats just part of football and it doesnt bother me
8278069 thats part of rugby league and youve just got to get on with it this years been really bad with injuries and stuff but thats just the way that it goes sometimes
8278070 you cant help it when people get injured and as part of a team you have to find a way around these adversities
8278071 but if you look through history its the teams that keep their key combinations together for the longest periods of time that are the most successful
8278072 i played against him for brisbane against st helens and he was great then hes been around a long time and is a great player and it will be a good challenge
8278073 hopefully they are due for a loss though after 20 wins in a row you cant keep winning forever and that might work in our favour
8278074 theyre a quality team with some quality players in their key positions so well definitely have our hands full
8278075 itd be nice to end my first year on a high though as ive really enjoyed my time here
8278076 i know everyone thinks we should have another baby they are all on my side hon
8278077 i guess i guess if you really want another one we can
8278078 well you do realize your brother also pumped me full of jager and i will deny this entire conversation in the morning
8278079 so if we can make a baby tonight we can have another heh

8278095 we just have these problems that are becoming a nuisance
8278096 employees are afraid to show up to work because they have homeless sleeping in the doorways its just becoming an obnoxious problem
8278097 its not getting rid of the problem its just sort of pushing it over somewhere else
8278098 maybe they should spend their money more effectively and sponsor a homeless shelter on the eastside

8278105 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8278106 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8278107 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8278108 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8278109 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8278110 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8278111 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8278112 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8278113 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8278114 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8278115 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8278116 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8278117 vamos a ganar si o si ser a un fracaso no estar en champion este a o
8278118 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8278119 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8278120 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8278121 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8278122 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8278123 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8278124 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8278125 who are open to doing something on the production side
8278126 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8278127 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8278128 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8278129 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8278130 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8278131 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8278132 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8278133 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8278134 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8278135 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8278136 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8278137 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8278138 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8278139 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8278140 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8278141 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8278142 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions
8278143 the police had called at my house that morning before i left for work asking whether i knew where jill and chris were whether they were on holiday but they gave no indication what had happened
8278144 when i asked they said thered been a bit of damage done at the house and they needed to contact them the officers seemed quite jolly and upbeat but at the same time i was uneasy it was in the back of my mind all day and i kept trying jills number
8278145 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are
8278146 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8278147 they loved that house they moved there about four or five years ago and although it needed a lot doing to it they fell in love with the place
8278148 chris got in contractors and completely overhauled the place it was like a mini mansion he put in a lake and was in the process of putting in another hed planted trees and wild flowers and made a wood
8278149 kirsty is horse mad and so is jill theyd filled the place with animals theyd got sheep horses dogs ducks guinea pigs special breeds of chickens jill even had an incubator and hatched out some duck eggs herself this year
8278150 for chriss 50th birthday this year she got him three sheep as his present thats how they were
8278151 despite the occasion we had an enjoyable time together i went back to the house afterwards and spent a couple of hours with them we walked round the grounds together
8278152 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing a search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe

8278180 the cruise offered the unique opportunity for residents to bond with one another they came from different backgrounds and different communities across the u s but the residents share a common interest in epcon communities and the advantages of community lifestyle

8278182 we cannot accept these violations of all international law of agreements on security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country
8278183 it russia is an international outlaw that is not just the opinion of the european union
8278184 its all very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia in particular crimea ukraine and moldova
8278185 ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics
8278186 but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government russia also cannot stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors so it purposely created tension in the region
8278187 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8278188 any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8278189 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict
8278190 we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base
8278191 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8278192 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8278193 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8278194 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8278195 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8278196 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8278197 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8278198 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8278199 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8278200 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8278201 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8278202 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8278203 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8278204 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8278205 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8278206 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8278207 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8278208 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8278209 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8278210 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8278211 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8278212 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8278213 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8278214 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8278215 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8278216 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8278217 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8278227 consistent with the strategy we have articulated the acquisitions of sofrasar and gergen represent important steps in the geographic expansion of our oem supply business in europe through the addition of numerous important customers primarily in france and germany we have added another key building block that will drive future organic growth in this important global end market
8278228 in addition to being immediately accretive to earnings we anticipate that these acquisitions will add 10 to 12 cents to diluted earnings per share during our first full year of ownership
8278229 when combined with our existing oem supply businesses in europe we anticipate annual revenues of approximately 800 million in this market over the next year the addition of these businesses will significantly enhance our oem supply business in europe and add considerable depth to our footprint in the area as we will now be serving customers in 11 countries throughout the continent

8278320 the first people to have migrated out of africa to modern day middle east and mediterranean did so 100 000 years ago the first people to reach the bering straight in modern east russia got there 18 000 years ago and crossed over to north america
8278321 they are thought to be ancestors of native american indians the early ancestors of the inuit are believed to have crossed the bering straight 10 000 years ago migrating from the area currently known as mongolia
8278322 it seems unfathomable to think all the worlds people simply went about roaming the earth ceaselessly yet the logistics of such a migration offer a realistic perspective the circumference of the earth is approximately 40 000 kilometers about 25 000 miles if we take a conservative estimate of 80 000 years of migration the people pushing eastward out of africa would have had to move only half a kilometer a year to cover the distance of the earth in a straight line

8278361 der grund daf r ist in zwei aspekten zu suchen
8278362 wer sich auf eigene kosten impfen l sst muss mit kosten in h he von etwa 450 euro rechnen
8278363 die viren werden durch geschlechtsverkehr bertragen und haben eine inkubationszeit von zehn bis 15 jahren
8278364 der erste liegt bei etwa 30 jahren also entsprechend zehn bis 15 jahren nach dem ersten geschlechtsverkehr
8278365 der grund daf r kann sein dass die ehe gescheitert der partner gestorben ist oder die frau einfach in eine midlifecrises kommt
8278366 wir k nnen noch nicht sagen wie hoch die prozentuale heilungsquote ist sind uns aber sicher dass die impfung sinnvoll und n tzlich ist
8278367 wir glauben da wurde ein hoch riskanter test auf den markt gebracht der nicht ausreichend klinisch getestet wurde und der die gesundheit der bev lkerung gef hrden k nnte
8278368 leider gibt es bisher noch immer keinen zuverl ssigen test gegen eierstockkrebs

8278371 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8278372 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need
8278373 we do not need another prozac but we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8278374 are finding it harder to compete against larger players for many reasons including the need for economies of scale and greater investments in expensive technologies and tools to comply with laws
8278375 very clearly this industry is going to continue to undergo consolidation
8278376 its tough for smaller plans to be able to make the investments to keep up with
8278377 i think pressure continues on those that didnt merge at that point
8278378 that there will be some more of those that have remained independent merging or getting swallowed up in one way or another
8278379 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8278380 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8278381 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8278382 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions

8278400 what will be extraordinary about this will be the impacts it will achieve in terms of traffic congestion relief economic development and jobs and the obvious environmental impacts it will have
8278401 this reflects a view that if you have money you get to go in the fast lane and if you dont you are stuck in congestion
8278402 the overall goal of the program is to improve the movement of everybody in the corridor
8278403 in other parts of the country where this has been tried there has been a significant difference in congestion
8278404 people are always asking me to explain it to them and there really is no good way to do that

8278422 o time estava errando muito no posicionamento t tico no primeiro tempo t nhamos colocado para eles que precis vamos encaixar a marca o mas tomamos o gol e entramos em p nico
8278423 no segundo tempo voltamos melhor e eles conseguiram mostrar uma outra postura acho que merecemos o resultado
8278424 quando fui contratado o mano me falou que eu seria segundo volante ele viu algumas partidas minhas nessa posi o e gostou mas independentemente da posi o quero jogar para ajudar o corinthians

8278448 we would have been doing a disservice to the people we were honoring they were the ones that encouraged us to explore and discover new ways of treating music new perspectives thats what it was all about to follow their lead to take the very pieces they were associated with and put our own spin on it
8278449 we all felt a responsibility to those we were honoring and to music in general
8278450 we wanted to convey what miles and trane were all about reaching beyond what you know and exploring the territory you dont know
8278451 we went into this with a sense of discovery trying to find a way to shed some light on songs we identified with miles and trane
8278452 they each created music that reflected the time they lived in and by doing so created music that was timeless we wanted to find a way that would reflect our sensibilities and the times we live in
8278453 john and brian added so much to the mix a very high level of creativity and imagination combined with complete virtuosity
8278454 and then there is their incredible enthusiasm they made every night an adventure
8278455 this was the first time i ever toured with michael or herbie
8278456 i always get nervous around herbie because hes such a big star hes crossed so many boundaries you know the first time i played with him i was so nervous i could hardly play
8278457 i was really pleased by roys ability to rise to the occasion im accustomed to hearing roy play in settings that are more traditional harmonically and melodically it was a challenge for all of us and roy jumped in like he was born in it
8278458 i thought it was a composition that echoes coltrane and miles while also being a fun vehicle to blow on
8278459 when i was with miles wed usually have a rehearsal where everyone would bring their compositions but for one rehearsal nobody had anything to present
8278460 its very different from the original yet it still has that thread of miles in it from my association with him when i was in my twenties
8278461 i was thinking of the miles davis quintet from the 1960s when they started getting into a sound that was beyond regular structure
8278462 it was along in that vein i wrote the song and gave it to herbie to reharmonize and it became a whole different thing
8278463 we wondered if we could make it into a verve release because it was one of our better concerts and it really represented what the tour was about that great vibe from that old recording was still in the house
8278464 their western aggression barbarism and state sponsored terrorism not only in palestine iraq and afghanistan but also in bosnia and various south american countries have surpassed all records known to human history
8278465 t he de facto power in these nations pakistan and saudi arabia are political islamic movements this makes these leaders ineffective in stopping these nations from being fountainheads of terror
8278466 even in those days aggressive jihads were waged because it was truly commendable for establishing the grandeur of the religion of allah
8278467 jihad insurgency or whatever you want to call it in kashmir yes pakistan may have helped the jihad at some time but it was not started by us
8278468 all assistance to the people of kashmir and support its steadfast struggle
8278469 90 percent of the funding for kashmir militants is from other countries and islamic organizations like the wamy
8278470 spectacular growth after 1982 lay in the support it gained from islamists in west asia notably the kuwait based world association of muslim youth and the saudi arabia funded international islamic federation of student organizations
8278471 s ubsidizing pakistans terrorism training infrastructure and isi terrorist operations by a whole host of islamic fundamentalist terrorist outfits against india
8278472 funds are available for the asking for let not only from pakistan but also from wahhabi fundamentalists in saudi arabia and the uae
8278473 unlike the truth and reconciliation commission model we are using homegrown models for reconciliation because of the nature of the conflict which was hate built
8278474 there is a tendency after conflict to expect solutions to come from outside creating dependency and a lack of sustainability
8278475 they are put in a setting where they survivors and perpetrators live together as the conflict was based on stereotypes
8278476 when people are in ingando they can go for umuganda for trust building
8278477 it is a civic duty to participate in umuganda to ensure that all participate in reconciliation and development
8278478 you have a million perpetrators to be tried who then have to live with the victims this is not easy
8278479 most perpetrators are poor the elite planned but manipulated the ordinary masses
8278480 if you want to have sustainable peace you have to make sure you have an equitable society
8278481 there is also a need to rewrite history so that its teaching is not manipulative but rather serves as a lesson
8278482 those continuing to perpetrate these crimes need to be punished
8278483 initiatives to bring justice are currently in place but more needs to be done
8278484 sometimes we need evidence and those providing it are threatened some judges have also been killed
8278485 there are some extremists in society who still have genocide ideology
8278486 it is a difficult task measuring the progress of reconciliation
8278487 however the fact that people are able to co exist in mixed settlements is encouraging
8278488 we meet and see them the perpetrators around at least they accepted their mistakes and we forgave them
8278489 as a strongly practicing christian though i believe people need to face the law for their crimes i do not believe in a system that puts criminal punishment first but one that emphasizes education to prevent any such crimes
8278490 my understanding is that our society needs so much to do with education aimed at changing behaviour other than doing that with criminal punishment
8278491 i would like to see the current youths supported with vigorous programs such that they can graduate from associations into cooperatives
8278492 my preference is that the electoral commission should have been given the mandate to avail some funding support to candidates especially the independents because we do not have resources like political parties but if there is nothing they can provide i will operate with what i have
8278493 as the situation stands now however it is becoming very difficult for me to raise all that money but ultimately the people of rwanda are going to vote for me amass considering how they have come to know me from different fora
8278494 so much has been done by government and the outgoing parliament
8278495 and that is where i want to continue from but with more vigour and new ideas
8278496 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8278497 our country made a commitment to eliminate leprosy nationally by the end of 2007 today we consider it done
8278498 even if leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem efforts to reduce its prevalence in the province should still continue
8278499 it could last six days six weeks i doubt six months
8278500 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8278501 when youre working with someone on a regular basis and you say to them well you go and fly and do some circuits now and they dont come back its absolutely devastating
8278502 the main task for mrs clinton at the convention reaffirming her support for mr obama in soaring and unconditional language dominated her 23 minute speech and she betrayed none of the anger and disappointment that she still feels
8278503 while mrs clinton is in the midst of a catharsis friends say mr clinton remains angrier than people realize about the obama campaigns portrayal of his wife as deceitful and of his administration as middling and his political tactics as at times racially charged friends have been urging mr clinton who speaks on wednesday night to move on and counseling the couple to focus their energy and emotions on mr mccain
8278504 at times clintons address sounded like an acceptance speech as she recalled her own historic quest for the white house and the many people she met on the campaign trail and hoped to help as president
8278505 i think a lot of the volume is up just because its tougher for people to make their dollars stretch
8278506 charlemos he o do decir que los vuelos parecen menos largos si uno habla con la persona que tiene al lado

8278509 it provides insurgents with limited options to move around freely
8278510 weve also been able to use the illumination rounds for seeking out caches by finding tire tracks in the desert
8278511 we have to maintain artillery presence to show that were still here
8278512 there has been suspected insurgent activity in the areas were illuminating and its good to catch them in the act

8278516 i am a believer in knowing what your doing when yopu apply for a job
8278517 wrong but delightful a response to v venkatesan by rajeev dhavan 1 what a wonderfully provocative review 2 the main debate is on whether the parliamentary debates were fulfilling see book pp 34 5 clearly they were not 3 it is the obc bench that was utterly confused about whether the creamy layer applied to scs and sts see book pp 227 233 where the contradiction is shown 4 the important aspect of nagraj and coelho is the caveat that 50 reservations creamy layer and compelling necessity are essential in respect of future actions even validity of the constitutional amendments is upheld see book pp 238 5 alas you have reviewed only the epilogue see book pp 199 ff and my supposed reversal of roles but not the book 6 i love your writing right or wrong
8278518 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8278519 the principle is similar to the virtual shoe fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris
8278520 but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t shirts shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about
8278521 to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously
8278522 calculating the spatial parameters of the projected image on the basis of a two dimensional model this reduces the number of dimensions we need to simulate the image and allows us to rapidly evaluate any movements
8278523 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
8278524 the 2007 levels already disappointing because they are worse than those for the 2001 recession are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years this suggests that significant pain may lie ahead for many americans
8278525 we advocate for a shift in tax incentives for health insurance so lower income americans get money to purchase coverage
8278526 we also want insurance market reforms to provide individuals more choices and ensure coverage for high risk patients
8278527 the numbers of uninsured parents and children are likely to grow as employers lay off more workers and states consider cuts in their medicaid programs to help balance their budgets during the economic slowdown
8278528 you know that we dont panic here you hit the panic button it just gets worse right right
8278529 its not like ice skating where you know what routine is going to come its always going to be something different every game hopefully we can keep finding different ways to win
8278530 that was a spot where one pitch could turn the game around it was the best scenario for us one pitch got two outs
8278531 now i am able to fight with inflation in this changing world by work from home secrets of adsenselov
8278532 help every child live up to his or her god given potential and of course get the troops out of iraq but about the man himself she was silent
8278533 i like the man i like obama hes a family guy hes just like us etc it is about
8278534 i didnt think barack was qualified to be president before and i still dont now i think i would be a better president and i deeply resent that he didnt even consider me for vice president given that i won at least nearly as many primary votes as him and possibly even more
8278535 for the last time it isnt up to hillary to unite the party and heal its divisions its up to the standard bearer so far hes failed his surrogates at least in calling clintons appeal racist are calling those 18 million largely working class voters of hers bigots so far he hasnt done much to heal the divisions and bring them in
8278536 mashed or sliced avocados are packed with more than 20 vitamins minerals and 60 percent more potassium than bananas
8278537 more and more parents are complaining when their children suffer even minor injuries
8278538 parents need to accept that a part of growing up is that theres a bit of rough and tumble in life accidents happen
8278539 obviously if serious accidents happen and there is negligence involved then its legitimate to complain its legitimate to make a claim
8278540 i think we have become a very over legislated society where there is little room to move to initiate your own ideas because there are just so many rules and regulations
8278541 what will kids have left to do i think its fine if im looking after dakoda but she can play by herself when shes older and its ok for kids to play those games if theres teachers around
8278542 kids need to have a few bumps and knocks to learn become resilient to learn to cope with setbacks so it is possible to mollycoddle kids in a way that actually depowers children
8278543 to have a world where children arent allowed to climb arent allowed to jump arent allowed to skip and do cartwheels i think is far too restrictive
8278544 i unwrapped my work and they looked at it and told me it was inappropriate and they would not hang it in the exhibition
8278545 they said that school children would be seeing the exhibition
8278546 staff rightly so rejected the pieces based on their graphic nudity
8278547 en una jerarqu a todo empleado tiende a ascender hasta su nivel de incompetencia
8278548 the strain of such a change of pace and the closeness of the score for three quarters it was only 17 15 at the half one of their players actually sat on the floor during the early part of the game that kind of stressed the idea of a real slow down but their coach got him back on his feet in a hurry the best memory was stepping up to receive the box holding the gold medal along with the small bunch of flowers
8278549 i just told him that the report that was out was inaccurate
8278550 that i hadnt talked to chris mortensen and i was unaware of anybody that had it was not coming from us or at least people on our staff or ones i was aware of having been through situations like this before i wanted him to understand that that was not my feelings or that was not what was going on with that report

8278554 while pressure on the business due to disruptions in the direct channel from the systems upgrade could be viewed as temporary the company faces too many headwinds in the near term for us to get interested in the stock at the current valuation

8278561 believe me im not happy about paying 3 80 for a gallon of gasoline and i know youre not either
8278562 i concur with that view and believe current fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy
8278563 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate

8278655 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
8278656 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants

8278906 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in

8278933 das war ein fantastisches wochenende und wie ich schon sagte war es auch ein perfektes wochenende ich hatte kein einziges problem
8278934 das lag vor allem an der arbeit die wir zuvor mit unseren simulationsprogrammen geleistet haben
8278935 aber wenn es nur darum geht das layout zu lernen hilft der simulator weiter und ist ein wichtiges werkzeug denn so hatten wir zumindest schon vorher eine ahnung von dem was uns erwarten wird
8278936 die strecke sah auf dem papier viel besser aus als im richtigen leben auf dem papier schien sie wirklich interessant zu sein aber im rennen gab es nicht so viele berholman ver wie man h tte erwarten k nnen
8278937 sie ist besser als viele andere strecken so viel steht fest
8278938 die strecke sah auf dem papier viel besser aus als im richtigen leben
8278939 ich habe diesmal eine recht aggressive rennstrategie gew hlt da ich ein sehr konkurrenzf higes auto hatte
8278940 wenn man eine solche strategie w hlt und sich nicht sicher ist ob man die pole position holen kann k nnte man schwierigkeiten bekommen denn die strategie kann gegen einen arbeiten wenn man im qualifying den n tigen startplatz nicht erreicht wenn du ein schnelles auto hast musst du wirklich alles tun um die pole zu holen da das die beste ausgangslage f r das rennen ist
8278941 wenn du ein schnelles auto hast musst du wirklich alles tun um die pole zu holen
8278942 nach kimis motorschaden der nat rlich f r entt uschung gesorgt hat habe ich mir um meinen eigenen motor nicht allzu gro e sorgen gemacht

8278946 alles was ich dazu sagen kann ist dass ich weiter siegen will und weiter nicht nur meinen teamkollegen schlagen will sondern alle anderen auch solche entscheidungen liegen nicht in meiner hand ich versuche einfach den besten job f r das team zu machen und berlasse den rest dem teammanagement
8278947 das leben wird in den n chsten wochen ganz sch n anstrengend und aufregend sein

8279034 staff are being pushed to the limits it is a bottleneck it is a shambles and it is only going to get worse
8279035 we havent been able to get a private patient into a private hospital for weeks theyre full too
8279036 im not sure suspending elective surgery for a week would be enough it might take two
8279037 what i do expect is hospital management to make decisions on a daily basis about what is in the best interests of providing safe patient care
8279038 if that means theyve got to temporarily suspend elective surgery then unfortunately if that decision is made in the interests of patient safety i support that i would rather that not be the case but thats the reality of the very busy times we are experiencing at the moment

8279047 now some decades have now passed and i think its time the broader australian taxpayer got a return on all that
8279048 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8279049 we definitely need a carve out period the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8279050 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8279051 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8279052 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8279053 they might see the us dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8279054 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game

8279102 a club in europe wanted ajibade and they offered 20 000 around 13 500 i felt that was an insult to enyimba
8279103 last season ajibade got five million naira around 28 500 as sign on fees
8279104 i think it is all wrong and i hope our players do not continue to belittle themselves with this craze for europe
8279105 a manchester united player does not just leave camp two weeks before a champions league match against ac milan to go on trials at barcelona so why should our case be different
8279106 we always release our players but we will not derail our ambitions because we want to let our players off to europe
8279107 we will eventually not be able to hold on to them but i always tell them to be careful and not be in too much of a hurry to leave for europe
8279108 we looked organised in the first half but it all went out of the window in the second half we lost our shape and discipline and our goalkeeper matt duke kept us in it
8279109 as a collective the team was far too disorganised and dishevelled in the second half and we lost the game
8279110 it was a cup tie tonight and the shoe was on the other foot for us but we didnt wear it well
8279111 it is a set up here that is built for the next level and i wish them well
8279112 i thought the quality was fantastic especially in the second half hull showed why they are a premier league side in the first half we probably gave them too much respect and we paid the price by conceding a goal

8279152 we knew he had a chance to be a very good end for us
8279153 they had two really good ends in kansas city of course then they lost jared allen i dont think at the time they thought they were going to lose him so we snatched wilkerson up and we got us a pretty good football player
8279154 there is obviously going to be a blackout sometime this season unless the chefs give their tickets away which will just anger everyone else who is getting ripped off in the stadium jay feeley is was our biggest offseason pickup and we are 35 million under the cap i guess we couldnt afford to keep jared allen though sheesh its going to be a looong season fire the power and hire bill cowher
8279155 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8279156 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8279157 she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding
8279158 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8279159 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8279160 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage
8279161 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8279162 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8279163 those are the reasons i ran for president these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8279164 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8279165 she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding
8279166 she did everything she needed to do to unify the party
8279167 she made it very clear from the beginning that the way she was going to continue fighting for what she believed in and what she was passionate about was by fighting for sen obama
8279168 she made it very clear to all of us who worked for her that she expected other people to do the same
8279169 right from the get go she embraced barack the obama people got exactly what they wanted and what they needed
8279170 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8279171 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8279172 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8279173 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8279174 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8279175 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8279176 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8279177 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8279178 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8279179 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8279180 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8279181 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8279182 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8279202 i am a divorced mother i cant have a drink
8279203 it is a personal opinion of the chief minister it is not our partys stand
8279204 the chief minister has not said the right thing he will be asked for a clarification for his public remarks the matter will also be raised in the politburo meeting
8279205 we have not discussed the issue yet we have to see what he has said exactly and in what context
8279206 personally i dont support strikes bandhs shutdowns do not help the country
8279207 unfortunately i belong to a political party they call strikes and i keep mum
8279208 bhattacharjee would not have said so if he did he is wrong
8279209 calling for bandh is the very legitimate right of a political party it is always used sparingly
8279210 it is his personal view he has expressed a political party and a trade union cannot give up the right of workers to go for strikes it does help the working class and in many places strikes have made the management adhere to the demands of workers
8279211 it was a test of their character and they have come out on top their achievement is significant and highly appreciable
8279212 there is a huge talent in boxing here indian boxers are as good as any in the world technique wise they are second to none what they need is more facilities and opportunities to fight at the highest level
8279213 the best thing about the boxers is that they compete to win they are capable of beating the best in the world
8279214 there is some structure allright but thats not enough if the boxers have to realise their full potential injuries are not taken seriously because of the lack of awareness what they do not realise is that minor injuries could become career threatening
8279215 there has to be a corporate government synergy and the common objective should be to help athletes perform better there should be a coordinated effort
8279216 he was adamant on getting back into the ring and that gave him the inner strength to recover faster
8279217 he is fighting fit now thanks to the tremendous backing he received from the mittal champions trust if akhil is able to maintain his present level of fitness he can surely go on to win a medal at the london 2012 olympics he will never lose a bout for want of effort
8279218 this gathering is not to declare a state of confrontation but to end social conflict and division

8279220 we are introducing this system to minimize complaints of wrong billing faulty distribution of bills and to avoid standing in queues for submitting the bill amount
8279221 its been a highly satisfactory day for me my best moments came on the 12th and the sixth holes while on the par five 12th my nine iron approach shot left me a four feet putt for eagle on the par three sixth my six iron tee shot landed just three feet short of the pin
8279222 a lot depends on putting on this course and one needs to make maximum greens in regulation to stay in contention
8279223 i think my best effort today included the approach shot on the 12th which set up a six feet putt for eagle and a chip in for birdie from the front edge of the 17th green
8279224 eleven workers were killed in the incident on tuesday and 10 of them have been identified as indians
8279225 the other victim we have been told was a bangladeshi most of the indians who died hailed from karimnagar district in andhra pradesh
8279226 the roof of the villa where the bachelors lived collapsed and aggravated the situation
8279227 we cordoned off the area soon after the fire erupted and all the people from the neighbouring villa complex were evacuated immediately
8279228 the building had 30 rooms and approximately 500 men were housed in the complex illegally with some 20 people sleeping in one room alone
8279229 the house where the fire broke out had partitions and the police is waiting for a dubai municipality report to confirm whether the partitions were authorised
8279230 there were also additional electricity meters installed in the house we need to check if they were authorised
8279231 the tenure of the appointment of justice a k mathur as chairperson in the armed forces tribunal will be for a period of four years from the date of assumption of the charge of post or till he attains the age of 70 years whichever is earlier
8279232 it is a comprehensive study of supreme court judgments in death penalty cases during 1950 2006
8279233 ironically a peaceful country like india preferred to remain with the minority countries during the united nations voting on moratorium on the death penalty in december 2007 150 countries supported this issue but india was not sure on its stand
8279234 mahatma gandhi was also in favour of abolishing the provision of death penalty
8279235 there is a detailed analysis of around 700 supreme court judgments on death penalty cases in the report the authors of this report have exposed a judicial system that has failed to meet international laws and standards relating to the death penalty
8279236 indian penal code ipc needs an immediate overhauling as it itself acknowledges the fact that there can be a discrepancy in a courts order so we cannot take it granted and need to amend it death can never be a solution for any ailment
8279237 just like european union countries india should abolish death penalty many times the decisions are also not balanced even in the case of martyr bhagat singh the decision of death penalty was based on judiciarys vested interests they did not even listen to the accounts of eye witnesses
8279238 the finance ministry is introducing yet another anomaly by lowering the extant of parities of officers of the armed forces of the lt col and equivalent by retaining them in pay band 3 while raising similarly placed civilian and paramilitary officers to pay band 4
8279239 it is reliably learnt that civilian and paramilitary officers in the extant pay scales s 24 rs 14 300 400 18 300 and s 25 rs 15 100 400 18 300 will be placed in pay band 4 whereas the same is being denied to the armed forces officers lt col and equivalent who were already in s 25
8279240 this is not just affecting a lt col because of this the pay of coast guards commandant with 23 years of experience will be equivalent to a rear admiral with 30 years of experience
8279241 the taking of a territory by the army of a neighbouring country
8279242 the registration act 1908 provides for registration of deeds and documents but not registration of titles ownership the titles to property are merely presumptive this leads to a lot fraudulent land dealing
8279243 once introduced an ownership guarantee certificate will be provided and none other than the owner can possess it
8279244 the system will be of great benefit to people as land records will be always up to date tamperproof and easily accessible since they will be placed on website with proper security codes
8279245 the time taken for obtaining copies of land records will be drastically reduced automatic and automated mutilations will reduce the scope of fraudulent property deals and also litigation
8279246 fernandez has done a great job for indian boxers his term has ended we will recommend his name to sports authority of india for another tenure he was with the team for all the pre olympics tournaments where the boxers shaped up for the beijing games

8279258 the finance minister assured us that the reserve bank of india rbi and the national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard will look into the matter
8279259 the banks have requested the government to pay interests arising out of the delay in releasing funds for the loan waiver scheme

8279337 no one around here will do it after 12 weeks
8279338 with what others here and there have reported more and more women seem to be self inducing abortion or at least attempting to
8279339 while many may believe that the landmark 1973 roe v wade supreme court decision that overturned laws restricting abortion put an end to improvised abortions the medical community worries there still may be a problem
8279340 now advocacy groups ibis reproductive health are launching a study in san francisco new york and boston to find out how many women go outside the normal clinic abortions and why
8279341 ive seen a real increase in the blogs and the chatter in the herb chat rooms about this lately
8279342 the most common way is that women take herbs that are poisonous and take enough to poison the baby but not themselves
8279343 this is not easy to do unless the woman is sick enough to be throwing up and in serious pain its not going to work
8279344 frankly im not surprised they cant argue on the merits
8279345 is not remotely surprising these are the guys who wont report on john edwards
8279346 if they werent having an impact they would be ignoring them
8279347 they have a sisyphean task in moving a boulder up the hill to say that secret ballots wont be eliminated by the efca
8279348 go to their leadership and say i saw what they did in minnesota i want to rethink this
8279349 an underlying shift is occurring in american attitudes regarding the international role and priorities of the united states voters across the party spectrum understand that americas reputation has faltered and believe this is a problem for the nation that needs attention and repair
8279350 both dependence on foreign oil and strengthening the global economy have skyrocketed displacing terrorism at the top of voters international concerns
8279351 to advance these and other issues our research shows that americans overwhelmingly support policies that promote a balance of military strength and diplomacy and to prioritize international cooperation instead of going it alone to advance our interests
8279352 royal caribbean is thrilled that aaa travel is providing us a forum to make another momentous announcement for oasis of the seas

8279356 they can pretty much do what they want with the gas prices in this town because a lot of people dont leave town so theyve got to pay for the gas prices
8279357 its ridiculous how much higher prices are in certain areas
8279358 when i travel to henrietta and to wholesale clubs the price drops about 40 cents a gallon
8279359 one of the underlying contributors to the high gas prices especially in upstate new york is that the oil companies know that through zone pricing they can target certain areas where people are more apt to pay higher prices for gasoline
8279360 they basically squeeze as much money out of the market in geographical locations as they possibly can
8279361 they figure its more affluent out here in the suburbs and that they be willing to pay more

8279367 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity

8279384 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet
8279385 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
8279386 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
8279387 roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
8279388 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet
8279389 through asphalt the researchers are developing a solar collector that could turn roads and parking lots into ubiquitous and inexpensive sources of electricity and hot water
8279390 the simplest and biggest contribution anyone can make to leaving a habitable planet for our grandchildren
8279391 a casual attitude toward global warming ought to be viewed as a sin
8279392 we just think deciding how big a family to have should take into consideration our descendants
8279393 although corn was relatively cheap during the early phases of the u s ethanol boom rising commodity and food prices have placed increased urgency on the development of cellulosic or second generation ethanol
8279394 harnessing the natural and abundant power of the sun and cost effectively converting it into energy is an important component of our comprehensive strategy to commercialize and deploy advanced clean alternative technologies to enhance our energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
8279395 our investment in these grid integration projects will lay the groundwork for high levels of solar photovoltaic market penetration to help meet the presidents goal of making solar power cost competitive with conventional sources of electricity
8279396 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8279397 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8279398 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8279399 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8279400 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8279401 to go through a two hour operation i would say is a little bit extreme for a publicity stunt
8279402 to say no you cant do this or this is publicity is absolutely crazy at this stage when we havent even looked at it
8279403 this has not been done on a human before so for someone to say this is not going to tell us much we dont know
8279404 we really dont know but we want to find out what sort of signals we are going to get and what sort of signals we can put in
8279405 what were doing is historic and momentous it is going to change the world
8279406 science fiction has predicted this for quite some time as a scientist im excited about taking a step into the future
8279407 but as a human i do share the ethical concerns about what it will mean for humanity
8279408 for someone like christopher reeve it might not bring back complex movement but if it could allow him to control a bit of technology to pick up a cup it would be enormously useful
8279409 slip sliding away slip sliding away the more you reach your destination the more your slip sliding away
8279410 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8279411 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
8279412 investigations are ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of our secure locations
8279413 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8279414 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8279415 routine base operations will continue through the day as normal assuming conditions warrant this while emergency preparations continue
8279416 once i can make calls using the wi fi network i will in all likelihood reduce the monthly minutes i have with at amp t
8279417 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8279418 once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system
8279419 airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations
8279420 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8279421 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
8279422 i think one day ill be able to meet him and michelle i just dont think its going to be this week
8279423 chevy chase and his wife also stopped by the jet party saying they were attending obamas thursday speech
8279424 this song is a pointed attack at people who call themselves christians but act anything far from it
8279425 dear supporters if you vote for sen john mccain for president you are an idiot do you really think its worth being mad about barack obama beating me so we can have four more years of the last eight years and further screw up the country
8279426 some actions taken while the account was offline could not be completed
8279427 i sent a message in apple mail and a new copy of it keeps poping up in my on my mac folder under my sent mail folders every 10 15 seconds i also get an error message that says mail has undone actions on some messages so that you can redo the actions while online mail has saved other messages in mailbox on my mac so that you can complete the actions while online
8279428 were excited to have stephen on board he brings an incredible amount of industry expertise and his energy and passion for the business is contagious stephens refreshing approach challenges the status quo we look forward to his contributions as we continue to launch new services and enhancements
8279429 i like pushing outside the space to find much needed solutions thats why i look forward to working with whypark their innovative domain building system is absolutely essential for todays domain investors ive wanted for years to find an inexpensive solution to build out my domains with relevant index friendly content when i saw that whyparks system does this easily and with little expense i was hooked
8279430 a well known insider within the domain industry mr nunez is an excellent addition to the sedo team his extensive global expertise will help sedo to enhance its leadership position and expand the companys product offerings
8279431 i look forward to helping sedo strengthen its market position in the global domain name marketplace sedo will continue to leverage its tremendous success with online auctions as it extends other services such as live auctions globally
8279432 i never sat down with that in mind ive just got to take it on the chin yknow i am dusty springfield and yes i made a 60s record
8279433 im just eating so i can get a little work done while im feeding my face that way i can get even more done in the day
8279434 so i could work at eat lunch at the same time
8279435 putin in georgia iran and iraq wish it was me instead of barack
8279436 my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8279437 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion
8279438 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8279439 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8279440 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses
8279441 we talk of people being at risk of obesity instead of talking about who eat too much and take too little exercise
8279442 when it comes to providing clear and accurate nutritional information to help consumers make healthy food choices the traffic light system is too simplistic
8279443 once again the tories offer lots of warm words but with very little policy substance
8279444 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8279445 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8279446 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8279447 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8279448 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8279449 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8279450 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8279451 at aston villa it was difficult at end of last season and this season when he wasnt playing
8279452 i saw him play on saturday when he played for 70 minutes and i thought he was outstanding he looked lively and bright
8279453 i spoke to shaun and he feels with a couple of games under his belt that he would be back to 100 per cent so i had no hesitation in bringing him back into the squad
8279454 he has started the season well and he gives us a different dimension and he is in good goalscoring form so that is why we brought him back in
8279455 alan has progressed in the last few years as a top class international full back some people would say one of the best full backs in britain
8279456 so it is very disappointing but we were aware of his injury pre season we kept our fingers crossed that he might be available for the start of the campaign
8279457 unfortunately he is not and at this moment in time it is still difficult to know when he is going to be exactly fit but he is certainly going to be missing our first two games
8279458 graham alexander is experienced which is very important in the world cup
8279459 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8279460 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8279461 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8279462 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8279463 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8279464 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8279465 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8279466 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8279467 obama and biden will meet with voters to discuss americas economic challenges and the obama biden blueprint for change
8279468 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8279469 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8279470 determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it or should be dismissed without prejudice the absent person s being this regarded as indispensable
8279471 good value for money good running costs but not without its faults
8279472 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8279473 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8279474 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8279475 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8279476 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8279477 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8279478 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8279479 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8279480 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8279481 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8279482 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8279483 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8279484 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8279485 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8279486 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8279487 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8279488 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8279489 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8279490 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8279491 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8279492 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8279493 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8279494 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8279495 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8279496 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti
8279497 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8279498 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8279499 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8279500 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia

8279512 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8279513 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8279514 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8279515 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8279516 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8279517 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8279520 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8279521 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8279522 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8279524 quando sono state appiccate le fiamme i bambini non si trovavano nelledificio solo la donna si trovava in una delle due camere incendiate ed rimasta ustionata nel tentativo di scappare
8279525 la suora era in un centro pastorale nel distretto di kandhamal quando stata aggredita e picchiata
8279526 the grocery business is highly competitive and we frequently refine our promotions based on the market
8279527 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8279528 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8279529 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8279530 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8279531 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8279532 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8279533 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8279534 you dont have to worry about plastic bottles you dont have to worry about anything leaching into your water
8279535 youre probably spending less money on a lunch kit than you would buying plastic bags every two or three weeks
8279536 these companies that are invested in the eco world want these products to last longer than just a season thats the whole idea
8279537 initially you might invest more but youre going to have it for longer and when you divide it out over the years that you have it youre paying less in the end
8279538 this is really a time of the year where theres such a tremendous amount of shopping thats done to help kids get ready for school and to be perfectly honest im sure that a lot of it is not really necessary
8279539 and consuming of product and buying things and disposing of things unnecessarily really is a significant environmental problem
8279540 these are little things that dont seem all that significant but when you add them all up and you multiply them by large factors of people that are active in doing these kinds of things it really does translate into some significant environmental benefit
8279541 the city dump often has a really nice clean facility where they sell things and you can drop off your used goods that youre not using any longer
8279542 taking your kids out to places like that is a really good learning adventure
8279543 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8279544 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8279545 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8279546 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8279547 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8279548 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8279549 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8279550 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8279551 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8279552 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8279553 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8279554 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8279555 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8279556 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8279557 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8279558 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8279559 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8279560 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8279561 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8279562 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8279563 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8279564 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8279565 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8279566 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8279567 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8279568 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8279569 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8279570 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8279571 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8279572 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8279573 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8279574 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8279575 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8279576 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8279577 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8279578 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8279579 she is an outstanding young lady who will be able to contribute to this team in many ways she was a talented infielder at appalachian state and is very knowledgeable relative to skills and strategies i expect her to be specifically involved with the infield outfield and hitters although i intend to use her in every phase of the game her personality and character blend in perfectly with this program and staff
8279580 i remember it all oh how well i remember the feeling of hitting the bottom but theres on e other thing i remember and remembering i keep a grip on hope
8279581 weve got a variety of growth stages from the northern part of the state to the south
8279582 in north alabama we had a lot of beans double cropped behind wheat and in many cases the late spring planting conditions were either too wet or too dry some of the beans went in later than wed like to see
8279583 many growers planted whatever they could get i think well be close to the nass estimate of 330 000 acres but the seed shortage might have had some sort of impact
8279584 soybeans will help spread our workload in the fall and the risks arent as great as with other crops
8279585 were coming off two bad years in a row here probably the worst years weve seen so the good prices and the low inputs brought us back to soybeans
8279586 at the time we were growing them behind wheat this year we just planted them no till in fields where a very poor cotton crop had been last year the price got up to around 12 per bushel and i thought that was pretty good so i booked about 25 bushels per acre now im kicking myself and hoping i can make 50 bushels and make a little money
8279587 whatever we grew or made last year depended on irrigation it took turning it on and leaving it on and this was even before the cost of fuel and fertilizer really took off soybeans looked attractive last year and they looked better and better as the year wore on
8279588 we planted straight into the old cotton row pattern on 38 inch rows i wish we were still on 30 inch rows they worked much better for us because they shaded more quickly especially the group iv beans this years crop had me worried in the beginning because we werent getting much rain but we finally starting catching some showers and theyve bushed out nicely
8279589 with most of our varieties in the mid group v range we should be harvesting soybeans at the end of september or early october i hope that timing works out so well be finished with corn thats why i didnt go with an earlier group iv bean it probably would have interfered with cutting corn
8279590 we had a lot of alfalfa hoppers and grasshoppers so i sprayed some brigade and put out some borosol at about the r1 stage once we starting catching some rainfall we began applying some fungicide at about the r4 stage with the rain showers conditions have turned more favorable for a disease complex its worth the money and it makes you sleep better
8279591 its a definite concern you just try to keep up with the diseases movement on the internet and you keep in close contact with your consultant to find out what theyre hearing soybean rust is probably one of the biggest fears to growing soybeans we have plenty of good products and the price is up to a point to where we can justify spraying soybeans now but the disease has the potential to come in and wipe you out its a scary situation
8279592 we just cant take the risk of growing dryland corn especially now with fertilizer prices being what they are it would have to be soybeans or peanuts but you need extra equipment for peanuts its a much slower harvest and the peanuts come off when the cotton is ready if the price stays at about 12 per bushel you could even justify watering soybeans especially when following wheat
8279593 the disease could have been dormant over the last month and became active when a cold front passed through kentucky about 10 days ago
8279594 were heading into a warming period clear sunny weather and warm temperatures in the daytime which is unfavorable for blue mold
8279595 its still cool enough at night that in places where its active its likely to stay active its just that it wont pick up and move very far as long as its clear and sunny during the daytime
8279596 the pathogen needs an actively growing host to infect and produce spores
8279597 once farmers top the tobacco and spray to control suckers it pretty much shuts the plant down physiologically you get some leaf maturity but you dont get the active growth so those plants tend to be a lot less susceptible
8279598 if theyve topped their crop and applied their sucker control material theres really not much they need to do
8279599 but if you have susceptible crop in the field you need to be looking for it if youre in the right kind of environment you can still get some pretty good spread inside a field and it may be worth considering applying a fungicide if the crop is far enough away from being topped and cut
8279600 continued dry weather is starting to hurt pastures and later planted crops
8279601 dry conditions continue throughout the county late season soybeans are in danger cutting of corn for silage is well under way pasture conditions continue to deteriorate late dry weather has helped vineyards and orchards
8279602 early apple varieties are being harvested frederick county had zero inches of rainfall this week
8279603 dry weather continues to grip the southern and eastern portions of the county corn that was planted early is nearing silage maturity silage harvest has already begun on many farms late corn is really suffering in the dry areas of the county rain at this point will probably not help any of the corn in the area pastures and hay fields are also desperate for rain and many farmers have been feeding hay for two weeks already
8279604 the lack of rain is beginning to affect the soybean crop storms predicted for next few days if they are widespread and of an inch or more immediate threat to soybean crop will be alleviated but timely and significant rains will still be needed corn crop is about done early corn harvest should start in a week or so yields will be off significantly in some areas due to lack of rain but close to average in areas where thunderstorms hit the price of inputs is of great concern for fall and next years crops some farmers are not contracting and being very cautious because they cannot price inputs for next crops tomato harvest is still going on farmers are scouting soybean fields and finding worms like the corn earworm but at threshold levels below the need to spray so far if dry weather continues it could be a major problem
8279605 lack of widespread rains is taking a toll on soybean yield potential pasture and hay production the soybean crop is in a critical stage right now and rain is needed very soon to avoid very significant yield loss producers spent the week scouting soybeans for corn earworm attending field days and getting equipment ready for harvest earworm pressure has been spotty with some acreage being treated as economic thresholds were reached some early corn was harvested during the week with yields of 70 to 140 bushels per acre reported
8279606 pastures that were improving a month ago are gone hay is being fed and with last years hay shortage beef herds have already started downsizing the prolonged drought is again creating water shortage concerns as springs are failing corn will start entering the silo this week barring substantial rain
8279607 the county is relying on scattered thunderstorms for moisture the second cutting of hay is very short with many weeds due to dry conditions
8279608 dry conditions continue in appomattox county corn silage harvest continues at a rapid pace due to lower than usual yields corn is drying down rapidly early planted soybeans are dropping leaves and the first harvest may take place this week dark tobacco still looks good but mainly due to irrigation water is becoming an issue for some cattle producers producers now pricing winter feed are becoming very concerned and many are downsizing their herds to match hay and feed on hand
8279609 moisture conditions have been critical for soybeans for a couple of weeks
8279610 severe drought conditions are setting in cattle are beginning to be fed with hay the county is seeking drought declaration
8279611 corn silage harvest is under way and some hay is being cut and harvested very dry conditions no material rainfall for the month of august soybean production is in doubt due to the dry conditions
8279612 charlotte county has adopted a resolution requesting a drought disaster designation at the request of the extension service
8279613 moisture conditions have worsened rapidly since the beginning of august the tobacco crop is in need of moisture to improve curing conditions and mature later plantings crop progress remains two to three weeks behind normal producers are exhausting or have exhausted their irrigation water soybeans are in dire need of moisture to salvage some yield with no prospects of moisture in the forecast soybean yields will most likely be well below last year corn silage is drying down faster than harvest is progressing
8279614 this was the first cool wet spring weve had to deal with in five or six years
8279615 it brought home the idea that if youre not using a seed treatment on your soybeans you need to be its just a matter of time before you may get bit without one
8279616 looking at a seed treatment containing cruiser researchers found that seed treatments produced a positive economic return more often than now when soybeans were selling for less than 7 a bushel
8279617 with wheat beans were still developing a data set but we think growers should use a seed treatment
8279618 for may 1 or earlier plantings i would put it on every seed ive never heard a grower say he wished he hadnt used a seed treatment
8279619 we use the same philosophy with replanted soybean seed that we use for the first planted seed do not plant soybean seed without a fungicide seed treatment our common seedling diseases such as pythium are just as active in warm moist soils as they are in cool moist soils pythium as well as other common seedling disease causing agents can be just as devastating on replanted soybeans planted in late may as on early planted soybeans spending less than 3 an acre on a fungicide seed treatment is the cheapest and best return on investment of all the crop inputs the last thing we want to do is have to replant soybeans because of losing a stand to seedling disease
8279620 the organism that causes non lethal pythium is the identical pathogen as that which causes full blown pythium
8279621 non lethal pythium can result in infected plants that often do not grow normally or contribute to final yield
8279622 infected plants are often characterized by the lack of unifoliate leaves and trifoliate leaves growing directly from the cotyledon region
8279623 these trifoliate leaves often are the beginning of multiple stems typical of a plant that has lost its apical dominance i e the same appearance as crazy cotton

8279699 their legitimacy and influence are strong within urban and rural areas and also reach to grassroots levels a factor which differentiates them from the majority of other civil society organizations
8279700 the civic movement always differentiated between the ending of the war and peace in many respects one of the greatest strengths of the angolan peace movement is that it effectively understood peace as the creation of an equitable and just society

8279852 snow ok senator there is talk of a constitutional amendment to define marriage if in fact the courts do not support the previous act the defense of marriage act would you support a constitutional amendment biden no and the reason is tony this is going to be an incredibly difficult thing for america to grapple with and were going to go through a process here that is necessary for this nation in terms of how we deal with the rights and the recognition of gay unions and i dont think that gets settled by a constitutional amendment it makes it more divisive but one of the things i think more americans are trying to figure is whether or not somehow a gay union is a threat to a heterosexual union and i find difficulty in figuring how its such a threat if in fact it brings stability if in fact you have two women who decide to stay with one another for 35 years and are sound and solid in terms of their commitment to one another i dont know why we should be frightened of that but you know there are long cultural and moral overtones in some religions and churches about this and its going to be something we have to go through as part of the maturation process of the nation i just keep thinking what would happen if one of my children had been gay i dont know that id love him any more or think that they need any or theyre entitled to any fewer rights than any other american

8279854 richard foster is doing a good job at right back and the defence looks fairly solid but i can understand jimmy being keen to bring in alan
8279855 it would allow richard to play elsewhere whereas alan is a natural right back who knows the game and his job
8279856 i think it would be better if the player shows a bit of commitment
8279857 i can understand him wanting to wait until the last minute to get the best deal he can but it would mean so much more to jimmy if he would come out and say he enjoyed it here last season and he wanted to come back and do his bit for aberdeen
8279858 if would be good to see that attitude because things might happen with other players who are showing commitment
8279859 things have dragged on and jimmy does not like that
8279860 the players involved polish football and the national team have all lost because of this
8279861 i dont want to share the details of the events of that night because i dont want to destroy a players career and it would do that
8279862 there are different versions and a lot of speculation and i do have to defend my players
8279863 however boundaries were made clear right at the beginning and thats why i had to suspend three players
8279864 they are professionals and must behave like that they have to learn to take responsibility and learn from the mistakes they make everyone knows what the rules are
8279865 it was a very difficult decision to drop them one of the hardest ive ever taken

8279867 it still hurts to think about what i am doing but i have no option
8279868 it was a ridiculous decision its beyond me the way the fourth official reacted
8279869 there was no swearing or anything id been sitting on a towel and i threw it to the floor because i was so disgusted nothing else
8279870 the referee didnt speak to me he didnt ask to see me so i take it the matter is closed and nothing will happen because nothing should happen
8279871 if it does i will fight it because i did nothing wrong it was absolutely ridiculous
8279872 we had enough chances to win five games no question about that we played well created so many chances which is great but once again i must point the finger at the boys who did not capitalise
8279873 that has to be corrected whether through a change in personnel or by somehow getting the boys even sharper in those situations
8279874 when you are one on one with the goalkeeper so many times you must score simple as that
8279875 that seems unheard of yet we need to make an effort to include prayer and scripture more when we meet as a church council

8279960 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
