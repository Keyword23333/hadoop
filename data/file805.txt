8050000 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8050001 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8050002 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8050003 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
8050004 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
8050005 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
8050006 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
8050007 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
8050008 nous avons un conseil dadministration demain mercredi et je crois savoir quil y aura la pr sentation dun projet d conomies de 100 millions deuros pour la sncf

8050018 i couldnt believe it but when i got down there i knew it was my cat because they all have their own voice
8050019 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8050020 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care

8050023 were seeing improvements overall in hydrologic conditions but we are approaching the end of the rainy season in september
8050024 we still have much more room for the water resources to recover
8050025 as todays presentation illustrates even as we approach the end of the rainy season were still not where we need to be and its sobering
8050026 i just hope that the public doesnt think that were out of the woods but instead its still a serious situation and we still need to be diligent about it
8050027 final analysis of the data for this discovery was done by a thoroughly international team of researchers including scientists of american belgian british georgian italian and russian nationalities they worked closely and productively together to achieve this challenging and exciting experimental result
8050028 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as post traumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders

8050033 its to savour the olympics that im taking part with pui pui
8050034 to be here and to take part in these outdoor events and to meet so many dogs and people makes pui pui very happy

8050036 all the neighbours are playing in afghanistan but who is suffering the most
8050037 the oic forces should replace the nato forces in afghanistan even us statistics show that only 8 percent success could be achieved in the wars against terrorism through the use of force during the last 40 years
8050038 is going to be a new pervez musharraf with all the powers in his hands the us is also happy that it will have to deal with only one man

8050053 our rationale is that we dont want customers to get in a situation where they cant afford their outstanding commitment
8050054 the largest banks are trying to limit their exposure to housing in general

8050063 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8050064 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change

8050068 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8050069 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8050070 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8050071 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know
8050072 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8050073 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8050074 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8050075 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8050076 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8050077 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8050078 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8050079 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8050080 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8050081 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture
8050082 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8050083 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8050084 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8050085 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8050086 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8050087 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8050088 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8050089 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8050090 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8050091 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8050102 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8050103 this will result in the exchange of information between ourselves and the officials in abu dhabi
8050104 we believe it is beneficial to have our officers embedded with law enforcement authorities there
8050105 the planning the organization the capacity to rally the troops and sustain support over all those months despite our own defectors a toady and hostile press and our resolute opponents seems to me still a kind of miracle after more than 20 years collective action seems possible again
8050106 besides the gains in reuse for the internet and in writing for the internet what the guild achieved was an internal momentum that we must not surrender
8050107 we must remain organized we must remain vocal and we must remain focused on the major issues
8050108 early on in the strike we talked a lot about the pr war and who was winning it us or them
8050109 it took three months but i finally got it our employers dont care about their pr let alone basic fairness they are willing to spend whatever it takes to keep writers hands out of the new media pie and those actors better not try to make a grab for a bit more either
8050110 it is sadly enough an object lesson that what we fought for remains very much in play and that the fight is not over
8050111 i picketed and stood in the rain and leafleted for myself and for all our futures i became a strike captain because i wanted to help more
8050112 the struggle to preserve and extend our very hard earned benefits is harder than ever
8050113 but winning that battle is not impossible our successful strike showed what can be accomplished by solidarity and a smart militancy

8050121 a s far as the internet making us meaner it does remove a natural censor that we have that commands us to treat people with common respect an exception apparently are the people posting on this board whose intelligence humility and wit are extremely frustrating in that theyre disproving my point and that drives me nuts
8050122 the malays were not influenced by the swearing and sodomy issues that umno had tried to capitalise on and they punished bn
8050123 the quran swearing episode by mohd saiful bukhari azlan was seen by many malays as a conspiracy by umno most do not believe in the sodomy allegations

8050139 an opportunity like this does not come every day when i was offered this project i agreed to do it in a heart beat
8050140 i am so excited to have been given the opportunity to sing this is me from camp rock because this song is a reflection of me as an artiste
8050141 the theme in the movie is all about finding your voice and i feel that i have finally found mine since winning oiam nearly two years ago
8050142 i loved the lyrics it talks about achieving dreams and it feels real because it seems to tell my story
8050143 but the best part is even when it was translated to bahasa malaysia it didnt lose its meaning
8050144 i received the script for the music video two days before the shoot i had to learn the various facial expressions fast the production crew taught me well
8050145 i am no actor i am just a girl who loves music but at the end of the day the music video turned out great so yes i am satisfied
8050146 i was touched by the lyrics of the song which encourages you to believe in yourself express yourself and follow your dreams
8050147 it will have additional features like an opening scene with guitar driven songs which i have written and composed to be performed by the cast
8050148 it will end with a preview of a sequel called the bloodsisters which is coming soon
8050149 part two takes the audience on a journey to understand the history of the bloodihood and why the bond is so important to sean michelle and nichol
8050150 the story will grow emotionally in the eyes of the audience this time it shows nichols attempts in vain to patch the rift between sean and michelle
8050151 the price of gold is getting lower by the day now and we have always had the intention to reward our loyal customers in the best way we can which is why we come up with the event whats more despite the low market price of gold weve taken a step further by lowering the price by another rm7

8050153 the director has added many new characters and side plots the supernatural and fantasy are emphasised instead of horror which was the focus in the past
8050154 my character transforms from a selfish person to one who discovers what it means to love in fact this applies to all the characters who express love differently
8050155 all that he does for her amounts to nothing in a desperate move to win her love he acquires more power than her to force her to love him but to no avail
8050156 we thank all our fans in malaysia and asean we had a great time and made a whole new bunch of friends
8050157 our trainers and advisers especially azmeer pushed us hard to come this far wed like to dedicate this victory to them
8050158 the group clearly showed us it was the crowd favourite for the evening together with the other four finalists it has set high standards of performance for its successors
8050159 a high number of wrong time errors is not surprising and given the lack of clinical significance of the errors observed is probably not a meaningful indicator of quality
8050160 made to order is a service that allows variations on selected items from our permanent collection that includes bags and trunks whereby customers can personalise their items with a different material for the exterior and a dissimilar lining to make the item their own
8050161 custom made orders on the other hand are items which fully test the mettle of our craftsmen these are unique one offs the products of our customers wild imaginations

8050163 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8050164 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8050165 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8050166 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8050167 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
8050168 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8050169 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8050170 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8050171 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8050172 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8050173 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8050174 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8050175 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8050176 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8050177 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8050178 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8050179 it has been an honor and a privilege to wear the clemson track uniform
8050180 i want to thank clemson university and the athletic department for being so supportive in helping me to achieve my goals inside the classroom and on the track ive had nothing but great experiences at clemson the coaching staff my teammates and the people in general have given me a lifetime full of great memories i also believe that my future as a professional athlete is very bright im still young and i believe that i have the potential to be the worlds fastest man
8050181 die hard 4 0 is as good if not at times better than the first film
8050182 i have this crazy conspiracy theory apple started psystar bare with me for a second
8050183 physicians donated time and forgone profits amount to 7 8 billion after government payments to hospitals are subtracted private philanthropy and profit margins are responsible for at least an additional 6 3 billion
8050184 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
8050185 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
8050186 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system
8050187 you know you cant control your supporters thats one thing about politics but she has done everything humanly possible to support him
8050188 theres a lot going on and you hear a lot of talk and a lot of people really are afraid of whats going to happen tonight
8050189 a lot of the people that i am with and run with are supporters of hers and they still are and theyve been having a lot of meetings
8050190 the clinton folks that are around here and pat branum from chattanooga is one of them are excited about voting for her on the first round and then excited about jumping up and supporting obama
8050191 i think actually going through this and recognizing her and having this process is absolutely critical to doing it
8050192 the average new zealander has a boat has a caravan they have families where they travel to the beach theyre not going to get out of a big car and get into a toyota or a mitsubishi lancer to save money
8050193 im finding the demand all right but if the price of cars goes up obviously its going to affect my business
8050194 i think once a v8 driver always a v8 driver and four cylinder car drivers theyll stick to four cylinder
8050195 whatever the cost it doesnt worry them too much they may come down from a v8 to a v6
8050196 softened more or less putting it back on the industry
8050197 its tough enough to build a niche community as it is if you have to compete against a giant like amazon its 100 times tougher
8050198 whether shelfari goes mainstream will depend on how amazon integrates it with its core business and with products such as the e reader kindle
8050199 we are thrilled that the jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the market place and not in the courtroom
8050200 as soon as they leave normal school they go on the two year course and at the end work for franchise dealerships and vehicle manufacturers the team and the school is sponsored by all the car manufacturers in japan
8050201 they were here last year and back in 1996 theyve also travelled around japan and to australia
8050202 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners

8050204 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
8050205 could i just mention to you jay in a moment of seriousness
8050206 that i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table
8050207 the artisan series basically gives users everything but the kitchen sink in terms of features and performance

8050214 we wanted to pull it back a little because we felt three years ago was our best event and had 1200 at that last years lost a bit of the exclusive feel and the romance around it this will keep it feeling special
8050215 we had it on sale for four weeks early bird at 155 and then 14 extra to get food so its 169
8050216 my pay is set by the remuneration authority and there is a pool of money left that is divided up among the councillors
8050217 running into the elections last year we probably took a bit of a hit then post election there were some disagreements on council and the city is very sensitive to any kind of bickering or squabbling as has happened in the past
8050218 i think effectively that its his judgment that chief executives are paid quite well and what he gets is enough i really respect that
8050219 this wasnt some sort of public statement i think he just felt he was being paid enough
8050220 we think hes done a very good job of course not everything can go right and at the speed you want but were happy with the progress

8050233 just as cnn com is where people go to find out whats happening in their world their communities and their lives cnnpolitics com is where people go online to find out whats happening in politics
8050234 we agree that you dont grow an economy by raising taxes we agree that you dont grow an economy by cutting off trade we agree that you dont grow an economy by saying were not going to drill of additional oil
8050235 if you go back and look at debates held youll find each of us describing our differences with one another and surely youll find where one or another of us disagreed with sen mccain on one issue or another
8050236 but youre never going to find someone saying john mccain wasnt qualified to be president of the united states
8050237 his experience has not provided for him the kind of judgment gravitas that is necessary to face the kind of challenges of world at large
8050238 i think he brings experience but if you look at joe bidens record with some 30 years in foreign policy experience theres about 30 years of generally being wrong on foreign policy issues
8050239 the thing that i want to hear first is that she is satisfied on behalf of us and those who sent us that the platform reflects her policy priorities if that has been improved since she campaigned then that would be a good message
8050240 remind people of why barack obama is much better than john mccain for anyone who supported her
8050241 shes going to have to help people remember what the elections about it wasnt about hillary it was about policies
8050242 i will be president and im going to let everybody have their say
8050243 unlike obama hillary clinton does not attempt to engage in mind control
8050244 uh ahem um oh did you leave me a message ha ha i havent checked my messages in the past couple of days when did you call
8050245 la bater a de lars suena fatal la letra no me llama la atenci n y del ritmo mejor no hablar
8050246 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8050247 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8050248 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8050249 i have applied for the position and well just see what happens
8050250 itd be a huge honour if i get the opportunity i have an extensive cv and have coached all around the world
8050251 i would really enjoy the challenge and i think i have the skills to move the team forward
8050252 we have taken the opportunity to assemble a team of emerging talent and players who will benefit from the experience of touring and playing in australia and india
8050253 the tour is helping to build the experience of these players and is part of a programme to build greater depth at international level
8050254 weve got one of the oldest cars in the field but this is a key rally for us due to being a young competitor and being at home
8050255 richards been helping us quite a bit with setting up the car and driving tips
8050256 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
8050257 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
8050258 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
8050259 it was tricky because the waves were crashing over his head one minute you saw him the next he was under a metre of water his fists were white from clinging on
8050260 if no one had been there he would have given up he was pretty gouged up from the rocks his feet were opened up
8050261 he is a very with a capital v lucky man
8050262 it was quite a long flight and we are pretty tired but this is an amazing reception
8050263 i am just so excited and relieved i never imagined the drama fortunately
8050264 i am the proudest mother in the world i always he knew he was strong and mentally tough but that redefines tough
8050265 i havent seen him for five weeks im very excited
8050266 i think he will be happy to be home i would say he would be disappointed with his performance at the games but thats the life of bmx
8050267 that is at odds with the notion that he should be the person ripping the bark off mccain
8050268 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states

8050275 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8050276 is going to be very helpful in these battleground states
8050277 no i am not going to walk you through it it was a confidential process
8050278 and this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8050279 white blue collar its pumas or clinton someone is always having some grievance and you play the drum beat to bear threads
8050280 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8050281 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8050282 what is clinton thinking and what should she be thinking
8050283 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8050284 this has nothing to do with whats going on now

8050292 at microsoft i learned the truth about activex and com and i got very interested in it inmediately sic
8050293 i will die of something else before i die of aids anything else
8050294 the fight against criminalisation is the fight against hiv aids itself
8050295 will fight actively against criminalisation policy you can count on us
8050296 this is an internal issue i am an ambassador not a lawmaker but i get your point and i will convey your message
8050297 are stunningly wide in their application and fearsome in their effects
8050298 in the abstract and from a distance from social reality there seems a certain justice that criminal penalty should be applied against those who negligently recklessly or deliberately pass on the virus even when there is only a risk of that happening
8050299 we need effective prevention protection against discrimination reduced stigma strong leadership greater access to testing and most importantly treatment
8050300 capacity to negotiate safer sex and to protect them for predatory sexual partners we must change the social circumstances that will empower those women to say no when they wish to and to insist on protection when they want to
8050301 prosecutions and laws single out already vulnerable groups like sex workers men who have sex with men and in european countries black males
8050302 the person who passes on the virus may be more guilty that the person who acquires it
8050303 but criminalisation unfairly and inappropriately places all the blame on the person with hiv
8050304 those laws that target reckless or negligent or inadvertent transmission of hiv only introduce uncertainty into an area that is already difficult to police
8050305 in court we look back with a clinical harshness of the lawyers eye on the complexities of these transactions and i do not believe that it is proper for the law to do so
8050306 that i believe lies behind the enactment of these bad laws those laws seem attractive but they are not prevention or treatment friendly they are hostile to both and this is simply because they add fuel to the fires of stigma prosecutions for hiv transmissions and exposure and the chilling content of the laws themselves reinforce the idea of hiv as a shameful disgraceful unworthy condition requiring isolation and ostracism
8050307 why would a woman in kenya want to go for an hiv test when she knows that it will expose her to seven years in jail
8050308 i want to engage your resolve to practical action today
8050309 let this be the start of a campaign against criminalisation let one of the conference outcomes be a major international pushback against misguided criminal laws and prosecutions
8050310 empowerment will remove any need for the application of criminal law to hiv transmission because there will be no cases deserving of criminal sanction only tragic ones that could and should have been avoided had the right support been in place

8050325 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
8050326 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
8050327 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programs to encourage and support behaviour change

8050331 youve got to start talking about what really makes a difference
8050332 believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned
8050333 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned
8050334 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions
8050335 a fter the event an rnc spokesman reiterated that mccain has been very clear about his position on abortion this campaign cycle and he has he speaks about the life issue at almost every campaign event and his campaign has aggressively courted evangelical voters by highlighting mccains consistent pro life voting record and his stated determination to appoint supreme court justices like samuel alito and john roberts
8050336 id love to see a point where it roe v wade is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe vs wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
8050337 i have always believed in the importance of the repeal of roe vs wade and as president i would work toward its repeal but that must take place in conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce the number of abortions performed in america
8050338 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8050339 theres not an obvious sign that points to a runaway situation but thats not to say its not either

8050355 perhaps this loss in housing equity is why an aarp survey that found increasing numbers of people who are eligible for retirement are instead continuing to work and some of them are even going back to work after retiring
8050356 worse than in your nightmares honey because i am really weird paranoid and stupid hahahaha
8050357 adjusted for inflation investors have lost 20 to 40 of their money
8050358 almost one third of u s homeowners who bought in the last five years now owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth
8050359 negative equity and declining prices are making it difficult for homeowners to sell property for a profit
8050360 now anticipates losing 26 on each loan up from 22
8050361 the fair value of its assets fell to a negative 5 6 billion
8050362 okay ill go get a damned job to get some damned money to buy some damned gold silver and oil if that will finally finally shut you up
8050363 many had counted on the value of their houses to finance retirement but house prices are down as much as 40 in some areas putting a big hole in retirement budgets

8050365 the legal committee of the senate requires dna to investigate stolojan
8050366 dna was soft with the members of pdl who argue with the law
8050367 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8050368 no one knows who i am i live here near nairobi on less than a dollar a month
8050369 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8050370 i was brought up well i live well even now the magazines they exaggerated everything
8050371 we found out the other day that obama and abc news senior national correspondent jake tapper by the way has done some research into obamas family tree and so far hes been able to count eight half siblings of obama one of them was george hussein obama found in a hut in kenya outside nairobi and we found that old george hussein obama living on less than 1 a month
8050372 how come barry cant send his half brother a 20 bill and almost double the guys annual income
8050373 barack obamas lost brother george hussein anyango obama living in a hut in a ramshackle town on the outskirts of nairobi who is literally living there on less than a dollar a month
8050374 even though obama met with him in 2006 you know the guy is suffering and if obama charity doesnt begin at home with obama then i guess weve got to do something about it
8050375 down in texas the gop party now has a brand new web video out they have paid for it and what theyre doing is theyre using some information that they gleaned from the italian vanity fair article that came out toward the end of last week regarding barack obamas half brother who lives on a dollar a month just outside of nairobi
8050376 if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his family first
8050377 im going to talk to vanity fair get george hussein obamas address i will send him the same amount that im sending that family also in africa and ethiopia i will send to george hussein and i will and then and get him out of that shack ill send him less than 500 a year and his standard of living will increase like you have never seen before
8050378 why cant barack pull 20 bucks out of his pocket
8050379 theres the story now afloat that an obama half brother is living in grim poverty in kenya scratching out a bare living on a dollar a month while the senator lives in luxury on 5 million a year
8050380 it seems there are people who want to destroy me and my family
8050381 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
8050382 have you seen john has john mccain commented yet on the homes thing

8050386 if anyone says anything to me about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
8050387 the bottom of the housing downturn is coming into view
8050388 we need to see more of the same kind of reports over the next few months showing increasing affordability and a reduction in inventory
8050389 its therapeutic that these foreclosed properties are being sold off at deep discounts
8050390 theres no question people are getting values today better than they could have dreamed of getting two years ago
8050391 we felt that was the way the market was going
8050392 were starting to see some of things we need to form a bottom in the next six to 12 months
8050393 our scores compared to the rest of the nation speak volumes about the quality of education students in this state are receiving
8050394 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
8050395 when you have 30 frequencies a day are you going to miss one or two come on
8050396 they announced earlier that they were taking away the oakland flight in november
8050397 they announced earlier that they were taking away the oakland flight in november
8050398 i came back for the year and it was just a waste
8050399 its incredible hes back out there he is our leader
8050400 no one has given this kid a chance from the beginning whether it be academic eligibility or just the physical stuff hes had to deal with
8050401 if he had a chance to do it without surgery he is the type of guy if there were one out of five guys that make it hes that one guy because he knows how to put the work in to get it done
8050402 we used all the resources we have to try and keep him conditioned and keep him off that foot
8050403 i think first of all to the football team it tells them how important juan thinks the team is and the game is
8050404 in this day and age thats always something that is in question how much value does something carry to the individual next to you
8050405 people want border security and to have laws enforced but they also understand there are people here working who are probably good for the economy
8050406 in a moment where the average american is suffering in this economic downturn people are always looking for a cause to point to
8050407 were all immigrants no ones saying we dont appreciate people who take time to do it the right way
8050408 faculty have always assessed students in their classes to make sure they know how to do a particular skill but this is the first time were assessing particular outcomes targeted to each program every year college wide
8050409 well test two of the outcomes a year so we can assess all of them over the three years of the college plan
8050410 if the outcomes are negative we can recognize this year that we need to change something next year if we have good results well continue as is and assess two more outcomes
8050411 when you take the whole program youll have been exposed to all of these
8050412 if someone is just dropping in for a personal growth class in trigonometry they wont get data analysis but theyll get all the other four it is accountability over a whole program
8050413 if everyone in a program knows exactly what the students are supposed to learn everything can flow from that to meet your objectives
8050414 the goal is to be able to verify students are learning what we want them to learn regardless of the campus and to make changes if that isnt happening
8050415 total enrollment at pcc which is the sixth largest community college district in the u s is about 75 000 when non credit contract and adult education class enrollment is included

8050418 they say green is the most calming color but i dont think most people around here want to be calm
8050419 tourists can observe the real new yorkers in their daily grind
8050420 no reservation needed free front row seating will be available to broadways sidewalk catwalk fashion show
8050421 someone asked me you actually think people are going to sit in the middle of the street drinking coffee
8050422 a few blocks north at the so called crossroads of the world where on armistice day in 1918 enrico caruso sang from the balcony of the knickerbocker hotel a man was slumped against the gap holding a cardboard sign that read

8050424 this is muhammad ali and this is george foreman that was the rumble in the jungle these are thirty four years old i only wear them on special occasions
8050425 its a terrible sport a brutal sport but its wonderful to write about i remember a guy named lou radzienda a boxing commissioner in chicago i said to him a lot of people think pro boxing should be banned and he said that aint not never gonna happen there are a lot of double negatives but triple negatives are pretty rare
8050426 tickets to games and helmets and footballs and jerseys and trophies
8050427 i have so much shit i have a fifteen hundred square foot gym in my house and its just all over the place in there
8050428 but they were afraid the floor wouldnt hold up so they had to fix it
8050429 ante et post portugal best blog declare the end pr cavaco silva commens on that soon
8050430 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8050431 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8050432 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8050433 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8050434 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8050435 you only had the best of the best taking the test
8050436 i was engaged in a fitful interior struggle i was trying to raise myself to be a black man in america and no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant
8050437 they all asked the same thing of me these grandmothers of mine
8050438 for two centuries the men of my family were raised to go to war as officers in americas armed services
8050439 you are taught to consider their absence not as a deprivation but as an honour
8050440 he was a great admirer of the british empire crediting it with keeping a relative measure of peace in the world for someplace in the neighbourhood of two hundred years

8050446 obama doesnt need big rallies of 25 000 guests we need to find the tepid votes and need to have town meetings with questions and answers with average voters
8050447 white blue collar voters the reagan democrats are not inclined to vote for obama
8050448 voters who are scared about the economy also worry about niche issues like guns social and cultural concerns obama will connect with voters on the important issue of health and health care
8050449 when hillary came into pennsylvania you would have thought it was brad pitt coming to visit in our working class neighborhoods
8050450 obama needs to get out front on this issue during the remaining days of the convention in denver
8050451 it wasnt their finest hour for the media in their coverage of hillary in the primaries

8050477 it was the most perfect time to start a web site about zune and i was one of the first few to create a zune related site
8050478 the way i approached it was that riar was going to be here no matter what
8050479 that was the biggest thing i had to battle with during spring practice no matter how good i did i knew riar could do better hes proved it
8050480 so i planned on the first day of fall camp riars going to be there like he was and i wanted him to play because riars a huge help he knows what hes doing knows his blocking i really wanted him there
8050481 i try to go about it the same just be relaxed and have fun
8050482 but a lot of times if you go with that mentality into blocking you kind of find yourself laying on the ground so for me theres got to be a quick transition from being relaxed and focused for passing plays and then the aggressive side for running plays with our offense you need an on off switch
8050483 coach has really been helping me with my pad level making sure i stay down thats probably the biggest key if youre not low enough youre going to get your butt kicked

8050502 the ball is with st modwen and it could turn around and walk away from this deal or the council could pull the plug if nothing has happened by the end of the year
8050503 if this happens then any development will be postponed and we need to rethink it but i am quite confident even if this deal is off a development will still go ahead but it may be later

8050565 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8050566 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8050567 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8050568 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8050569 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8050570 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment

8050584 we consider this as extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of his holiness the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
8050585 its just time to let this theme go its from another era in our history and its time it had some new life and new meaning
8050586 isaiah and i were back and forth with a few variants of r7 to make sure that 2hadow and yourhead plugins would play nice together under normal use
8050587 this version should do the trick making 2hadow stable enough to be let loose in the open source pool
8050588 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8050589 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8050590 i would argue that towing was never meant to be part of our car free events
8050591 the save fort rock farm circle anticipated the motion to be removed due to standing in todays hearing we remain fully committed to preserving and protecting the environment the fragile ecosystems of the squamscott river the estuaries of great bay and the historic fort rock farm site
8050592 just because a case is so fully and hotly contested by both highly competent counsel and others just because all that occurred it doesnt mean the decision below is unlawful or unreasonable
8050593 it is in exactly these cases where there is full opportunity to be heard full review if they go through the process right and people participate thats what the process requires the process doesnt require any particular decision
8050594 this is the 4th mass shooting of the summer of 08 and it is only by the grace of god that no one has been killed yet as a result it was this latest round which took place on sunday at 2pm in the afternoon which was the most disturbing the block was full of pedestrians and children and the end result was that two elderly women were caught in the crossfire
8050595 how is it that i have no say about what goes in front of my house am i living in a communist new york where the city makes the decision for you i know its the citys sidewalk but once its planted it becomes my responsibility to clean up
8050596 ill stand right here and block them from putting that tree in if i have to
8050597 hockey star alexander ovechkin of the washington capitals and david schwimmer of tvs friends were glad handing at a reception promoting the sochi winter olympics in 2014
8050598 i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8050599 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8050600 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8050601 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part
8050602 this is a small victory in our determined effort to educate both sides of the aisle that there is a true constituency in america that values its internet freedoms
8050603 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8050604 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8050605 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8050606 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8050607 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8050608 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8050609 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8050610 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8050611 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8050612 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8050613 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8050614 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8050615 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8050616 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8050617 should be very engaging entertaining worlds and lead to the discovery of new friendships and relationships
8050618 i see social gaming as a new form of communication that is more interesting than e mail and aim aol instant messenger in terms of connecting people together
8050619 it drives what were doing and informs our decisions we dont want to just stick our finger in the air we want to create a new category
8050620 were investing a lot in ratcheting up the creativity to inspire peoples imaginations to keep people coming back
8050621 the time spent playing is way higher and return users is way higher than any other apps weve done in the past
8050622 shouldnt happen here we shouldnt be putting up with it
8050623 one addict for every two hundred and fifty citizens this not only gives vancouver the highest rate of drug addiction in the western hemisphere
8050624 but means that if the citys rate of addiction continues to increase as at present the crop of addicts now being born will constitute one in every sixteen vancouverites
8050625 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8050626 graffiti can be seen on the walls in shiite districts of baghdad saying iraq for sale see maliki
8050627 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
8050628 if you ask the prime minister what happens if the situation on the ground changes before 2011 then he would obviously say that the dates might need to be changed
8050629 if so what have you done and what will you do to ensure access to it
8050630 was it the perfect law no would we have liked it to ban contraception yes
8050631 access to contraception is the only proven way to reduce unwanted pregnancy rates
8050632 its no wonder that americans on both sides of the abortion debate overwhelmingly support contraception
8050633 definitely not an abortion kills the life of a baby after it has begun
8050634 it is on the abortion issue that the moral bankruptcy of contemporary liberalism is most clearly exposed
8050635 could without much refinement be used to justify the legalization of infanticide
8050636 the same people who wax hysterical at the thought of executing after countless appeals a criminal convicted of some revolting crime would have insisted on his mothers unconditional right to have him killed while he was still innocent
8050637 the same people who organized a boycott of the nestle company for its marketing of infant formula in underdeveloped lands would have approved of the killing of those exploited infants only a few months before
8050638 the same people who talk incessantly of human rights are willing to deny the most helpless and vulnerable of all human beings the most important right of all
8050639 apparently these people do not understand the difference between contraception and abortion
8050640 their arguments defending abortion would be perfectly reasonable if they were talking about contraception when they insist upon reproductive freedom and motherhood by choice they forget that pregnant means being with child a pregnant woman has already reproduced she is already a mother
8050641 black leaders react in traditional knee jerk liberal fashion to issues across the board even though in general black americans are decidedly conservative on a number of issues the black caucus for example advocates a right to abort whereas 62 of blacks oppose abortion national opinion research center 1984
8050642 abortion is a civil rights issue dick gregory and many other blacks view abortion as a type of genocide
8050643 our reaction to scenes of anti abortion activists engaging in civil disobedience outside of clinics is similar to that of many on the left what are they doing using our tactics
8050644 because were a well known brick and mortar outfit people trust us
8050645 and we have infrastructure to get things delivered on time to anywhere in india most smaller companies dont have that
8050646 were not trying to get men to change their behavior
8050647 he is without question qualified to be president of the united states
8050648 we can agree you dont grow the economy by raising taxes
8050649 i have handled many investigations but i cant recall a single other investigation that turned all of our stomachs in which investigators came out of briefings with tears in their eyes
8050650 ronny and marie are involved in the murder and disappearance of rose
8050651 she did something which angered ronny and he struck her on the head
8050652 she slumped her head and ronny thought she was angry at him for hitting her he then realised that the blow had killed her and he panicked he was terrified by the prospect of facing his partner marie so he drove to the yarkon river placed the girls body in a suitcase and dumped it into the water
8050653 we have conducted an extensive search in different places including the yarkon river where for several days we applied different means to locate the body
8050654 but im an american its the best country in the world they call it the land of opportunity and it is
8050655 my mom taught us to suck it up whatever you want to do you can do and thats what i did
8050656 the alleged threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time
8050657 the evidence involving the alleged threats does not warrant federal charges now i must tell you though that the investigation is still ongoing and we are all keeping an open mind
8050658 from a legal standpoint the law recognises a difference between what we call a true threat thats one that can actually be carried out and the record racist rantings of drug abusers
8050659 they were here to do that to assassinate him mr obama
8050660 im hoping the ransom part becomes known to nicky soon i want to see his reaction and i want him and catherine to talk about it she does harbor more then friend like feelings for nick and im hoping theyll reveal their together
8050661 es evidente que esa propuesta est hecha por intelectuales que tienen bellas ideas pero desconocen la realidad por lo que si fuera aprobada tal cual no modificar a nada ni dar a instrumentos a pemex para su modernizaci n sino que al contrario la atar a y amarrar a m s
8050662 ya que en lo que se refiere a las iniciativas es epid rmica y no entra a fondo para modernizar pemex ni da armas ni instrumentos para cumplir los retos que tiene
8050663 se trata de una negociaci n y no del todo o nada
8050664 es indispensable que nos podamos escuchar mutuamente todos para que podamos llegar si no a una propuesta consensuada si a una de mayor a para rescatar a pemex
8050665 el fap y un conjunto de intelectuales hayamos presentado una iniciativa pero no se atreve a hacer un se alamiento concreto porque no puede sustentar sus opiniones
8050666 qu periodista no quiere un acceso as con primero el candidato favorito y despu s el presidente de la rep blica el problema es la pregunta inversa qu presidente no quiere un acceso as con el director de uno de los medios m s influyentes y el otro problema es que entre adolescentes sean precoces puntuales o tard os la amistad y sus lealtades es lo m s importante claro que zileri gran periodista antes que nada no dej de criticar a garc a cuando fue indispensable hacerlo pero aun entonces se sent a la tensi n del amigo forzado a critica a quien te ha dado su amistad y confianza esa amistad le hizo bien a garc a pero no a caretas me imagino que zileri no estar de acuerdo con lo que digo pero en este asunto creo que entre los veteranos de la revista su director est en minor a absoluta pocas cosas tan nobles en la vida como la amistad y la lealtad a ella pero me temo que esa nobleza puede convertirse en peligro cuando se introduce en la relaci n entre la prensa y el poder
8050667 tweaking our schedule to accommodate a lower traffic period and give ourselves some operational flexibility
8050668 if thats the way he wants to race well race him in the chase that way
8050669 okay heres the deal that doesnt mean anything hes raced me that way and thats the reason it went down like that thats it

8050680 se dijo que yo me fui por los grupos pero no fue as
8050681 vos te pens s que yo voy a bajarme de semejante propuesta de lo que es marcelo porque una me dice que el vestido es de vieja o que es estoy en un grupo
8050682 hay otras cosas que yo no estoy dispuesta a hablar yo tengo c digos
8050683 porque por m s que uno diga que uno no toma partido y queda neutra no queda neutra realmente siempre se toma un partido
8050684 there had even been an internal memo about the railings

8050690 sigui al auto policial en bicicleta hasta la estaci n donde los esbirros de la dictadura han llevado a gorki que no se encuentra bien de salud y que se dispon a a hacer un esfuerzo para grabar los temas pendientes
8050691 gorki tiene una inflamaci n en los pulmones y falta de aire y fue sacado de su casa por un polic a que dijo cumplir rdenes del delegado del poder popular un tal jes s y sin orden de arresto en el mejor estilo comunista
8050692 porno para ricardo mantiene su independencia pol tica por sobre todas las cosas a la vez que somos muy individualistas pol ticamente hablando no recibimos fondos de ninguna organizaci n pol tica ni se los damos tampoco no pertenecemos ni representamos ning n partido pol tico de cuba o de fuera de cuba
8050693 la creaci n art stica independiente en cuba se premia solo con persecuciones y rdenes de b squeda y captura por parte de la polic a de la dictadura
8050694 se fabric ya una vez un caso en contra de gorki que fue arrestado bajo cargos falsos y condenado a cuatro a os de prisi n
8050695 en aquella ocasi n continua se filmaba habana blues y el r gimen mantuvo a gorki encarcelado impidi ndole participar en la pel cula sobre la nueva m sica independiente y underground de cuba
8050696 en realidad el delito de gorki es solo uno t ener los cojones necesarios para denunciar los atropellos de la tiran a contra el pueblo cubano y la ilegitimidad del r gimen hereditario impuesto a cuba
8050697 toda la solidaridad para gorki que llegue este mensaje a todos los cantantes y m sicos de todos los rincones del mundo hay un colega que sufre persecuci n y prisi n por s lo hacer lo que ustedes hacen en completa libertad
8050698 please dont fail me wooden board you are my only friend
8050699 if you spend enough time here youll be the zebra eventually
8050700 when the mind is somber broad daylight gives birth to demons and evil spirits when the mind is clear a dark room has its blue sky that which is self concious and ulterior is far from the truth that which is mindless is near
8050701 its in that stupefying moment you realize that youre the architect of life but
8050702 hey jim look at the shiny mind ive got your internal space looks like a pile of shit
8050703 for informational purposes only this is not an exhaustive or recommended list
8050704 line that is designed to contribute to this renewed vision of christian spiritual formation
8050705 lectio divina instructor for dallas willards fuller seminary class spirituality and ministry
8050706 nothing more than turning our heart toward god and receiving in turn his love
8050707 silence and solitude are the outward physical manifestations of the inward surrender of the heart
8050708 but w e have not surrendered all else to attend to it alone
8050709 as thou art in church or cell that same frame of mind carry into the world into its turmoil and its fitfulness
8050710 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8050711 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8050712 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8050713 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8050714 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8050715 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8050716 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8050717 i can tell these anything that i want because theyre too ignorant to know the difference
8050718 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8050719 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8050720 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8050721 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8050722 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8050723 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8050724 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8050725 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8050726 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8050727 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8050728 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect
8050729 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
8050730 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8050731 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
8050732 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
8050733 what the exception says in essence is lobbyists cannot buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor one member
8050734 but they can buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor multiple members
8050735 any democrat or republican who said they were going to support us on health care or free choice and turns against us is going to paint a target
8050736 were not going to just win this election and hope barack obama does well people want something to happen
8050737 our members are sick and tired of politicians who are after their votes the day before the election and after their throats
8050738 for our members politics is not about democrats or republicans or left or right its about right and wrong
8050739 to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools
8050740 at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive
8050741 the fact that obama and ayers were working together stems from the pretty sharp left leaning ideology that both of them shared to some extent
8050742 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8050743 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8050744 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8050745 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaida and press russia to live up to its obligations
8050746 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8050747 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8050748 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8050749 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright
8050750 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8050751 much of the press is rolling over and playing dead american journalism is in need of a spine transplant
8050752 it seems like all the media can talk about is the disarray i mean they love that storyline and i get that
8050753 but the idea that theres going to be some coup or the idea that theres division honestly in this delegation is ridiculous
8050754 its a more personal perspective i think the traditional media has a role that requires a broader story to be told whereas we can kind of burrow down into the more granular politics
8050755 one of the things about blogging is that by doing it regularly and just kind of on a rolling basis its more of an opportunity to create a narrative as opposed to creating an isolated story
8050756 at some point people just get burned out on it so its a constant challenge to find new angles and keep people plugged into it

8050874 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

8050888 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
8050889 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
8050890 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
8050891 i was told at the time they were investigating alleged threats against foreigners by other foreigners and by chinese people
8050892 why are you in beijing what are you doing here who sent you here
8050893 my experience in china prior to that was great everyone was being friendly
8050894 further indication of why i need to do this work
8050895 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
8050896 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
8050897 while we do not condone mr romeros method the u s government supports his underlying message that calls for greater freedoms in china
8050898 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8050899 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8050900 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8050901 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8050902 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8050903 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8050904 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8050905 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8050906 we know he is flying into san francisco and from there hes going to try and take a southwest flight into l a
8050907 the chinese have destroyed all his papers his passport everything
8050908 so were not sure what happens when he gets to san francisco
8050909 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
8050910 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8050911 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8050912 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
8050913 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8050914 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
8050915 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
8050916 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8050917 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8050918 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8050919 do we treat teenagers like animals in heat or like people with a brain that have the ability to control themselves
8050920 we believe human beings can control their sexual desires and should be encouraged to
8050921 there has been a groundswell of opposition to these programs from states across the country and we thought we had put the issue to rest here in pennsylvania too
8050922 we are just trying to be fair across the board and make sure everyone has access to the funding they need

8050937 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
8050938 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties

8050948 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
8050949 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
8050950 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
8050951 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
8050952 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8050953 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek

8050993 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8050994 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek

8051008 todays lunch entree was a potato yukon gold from our csa topped with the leftover side dish from a couple of nights ago grilled eggplant in salsa which turned out to be essentially ratatouille with a mexican accent
8051009 this weeks meal entry was a totally local chicken gumbo it included chicken breast and chicken chorizo corn onions green pepper garlic tomatoes celery thyme and okra non local additions were salt pepper and oil it would have been better with bacon wouldnt everything but sadly we were out it was the only ingredient missing from the recipe though

8051034 and we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
8051035 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated

8051077 the main goal of my work is to understand the brain mechanisms that underlie typical healthy social development but i still hope that once we better understand healthy development that we can use this knowledge to look into what might go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders
8051078 we are not claiming it could diagnose autism merely that it may prove a useful early warning signal

8051121 he doesnt believe women deserve equal pay for equal work and he doesnt believe in womens right to choose
8051122 so the choice in this election could not be clearer and the stakes couldnt be higher
8051123 i ask all of you who worked so hard for me and who contributed so much to work as hard for barack obama in the next few months

8051147 notwithstanding any written law to the contrary any information from the dna databank shall be admissible as a conclusive proof of the dna identification in any proceeding in court
8051148 if this is the case the accused would not be in a position to question the validity of the evidence or the credibility of the chemist
8051149 very dangerous as it removes the courts ability to ensure the validity of all dna evidence tendered in court
8051150 we know through our practice as lawyers that the police when producing evidence are known to make mistakes
8051151 the courts role is to scrutinise the polices procedures in producing evidence and section 24 of the bill takes this process away
8051152 the bill was supposed to be tabled after the national kenaf and tobacco board bill but i was unwell so i asked for it to be moved down the order paper there is no sinister motive
8051153 some people think the classified advertisement market has reached the saturation point but it has only captured 27 per cent of the print advertisement market in malaysia

8051155 the bill was introduced to solve problems but it looks like it wont be able to do that
8051156 however the timing is bad in light of datuk seri anwar ibrahim sodomy charge
8051157 he has retired now and he has just written that to sell the book
8051158 ive never heard of that working how much difference could a breath mint make
8051159 if hes come out and said that hes used it yes its unethical
8051160 yes he got away with it good luck to him you cant change the result of the test series so its no good worrying about it
8051161 for me it doesnt totally tarnish it because what i did like about the england bowlers in that series was their wrist release and for the first 10 overs jones and flintoff got the new ball to swing beautifully but from the 20 to 45 over mark that is where the mints are helping
8051162 and they bowled better reverse swing than us they definitely got an illegal advantage over us in those overs
8051163 at least now we know why england lost the next ashes they lost their minty guy
8051164 if it was proved they cheated we would have a right to be upset
8051165 the three day test showed what crow said was a

8051168 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8051169 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8051170 and i said to myself something is going on here
8051171 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
8051172 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8051173 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8051174 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact

8051177 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8051178 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8051179 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8051180 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8051181 how can we compete with the rays white sox and twins

8051188 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo head s performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
8051189 therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father
8051190 whom christ god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it
8051191 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
8051192 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
8051193 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
8051194 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
8051195 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8051196 he that believeth not the son shall not see everlasting life but the wrath of god abideth or him
8051197 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god
8051198 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son
8051199 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality
8051200 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
8051201 and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshiped the beast and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years this is the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power
8051202 but the rest of the dead the wicked lived not again until the thousand years were finished
8051203 and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them
8051204 and death and hell margin the grave were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
8051205 the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone is the second death
8051206 he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
8051207 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be

8051222 whats wrong with you that you dont have a partner
8051223 some people seem to need the validation of being with another person as if that proves they have some value otherwise insufficiently evident ive never felt that need
8051224 well we fell in love and wanted to spend our lives together
8051225 i didnt fall in love with anyone i wanted to spend my life with
8051226 im still waiting for mr right to come along but he hasnt yet
8051227 maybe im just not good looking or interesting or charming enough to attract someone
8051228 i guess im too individualistic i like living alone my life is my own
8051229 maybe i dont send out the right erotic signals whatever they are to attract someone
8051230 i assumed it might happen at some point but it didnt
8051231 while the floodwaters of earlier this summer have receded for most the damages left behind are still very evident
8051232 i hope those affected who havent filed for federal assistance will take advantage of this extra window of opportunity
8051233 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8051234 i mean i suppose its a little slower than i thought and as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8051235 i cant i suppose expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and it is only five weeks since the operation
8051236 my understanding is he has got rid of all the cancers there is no evidence that it has jumped the fence
8051237 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8051238 it would have been terrible if she had jumped around like a chook with its head cut off
8051239 i think police that night did a marvellous job in very difficult circumstances very difficult mr cavanagh said
8051240 or any other prosecution witness either directly or through a third person
8051241 im certainly sorry he got dragged into this its an unfortunate thing to happen particularly while he is pursuing his career in golf
8051242 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8051243 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8051244 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8051245 speaking of adlai stevenson i just read the other day that he was actually considered a somewhat viable candidate for the 1960 election after losing the last two by a landslide each time

8051251 supe que hab a sucedido algo irreparable en el momento en que un hombre me abri la puerta de esa habitaci n de hotel y vi a mi mujer sentada al fondo mirando por la ventana de muy extra a manera fue a mi regreso de un viaje corto s lo cuatro d as por cosas de trabajo dice aguilar y asegura que al partir la dej bien cuando me fui no le pasaba nada raro o al menos nada fuera de lo habitual ciertamente nada que anunciara lo que iba a sucederle durante mi ausencia salvo sus propias premoniciones claro est pero c mo iba aguilar a creerle si agustina su mujer siempre anda pronosticando calamidades l ha tratado por todos los medios de hacerla entrar en raz n pero ella no da su brazo a torcer e insiste en que desde peque a tiene lo que llama un don de los ojos o visi n de lo venidero y s lo dios sabe dice aguilar lo que eso ha trastornado nuestras vidas esta vez como todas mi agustina pronostic que algo saldr a mal y yo como siempre pas por alto su pron stico me fui de la ciudad un mi rcoles la dej pintando de verde las paredes del apartamento y el domingo siguiente a mi regreso la encontr en un hotel al norte de la ciudad transformada en un ser aterrado y aterrador al que apenas reconozco no he podido saber qu le sucedi durante mi ausencia porque si se lo pregunto me insulta hay que ver cu n feroz puede llegar a ser cuando se exalta me trata como si yo ya no fuera yo ni ella fuera ella intenta explicar aguilar y si no puede es porque l mismo no lo comprende la mujer que amo se ha perdido dentro de su propia cabeza hace ya catorce d as que la ando buscando y me va la vida en encontrarla pero la cosa es dif cil es angustiosa a morir y jodidamente dif cil es como si agustina habitara en un plano paralelo al real cercano pero inabordable es como si hablara en una lengua extranjera que aguilar vagamente reconoce pero que no logra comprender la trastornada raz n de mi mujer es un perro que me tira tarascadas pero que al mismo tiempo me env a en sus ladridos un llamado de auxilio que no atino a responder agustina es un perro fam lico y malherido que quisiera volver a casa y no lo logra y al minuto siguiente es un perro vagabundo que ni siquiera recuerda que alguna vez tuvo casa

8051260 vegan food tends to have less fat in it a higher volume of fat delays gastric entry so with most vegan food you simply start processing your food faster its also the case that you might end up pacing yourself a bit better as the food needs more chewing people who wolf their food down tend to have a higher calorific intake
8051261 its important not to overstate the health benefits of vegan food
8051262 vegans can struggle to get sufficient amounts of calcium and vitamin b12 in their diet its all about getting the balance right and you can find the balance as a meat eater too its called the mediterranean diet
8051263 the macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called a mouse there is no evidence that people want to use these things
8051264 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8051265 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8051266 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health

8051270 they say rome wasnt built in a day i wasnt on that job
8051271 why are we happy about giving our babies something from a cows breast which is another species
8051272 theres so much pressure on you to breastfeed if you find it difficult and ask another woman to do it for you that would just reinforce the inadequacy youre already feeling
8051273 there is value in making clear as garraway does that formula is based on cows milk i think a lot of people dont realise that and it does have implications
8051274 what its all about for me is shifting the pressures off individual women and on to society so mothers themselves dont feel the weight of the debate so much what i want to do is make it possible for mothers to go on breastfeeding for as long as they want to because at the moment far too many women are stopping earlier than they would like
8051275 its a totally different ball game from feeding a growing baby at term and beyond
8051276 a normal size newborn would need something in the region of three quarters to a litre a day of milk it simply wouldnt be practical and more importantly its not what breast milk banks exist to do
8051277 this milk can be life saving its the best way of protecting against a condition called necrotising enterocolitis which kills one in five premature babies who contract it who would mind their baby being given something thats going to save his or her life
8051278 there are probably situations in which women help one another out by feeding each others babies
8051279 it happens all the time in africa and it happened all the time in the past in the west but as far as the future is concerned in the west i dont think its going to make a big impact although i am a bit worried about the possibility of it happening for gain i feel there are mothers out there who dont like the idea of using their own breasts for feeding but feel for health reasons theyd like their child to have breast milk i wouldnt rule out a bit of a growth in wealthy women looking for women they could pay to feed their babies
8051280 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8051281 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8051282 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8051283 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8051284 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8051285 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8051286 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8051287 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8051288 those who really desire to attain an independence have only to set their minds upon it and adopt the proper means and the thing is easily done but however easy it may be found to make money i have no doubt many of my hearers will agree it is the most difficult thing in the world to keep it
8051289 i know all about economy he thinks he does but he does not
8051290 there is scarcely anything that drags a person down like debt when you have it mastering you when interest is constantly piling up against you it will keep you down in the worst kind of slavery but let money work for you and you have the most devoted servant in the world
8051291 when a man is in the right path he must persevere how many have almost reached the goal of their ambition but losing faith in themselves have relaxed their energies and the golden prize has been lost forever
8051292 work at it if necessary early and late in season and out of season not leaving a stone unturned and never deferring for a single hour that which can be done just as well now
8051293 men should be systematic in their business a person who does business by rule having a time and place for everything doing his work promptly will accomplish twice as much and with half the trouble of him who does it carelessly and slipshod

8051298 are ebay fees paypal fees and shipping costs to the buyer considered cogs
8051299 statistics are never completely clear of course but its clear there is a significant change in behaviour under way theres now a real trend among french youths to drink more regularly usually at weekends to drink more to drink outside in the streets and to drink in order to get smashed all that is really quite new in france and it corresponds quite closely to the british definition of binge drinking
8051300 has made drunkenness among young people commonplace the ever mounting pressure to consume is meticulously organised
8051301 the signal sent by a total ban on the sale of alcohol to minors is very important in a country like france which has always tended to deny that alcohol can be harmful
8051302 but there needs to be a strong preventive strategy to accompany it we need to be able to discuss openly with young people without taboos the dangers and the attractions of alcohol
8051303 what are the best muscle mass building exercises to accomplish this
8051304 methods are many principles are few methods may change but principles never do
8051305 what are the best muscle mass building exercises to accomplish this
8051306 when i broke up with my husband last summer we decided to sell the house to split the equity and pay for the divorce
8051307 but despite dropping the price twice we still havent sold so were stuck in a situation where were still not divorced and although we try to maintain a reasonable front with each other in front of our six year old daughter underneath its very strained and there have been times when she has seen things she shouldnt have the emotional impact is massive and sometimes i feel like tearing my hair out my only saving grace is that since ive started telling people about it ive realised how common it is
8051308 what the little research out there does tell us is that people often have unspoken goals about money that they dont share even with each other
8051309 in times of economic boom they just get on with it but in times of uncertainty resentment can kick in well if you hadnt insisted on having this house or bought your 17th pair of shoes we wouldnt be in this situation oh and i suppose your top of the range satnav has nothing to do with us heading for debt and so on
8051310 money is one of the primary reasons or causes of a divorce and when you have a downward economy that exacerbates the financial troubles and tensions in marriage
8051311 were in a situation where creative problem solving is at an absolute premium in terms of choosing a divorce attorney
8051312 in a time of declining property values you do get cases where neither party wants to resolve matters until values of property have ceased falling
8051313 they simply subdivided their house into properties so the wife and children effectively occupied two thirds and the husband one third
8051314 my studio is in the home so moving out wasnt an option for me but i couldnt afford to buy him out of the mortgage right away the problem was he couldnt afford to move out until id done that so we were stuck thankfully we had a spare room
8051315 once you make the decision to separate you want to start your new life it stopped me dating and i didnt feel i could socialise at home then there were the little things such as washing and ironing do you get petty and say im not doing yours even though its in the basket do you say im only cooking my dinner not yours i didnt feel comfortable with that so we were still living much of our lives like a couple
8051316 its not that we werent civil to each other we have two children aged eight and five and were very mindful of them and still did some things with them together but my wife went off with someone else and that was hard the house is still on the market despite us dropping the price by 10 000 at a time i wonder when its ever going to end
8051317 i dealt with a guy who lived with his wife for a year while they waited to sell up shed left him but he still loved her
8051318 in the end he started doing things such as removing her food from the fridge and hiding her hair straighteners it doesnt sound much but imagine it all the time
8051319 those in council accommodation wouldnt be touched by a house sale and those at the top end still seem to be saying what spending problems despite the credit crunch
8051320 its the middle bracket where the primary asset is the house who are suffering they may well have stretched themselves for 15 or more years
8051321 despite splitting up with my boyfriend a month ago were having to live together until september in a rented one bedroom apartment where sleeping on the couch isnt even really an option for any length of time because its a two seater
8051322 its hideous but at 1 500 per month for a pretty standard flat in clapham south london theres no way one of us can move out because the other wouldnt be able to meet the bills thankfully there are nights when im able to stay away and sometimes he works overseas but there are times we have to share the bed with pillows down the middle
8051323 my partner and i separated before christmas but the house hasnt sold and its really stressful
8051324 i think the worst thing is that the children know were separated our families know and our friends know but were still here in this limbo state a couple of days ago the estate agent said we should drop the price again this time by 25 000 my partner says no way but part of me feels our situation is so desperate that maybe we should just do it so that we can get a buyer and move on with our lives
8051325 if youre a wife with a low income capacity and youre told your house has to be sold and that because your house is worth less than you thought you have to move into accommodation that you would never have dreamed about living in defending the divorce is one way to put a hold on everything the husband on the other hand may be keen to get divorced now because he is worth far less than he was six to 12 months ago which means the payout to his wife is far less than it would have been
8051326 ive seen clients recently where they weigh up the pros and cons and theyve agreed with their partner that splitting up is actually not worth it
8051327 he thinks the new rule on out of bounds plays will result in the loss of eight to 10 plays per game meaning the two clock rules are expected to cause the loss of a net four or five plays
8051328 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8051329 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
8051330 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8051331 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8051332 a monumental contribution and captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8051333 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8051334 if you want to know the truth the thing was broken
8051335 nothing the thing didnt work i was laughing at them you know if i was doing anything i was grabbing it and trying to put it back down
8051336 a change in government if it comes at all could see the stock market rattled because during the transition period we dont know what to expect
8051337 one of the things investors look for is predictability the political situation in malaysia currently is not the most predictable
8051338 its not as clear as it could be and i think that is keeping people wondering
8051339 from the feedback i get from the ground so far fund managers are all waiting to see what is going to happen
8051340 its not just the political backdrop the inflation the global economic slowdown the crude palm oil prices are all major concerns
8051341 if you are looking at long term investment then now is a good time to accumulate but if you have a trading mentality then its difficult
8051342 its good for the country in the long term development but all these initial pains are part of the development of a open economy
8051343 this is his political base and the results reflected that there was no manipulation involved
8051344 there was not much difference in the number of votes garnered by anwar when compared with that won by his wife datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail in march
8051345 we need to look at our weaknesses but nevertheless we respect the peoples choice
8051346 the foundation is a fairly new project in atlanta so we feel like it is a little exorbitant
8051347 i believe the atlanta police foundation has been as effective as any other police foundation in the country
8051348 two its the largest and three its just exceptionally run
8051349 donors dont want to contribute to salaries they want to contribute to the fulfillment of the nonprofits mission
8051350 i think dave should make more money than what hes making now
8051351 our foundation has just decided to be more strategic and involved
8051352 youre spending 50 percent of my money not toward programs and thats what im giving you money for
8051353 we knew we were going to have to pay substantially more than what we were paying previously
8051354 we need a president who will work hard for us
8051355 first person to predict amy winehouses current state of deshabillement
8051356 mum hates me eating junk she wont have it in the house
8051357 a kids gotta eat junk sometimes its not natural not to

8051361 this is my ninth convention im not involved much in democratic party affairs in fact i wasnt involved in democratic party affairs when i ran for president until i got the nomination
8051362 i was in wales earlier this year on the stage and a reporter asked me if i thought it was possible for obama to change the american image around the world in the first 100 days i said he can change it in the first 10 minutes
8051363 he can say that in 10 minutes and it will transform the image of america around the world

8051376 when the policemen tried to flag the van down several men alighted from the vehicle while the taxi sped off one of the patrol cars gave chase
8051377 two of the men who alighted from the van tried to attack the policemen who opened fire in self defence
8051378 we increased our patrols in the area and stumbled upon the suspects in two vehicles
8051379 he was unloading his luggage from the van to a trolley when the robbers in ski masks struck
8051380 they fired at least 10 shots at the victim before grabbing his luggage and fled the scene in a black toyota harrier
8051381 the sultan and i had agreed that any overlapping claims of interest over the border should be settled in an amicable agreement in view of our countries good relations
8051382 the sultan had conveyed his wish for more cooperation programmes such as the ftc to be initiated and those already in place to be further improved
8051383 he also told me that brunei was keen to take a more active part in economic cooperation with malaysia especially in sarawak and sabah
8051384 we are hopeful that the business community in brunei will invest here after the sultans visit
8051385 i am happy with what i heard and feel very confident that more investors will be interested to be part of the development corridor
8051386 every series is a big series we need every win now
8051387 they want change and freedom for the judiciary and the media they want economic growth to benefit the majority

8051389 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and innovations that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
8051390 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8051391 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
8051392 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
8051393 what the exception says in essence is lobbyists cannot buy influence by paying for a lavish party to honor one member
8051394 shes not sure what she what she wants to be when she grows up
8051395 clearly im very pleased that the mccain team and the national republican party chose to put us on the podium
8051396 i think it speaks well of how they view our campaign
8051397 le prix pay est de 775 millions d euros sur la base d une valeur d entreprise de 800 millions d euros
8051398 l conomie fiscale relative l utilisation des d ficits reportables estim e en premi re approche 350 millions d euros
8051399 dont you think theyd love to bankrupt us as we did to them in the cold war
8051400 obama has gone negative so much for the politics of change
8051401 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8051402 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8051403 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8051404 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8051405 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8051406 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8051407 im not in any way trying to promote my qualifications or to dissuade others of my disqualifications to serve on a mccain ticket
8051408 wont make a lick of difference to struggling american families
8051409 i dont have anything to tell you about senator mccains vice presidential selection process
8051410 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8051411 they shouldnt allow it to escalate to a point where people loose their lives or loose their property
8051412 i saw a line of police vehicles that appeared to be chasing another vehicle
8051413 that vehicle rear ended the car behind me which then rear ended me
8051414 i have concerns and i have asked the chief in the past to just coordinate with the constables the sheriff
8051415 i mean i havent seen that much action since my first tour of duty in told nbc 5 he would talk to the constables about their more liberal chase policy
8051416 and i can certainly respect the position theyve taken with pursuits because its taken me a long time to come to where we are today in dallas
8051417 sometime they fly over in intervals of just a few minutes it causes stress to build up
8051418 honestly the outcome of the iwakuni election was a relief
8051419 the relocation only shifts the burden from one region to another which is not a solution
8051420 the noise is so loud that i cannot even hear the television
8051421 one cannot simply deal with the din through data iwakuni is going to be suffer from now on
8051422 aircraft carriers spend most of their time at sea so u s officials took the public position that the carrier would only be at yokosuka for repairs and rest and relaxation for its crew thus its sailors were never counted in the total of american personal stationed in japan but from the beginning the military treated yokosuka as a home port
8051423 by placing a nuclear carrier in japan the united states seems intent on sending a message to countries it regards as potential enemies that it is committed to continuing to station a carrier nearby
8051424 over 50 years u s nuclear ships have never had an atomic reactor accident and have never had a radiation leak that negatively affected people or sea life
8051425 even people who were once indifferent are now helping us with this campaign
8051426 if the navy conducted nlp somewhere other than atsugi it still would not be quiet

8051461 our opportunity this week is to back up essentially and thats something that we havent been able to do for some time
8051462 when you get experiences like last week under your belt it contributes to belief if you use it in the right way if it contributes to an over confidence then it will bite you
8051463 a win would be very special not so much for the history its not something that weve spoken about thats the first ive heard of it
8051464 weve come over here with two games our focus is to win both those games so that would be very special more from the team point of view
8051465 weve obviously set our goals very high and we want to achieve those

8051503 i love painting eyes they really are the windows to the soul
8051504 if i see a photograph of a face and it has good contrast ill do a painting its especially good if the person isnt showing any teeth i hate to paint teeth
8051505 in those days the stars were always being asked for autographs so it wasnt such a big deal
8051506 every time id paint a celebrity id send a duplicate of the painting so he or she could keep it making a copy was much quicker than painting the original

8051520 i wrote to sen obama asking for a picture he sent back a lovely photograph of his wife and him along with his autograph

8051542 i was told that a bus company could suffer losses of up to about rm100 000 a day
8051543 when we put more buses on the road during the holidays our drivers get triple salary
8051544 i was a rookie last year and was unfamiliar with the conditions and players ive adjusted well now and im ready to go
8051545 ive been working extremely hard and never took a break i told myself that the reason i lost out last year was because i wasnt working hard enough on my game
8051546 i have to drive it well here my goal is to keep my card but i hope my hard work will pay off with a win this week
8051547 i will treat this event like any other tournament so that way i will be more relaxed im happy with my form since the bangkok airways open in june and i hope to finish strongly here
8051548 many universities are busy with the mid semester examinations now
8051549 discussions on this matter have not gone beyond the coffee table yes the idea was brought to me verbally but its only talk and decisions cannot be made from that
8051550 we need to speak not only to the national sports associations nsas but to also get reaction from the public before making a decision as this is a sensitive issue
8051551 however this practice is not new to malaysia we have adopted athletes before like in the case of yuan yufang however we have also found out that having them around does not mean guaranteed success
8051552 they are aware of the importance of developing local athletes in attaining glory at the highest level sometimes theres no glory when adopted athletes win medals for a particular country
8051553 in my personal view it will be better to groom local athletes although it will be a slow process at least there will be a sense of national pride and dignity when they attain success

8051558 this is actually the first time ive done interviews since ive been here so its actually been kind of nice not to have to deal with all that after being in the l a media for five years
8051559 obviously ive got such a ways to go and i think i can get so much better
8051560 but i feel good about what ive done im not satisfied or content with the way things have gone but its a great opportunity for me to be around these coaches and learn from them
8051561 i just want to go out and enjoy it i come out here and enjoy every day there is uncertainty i hope it does work out i hope i can be a part of this but you never know
8051562 theres so much going on and so much that you have to know from audibles fronts coverages everything
8051563 for me getting all the reps in college at sc and then to get here and not get as many thats definitely the biggest challenge for me to overcome
8051564 theres too many what ifs and then youve screwed up what you need to do which is your job
8051565 im good right now like ive said since the spring whatever happens is going to happen ive got a better perspective now i would say

8051577 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8051578 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america

8051734 he is still only 21 so that means that we are getting a player who has huge potential and is at the early stage of his career

8051764 however we are at the dawn of the digital book era and while jeff bezos has reasons to be happy with its current sales volumes it does not pose a serious threat to traditional books as we know them today and will not do so for some time
8051765 certain book aficionados and early adopters and appears to get high marks from users who have purchased it

8051767 now i rejoice in what was suffered for you and i fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to christs afflictions for the sake of his body which is the church i have become its servant by the commission god gave me to present to you the word of god in its fullness the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations but is now disclosed to the saints to them god has chosen to make known among the gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory we proclaim him admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone perfect in christ to this end i labor struggling with all his energy which so powerfully works in me
8051768 i fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to christs afflictions

8051912 i bought a box set of gospel music a few years ago and lent it to spencer he called me back three hours later saying i have a song and singing secular lyrics
8051913 we had about 25 songs going into the studio with this cd having enough songs never seems to be a problem the problem is finding the money to pay for them
8051914 then theres the cost of mixing and engineering that isnt cheap
8051915 so far its all been good its been getting good reviews
8051916 were really inspired by our experiences with old vinyl records when music was a sensual experience you could read the lyric sheets and look at the art and hold it in your hand while listening now you just put a cd in the slot
8051917 its actually cheaper to go to europe playing music fesivals
8051918 not that festivals pay a lot but they pay for your room and food which really cuts down on expenses
8051919 people are starting to listen to it more it isnt new its been out there for many years its just now people are giving it attention its a good thing
8051920 before you order let me tell you about my food i cook everything to order we have burgers and fish sandwiches with mahi mahi the burgers are the kong burger which are this big his hands up as if to hold a sandwich fingers extended to their full length as if to make a giant ellipse and they cost 14 each it comes with cheese lettuce maui onion roasted pineapple tomato and mustard and catchup i wrap it in the foil and if you unwrap it then it will fall apart i only cook meat with meat and fish with fish so if you want both youll have to wait
8051921 ok great well take a burger and three fish sandwiches
8051922 my food is expensive but those hotels they charge hotel prices but they serve you shit
8051923 they are all crooks they steal from each other i was in the business but i didnt want any part of it
8051924 these people these people dont want to wait they dont know good food
8051925 if you add to much of that stuff you cant taste it my stuff is seasoned plenty hot enough
8051926 i dont know why but we just never had the opportunity to drive together at the mme perhaps we never really thought about it
8051927 maybe its because we were so close we just wanted to beat one another for the fun of it
8051928 the team looks strong this year and i must admit that its been a long time coming with me finally partnering kiefli in the same car
8051929 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
8051930 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
8051931 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
8051932 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
8051933 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
8051934 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup

8051958 internet advertising is currently growing at a compound annual rate of 18 3 and will reach 73 billion in 2011 what is really exciting about mobile advertising is its ability to eclipse internet advertising

8052026 we would soon start battery operated rickshaws and would urge the delhi high court to allow rickshaw pullers to use them in the old city currently there are roads where rickshaws are not permitted entry because of the courts directions
8052027 it was painful to see rickshaw pullers carry people but these new rickshaws would help reduce such stress on them

8052093 gajo n o sejas parvo acordaste deprimido s isso nunca ouviste falar em dias de merda
8052094 n o te percebo n o s velho n o s feio n o me lembro quantos anos nos conhecemos mas sempre foste um gajo simp tico n o sei como que ainda n o arranjaste ningu m s esquisito tens medo
8052095 esquisito n o sou sincero se n o me agrada fisicamente n o tenho interesse se n o me agrada psicologicamente n o tenho interesse em lado algum vez especificado que tem de ser uma top model ou algu m com o qi do einstein acho que quando a encontrar dou por ela e sim o desconhecido passado uns tempos deixa de ser interessante e passa a assustador
8052096 o que tu queres ut pico todos temos defeitos aceitar os defeitos dos outros e a parte mais dif cil de uma rela o
8052097 tu que falaste em perfei o eu simplesmente n o acredito que me cruze com uma rapariga qualquer e passado duas semanas j estejamos a dizer um ao outro que nos amamos e tal estas coisas levam tempo n o quero uma top model para me sentir feio ou uma g nia qualquer para me sentir burro e gostava de acordar todos os dias olhar para o lado acha la bonita e n o me aborrecer com as conversas que tiv ssemos assim t o complicado
8052098 se n o conheceres mais mi das nunca vais descobrir a certa mas tamb m n o podes ir numa de eliminar as coitadas ao primeiro defeito
8052099 n o se trata de defeitos e duvido que n o me fa am o mesmo trata se de achar que uma rela o de jeito leva tempo a construir e quando olho minha volta as que vou conhecendo acho cedo para sentir o que quer que seja por elas e as que conhe o o suficiente para sentir alguma coisa mais geralmente ou j t m algu m que as fa a felizes ou a rela o entre mim e ela j atingiu um estado em que se perde demasiado no caso de n o dar resultado
8052100 e na maioria das vezes se arriscar vou sair a perder
8052101 tu est s com essa falta de f empedernida nesse cora ozinho
8052102 achas ent o entremos no campo das suposi es imagina me a mim um gajo solit rio que n o gosta de confus es como todo o ser humano sinto falta de algu m em quem pensar quando oi o aquela m sica lamechas na r dio ou de algu m que possa abra ar porque simplesmente me apeteceu ou porque hoje a achei particularmente amorosa algu m com quem possa ter a conversa mais parva do mundo e ser compreendido
8052103 vamos supor com essa descri o n o temos muito que supor tu desenvolveste foi alergia as tampas e est s borradinho
8052104 agora imagina que neste estado de ansiedade eu descubro que algu m que eu conhecia uns anos se estava a tornar especial como que achas que devia reagir ou pensar n o ser tudo da ansiedade e porqu agora ser que ao fim deste tempo todo devo arriscar tudo por um sentimento que tanto quanto sei pode desaparecer t o depressa como apareceu
8052105 e se for ansiedade e se for porque provavelmente ou finalmente abriste os olhos e se for assim que conheces a pessoa certa ou come as um dos relacionamentos mais importantes da tua vida n o achas que se essa pessoa te conhece a tanto tempo n o agora que te vai querer perder mesmo que isso signifique que n o sinta por ti o mesmo
8052106 isso tudo muito cor de rosa queres que eu te mostre o quanto
8052107 imagina que essa pessoa eras tu imagina que eras tua a pessoa que eu conhecia aos anos e que eu tinha aprendido a achar especial
8052108 ent o que que me dizias poss vel tu s um amor de mi da s gira e j te conhe o muito tempo e tu a mim as conversas at ver n o me parecem chatas deixei de ser um po o de qualidades
8052109 ent o o qu viste que n o assim t o simples
8052110 nunca disse que era simplesmente acho que se isso se passasse nunca tinha pensado nisso daquelas coisas que nunca pus a hip tese de acontecer
8052111 ok mas continuavas com essas ideias suicidas de eu me mandar de cabe a
8052112 dizia te para ires com calma sem promessas e sem compromissos podia resultar ou falhar nisto o resultado sempre incerto
8052113 n o queiras nunca viver a vida t o depressa especialmente em rela o a sentimentos t o importantes se ela j passa num instante os momentos importantes ainda s o mais fugazes e sentimentos desses s o para apreciar o mais lentamente poss vel
8052114 achas mesmo que era poss vel qualquer coisa entre n s os dois
8052115 bem eu realmente devo ser dos gajos mais ansiosos face da terra e tu as vezes falas me de uma maneira que se n o te conhecesse mais tempo ia jurar que estavas interessada mas n o tu que s mesmo assim j aprendi a viver com os teus elogios amorosos agora em rela o a existir alguma coisa entre n s tamb m n o te sei responder acho que ia mos pelo teu conselho com calma sem promessas e sem compromissos
8052116 s t o racional e tens uma carapa a emocional t o grande que at irrita v l se um dia a quebras ou sais de vez da de dentro vais ver que encontras logo algu m
8052117 olha minha querida seria uma honra e um prazer ser objecto do teu afecto e durante o tempo que tivesse de ser estar e ter te por perto melhor ainda seria faze lo dentro da minha carapa a
8052118 mi da n o penses mais nisso olha entretanto parou de chover j podes ir para a praia
8052119 e numa tentativa de se auto convencer l ia pensando
8052120 i love america thats why it needs to be destroyed
8052121 siento mejor a hay semanas que parece que se atranca la progresi n pero es porque este tipo de lesiones exige muchos meses de trabajo me gustar a estar listo antes pero las cosas son como son y no debemos precipitarnos
8052122 si yo no s nada y el club tampoco es que no hay negociaci n abierta de todas formas en el caso de que llegue a haber algo no me voy a ir este a o no pienso en salir y no voy a valorarlo prefiero volver a jugar donde estoy m s c modo en el celta
8052123 la pretemporada ha sido fant stica hay muchos jugadores nuevos que vienen en una situaci n diferente a la del a o pasado todos saben c mo est el celta y qu problemas tienen por eso han venido tan comprometidos tenemos una base fant stica y estoy muy contento con el grupo de este a o
8052124 hay gente competente en cada zona del campo jugar n los que el mister considere que est n mejor pero los que queden fuera van a ayudar al grupo a mejorar esto es muy largo y todos van a tener su oportunidad el objetivo tiene que ser com n el f tbol es un deporte colectivo e independientemente de los once que sean titulares el s bado todos intentaremos que gane el celta que las cosas vayan bien desde el principio

8052128 sir i was that student i failed to persevere in my work because it seemed so demanding now i have slipped right back as your correct amp honest estimation of my present work shows
8052129 a number of guys were into cars and wanted to contribute to the church but not
8052130 we started in 2 000 and it was originally to do f1 ministry but it was unsustainable so we decided to look at outreach and pit lane bible studies at grass roots events
8052131 what we do is to take cars and link them to church work i took mine to a family fun day which gave something for the guys to do many church related days dont attract men because they dont realise you can enjoy sport and be a christian
8052132 i use it in events as im a member of the all wheel club but i also use i for outreach i would usually offer church people the chance to bring non christian friends to back country off road driving days some of the precipitous drops they will go up and down are enough to make anyone feel close to god
8052133 its bringing the faith to people in an exciting setting because it is exciting being christian
8052134 en el pa s de los cuentos hab a una vez un peque o duende un duende muy

8052141 our lease has expired and we are unable to negotiate a new one at this time we greatly value your business and want to do whatever it takes to make your transition to one of our other two rochester locations as smooth as possible in order not to disturb your workout routine we do understand this is an inconvenience and sincerely apologize

8052143 with this new understanding of the nature of god comes a new concept of love as well a love determined by the nature of the subject who loves rather than by the nature of the object loved
8052144 plato gives a revealing picture of socrates in the symposium socrates reports to his friends how a wise woman explained to him that love is not something the greatest of the gods can experience she said that to love means to desire and desire is an indication of need we love another because the other meets a need in our own experience we know that the great gods are perfect and have no needs therefore how can the gods love the assumption behind platos whole discussion is the conviction that the lover seeks in the beloved the fulfillment of the lovers own needs socrates could not conceive of love that was primarily concerned with what the lover could do for the loved rather than what the lover could acquire from the loved to socrates love is self oriented and concerned with how the other can satisfy the needs of the lover
8052145 the unique picture of love jesus presents was the exact opposite of the picture that the wise men of his world understood jesus embodies the old testament revelation of gods
8052146 jesus paradigm is of one who loves to give whether the recipient responds or not
8052147 a son honors his father and a servant his master
8052148 mas por que gritar quando a outra pessoa est ao seu lado
8052149 bem gritamos porque desejamos que a outra pessoa nos ou a
8052150 ent o n o poss vel falar lhe em voz baixa
8052151 voc s sabem porque se grita com uma pessoa quando se est aborrecido o fato que quando duas pessoas est o aborrecidas seus cora es se afastam muito para cobrir esta dist ncia precisam gritar para poderem escutar se mutuamente quanto mais aborrecidas estiverem mais forte ter o que gritar para ouvir um ao outro atrav s da grande dist ncia por outro lado o que sucede quando duas pessoas est o enamoradas elas n o gritam falam suavemente e por qu porque seus cora es est o muito perto a dist ncia entre elas pequena s vezes est o t o pr ximos seus cora es que nem falam somente sussurram e quando o amor mais intenso n o necessitam sequer sussurrar apenas se olham e basta seus cora es se entendem isso que acontece quando duas pessoas que se amam est o pr ximas

8052221 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8052222 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
8052223 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8052224 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others

8052227 the institution of the eucharist as recorded in the new testament of necessity presupposes a ritual essentially not in details to be sure but essentially like that of the aphikomen

8052235 it is a fascinating thought that once upon a time a horse was born that turned grey and subsequently white and the people that observed it were so fascinated by its spectacular appearance that they used the horse for breeding so that the mutation could be transmitted from generation to generation
8052236 we propose that the grey mutation stimulates growth of melanocytes and that this leads to a premature loss of the melanocyte stem cells needed for hair pigmentation whereas the mutation promotes an expansion of some of the melanocytes causing skin pigmentation
8052237 it is very likely that regulatory mutations like the one we found in these white horses constitute the dominating class of mutations explaining differences between breeds of domestic animals as well as between species like humans and chimpanzee

8052313 el tema de los residuos en espa a est descontrolado el ministerio de medio ambiente ni siquiera centraliza la informaci n y son las grandes empresas las que se han hecho con el negocio de hacer desaparecer la basura por eso optan por incineradoras no por tratamientos espec ficos para reciclar
8052314 el problema es de partida en espa a el 90 de los residuos van a vertedero o incineradora no hay apoyo al reciclaje
8052315 y as nos va tratar la basura en origen es lo nico que solucionar a el problema los espa oles generan cada a o un 5 de residuos m s que el anterior mientras que el reciclaje lleva una d cada estancado por debajo del 10 as en 2008 nos encontramos con los vertederos colapsados normal
8052316 en europa de media el 28 de los residuos son incinerados dinamarca llega al 60 en espa a no pasamos del 7 por eso queremos construir entre 14 y 17 nuevas plantas en la pr xima d cada para llegar al menos al 20 de la basura generada
8052317 la incineraci n es sin duda la peor opci n para tratar los residuos
8052318 primero porque es la soluci n m s cara segundo porque en contra de lo que se dice no es una alternativa al vertedero el 30 de la basura que entra se convierte en cenizas t xicas que luego hay que llevar a vertederos especiales tercero porque a pesar de todos los avances tecnol gicos sigue emitiendo a la atm sfera part culas contaminantes y cuarto porque desincentiva el reciclaje las empresas incineradoras esperan de los ayuntamientos que les manden cuanta m s basura mejor porque se es su negocio
8052319 en realidad entre tirar la basura a un vertedero y quemarla en una incineradora no hay gran diferencia son soluciones finalistas una vez que nos desborda la basura lo resolvemos as buscando d nde meterla
8052320 se es el problema apostar por soluciones finalistas lo que hay que evitar es que se genere ese volumen de residuos tan alto con programas de concienciaci n ciudadana y mucha m s inversi n para la red de reciclaje poner dinero en ese trabajo previo no en construir plantas ni vertederos
8052321 pero son m s de 200 sustancias las que una planta de incineraci n emite a la atm sfera y controladas no est n m s de 20
8052322 no hay filtros para los furanos y eso no s lo contamina el aire sino toda la cadena alimentaria hay empresas de alimentaci n que en los contratos con sus suministradores de materia prima obligan a que las verduras sean de campos donde no haya una incineradora cerca la industria sabe que el problema existe
8052323 en su d a se fijaron unos l mites de emisiones lo que hay que hacer es vigilar que se cumplan esos l mites y en europa se cumplen no hay riesgos pero sobre todo no hay ninguna duda de que el vertedero es mucho m s contaminante que la incineradora el 4 de los gases de efecto invernadero proviene de la gesti n de residuos y de sos el 90 es de los vertederos
8052324 la ltima directiva de gesti n de residuos aprobada por el parlamento europeo el pasado junio aunque a n no publicada obliga a dejar el vertedero como ltima soluci n de gesti n de la basura el objetivo es que en 2020 los residuos sean o reciclados o convertidos en abono o eliminados obteniendo energ a las incineradoras resuelven eso queman la basura y generan energ a es una f rmula que la sociedad necesita m s ahora que se buscan fuentes de energ a alternativas
8052325 no debemos sobredimensionar las plantas de incineraci n por puro negocio hay que combinar esta opci n con una apuesta por el reciclaje
8052326 por primera vez europa cataloga las incineradoras como elementos de aprovechamiento energ tico no de eliminaci n de basura se olvidan de que incinerar desincentiva el reciclaje que es la aut ntica manera de ahorrar energ a
8052327 los pa ses que m s reciclan de europa alemania francia dinamarca holanda suecia son tambi n los que m s porcentaje de basura incineran y los que menos recurren al vertedero justo al rev s que espa a
8052328 lo peligroso de las incineradoras son las cenizas volantes que se generan en la combusti n las pavesas y los productos que se usan para neutralizar el cloro y el azufre
8052329 s lo representa un 4 de la basura que entra
8052330 y eso se entierra a los tres d as en vertederos especiales guardado en sacos de doble capa
8052331 las incineradoras tienen los l mites m s estrictos que hay en espa a sobre emisi n de contaminantes si te pasas de ese l mite se para la planta si le aplicasen a todas las industrias los l mites de emisi n que nos aplican a nosotros las dioxinas que se emiten proceden de 28 fuentes distintas industrias tabaco tr fico incendios y s lo el 0 001 es responsabilidad de las plantas de incineraci n

8052356 this shouldnt be a partisan issue it should be a personal freedom issue
8052357 my point is simple is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility
8052358 why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state
8052359 should republicans adopt a party plank at the upcoming national convention to rescind the ban on internet gambling
8052360 go to the republican partys web site and start scrolling through the responses to the platform you will see an army of poker players arguing it is time for republicans to end their opposition to gambling online
8052361 a lot of republicans have a love hate relationship with the poker community
8052362 a lot of republicans play poker but the christian right wants to ban poker playing
8052363 even the most ambitious gamblers know getting republicans to publicly support them is not a safe bet

8052371 but we all know and its obvious that if we repeal roe vs wade tomorrow thousands of young american women would be undergoing illegal and dangerous operations
8052372 i have always believed in the importance of the repeal of roe vs wade and as president i would work toward its repeal but that must take place in conjunction with a sustained effort to reduce the number of abortions performed in america
8052373 i will continue to work with both pro life and pro choice americans so that we can eliminate the need for abortions

8052584 yes sar they are having a problem a big problem with our sridhar
8052585 it seems the watchman next door his wife left and since sunday shes been with sridhar in his flat
8052586 perhaps the husband was beating her up and sridhar had to save her
8052587 would he come to work tomorrow no he cant theyll lynch him
8052588 what if they show up at yor doorstep tomorrow hand in hand pleading for you to protect them would you take them in
8052589 no dont even suggest that its sooo very possible that it could actually happen god forbid
8052590 no one really knows marshall yet in iowa or anywhere else in the nation but we did something very unsuaul at seiu because we wanted to test out the presidential candidates to see if they could just hang out with regular people
8052591 now marshalls a school worker in cedar rapids he got the opportunity to spend a day with joe biden joe biden walked a day in marshalls shoes in some ways hes a one person focus group and everybody wants to know like what are the white guys going to think about this ticket and what will joe biden mean to this ticket joe biden spent a day fixing a boiler in the cedar rapids school district went to marshalls house for dinner you can go to www seiu org and watch joe biden knows what it means to work this is not a guy who cant figure out how many homes he owns hes the guy who went home every night every night to be with his family while john mccain pays 250 000 people to take care of all of the homes he owns in america thats not right
8052592 ze szczeg ln pow ci gliwo ci i ostro no ci
8052593 if i had to base my vote on how his supporters have been treating us id be voting for mccain
8052594 its not hillarys job to unite the party its his
8052595 in other words she plans to wait and see whether obama can win over her and other staunch clinton backers who she feels have often been disrespected by the obama forces
8052596 if i had to base my vote on how his supporters have been treating us id be voting for mccain
8052597 eventually the one child baits the sister until the sister overreacts and then the parents have to step in
8052598 i think the media has everyone in a frenzy over this theyre looking for drama and theyre getting it
8052599 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
8052600 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either
8052601 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
8052602 to get 18 million votes and then not have your name placed in the nomination is just not going to be cool for a lot of people
8052603 theres still a sizable percentage of us that hes got to convince between now and november that he deserves our vote
8052604 i like joe biden i think hes a great guy it doesnt make me any more confident in barack obama he has to show that he deserves our vote
8052605 i think that there are a lot of delegates a lot of clinton delegates who feel that they havent been treated fairly that they dont have a voice
8052606 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
8052607 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
8052608 if i had to base my vote on how his supporters have treated us id be voting for mccain
8052609 but for a delegate even to hint that they may cross to mccain because their first choice didnt win is destructive
8052610 but then again i can name friends who are still ticked off that bobby kennedy lost to eugene mccarthy here in oregon that makes me officially old
8052611 oregon the land of clean air clean water and clean politics
8052612 wow do i really want these children running the country
8052613 if she signals ambivalence some supporters could stay home this fall
8052614 still faithful clinton supporters came together sunday at a denver eatery to screen a documentary critical of obama
8052615 keep to your principles sue if were really lucky the delegates will get smart and vote in hillary tomorrow if not well have 4 years of mccain followed hopefully by another run by hillary this time with an intelligent democratic leadership supporting her
8052616 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for in november
8052617 it doesnt make me any more confident in barack obama
8052618 i think that there are a lot of delegates a lot of clinton delegates who feel that they havent been treated fairly that they dont have a voice
8052619 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
8052620 a democratic loss in november she says is the only way to prod party leaders to reform what some clinton supporters call a broken nomination system
8052621 we obama supporters have to stop sniping at clinton supporters clinton supporters need to take a deep breath and take a fresh look at the situation
8052622 your own running mate doesnt think that youre the right person to be president why should the rest of us think so
8052623 no man you elbowed me under the basket when you were a blazer
8052624 of course i said that ages ago but over the past year i have come to know senator obama in the senate and wtched him on the campaign trail and i do think he is ready to lead now
8052625 yeah i thought a few months ago that his message was bullshit but now that i take another look yeah its the genuine article i was just bullshitting the country back then
8052626 putting barack obama in the white house is not just a victory for our party but a renewal for our nation
8052627 you have to give a complaint madam then we will send someone to look at it
8052628 no you have to come to office and make a complaint madam
8052629 tsk tsk they dont know what is the problem its the rains
8052630 but it hasnt been raining for a week tell them if they cant fix it well disconnect the line
8052631 maam its hopeless they cant fix it somewhere the line is damaged and they cant find where
8052632 but the phone is working perfectly always has been its the same line thats coming into the house what do they mean they cant locate the damage the cable is not even underground its hanging in the air from the signal box right into our house
8052633 tsk tsk they wont do anything i think we should just cancel the connection
8052634 if you didnt have adult onset diabetes i wouldnt mind giving you a little sugar
8052635 illusion michael a trick is something a whore does for money or candy
8052636 if you do not know a local language its very easy for people to cheat you
8052637 the cityscape is growing and people seem to be always in a rush but still there is a section which believes in helping and providing comfort to others
8052638 the first time we came here we stayed in a hotel with hardly any outings
8052639 i love going to the monda market which looks very colourful with fresh vegetables and hawkers screaming from top of their voices its a very noisy place but so much fun
8052640 while purchasing the entry tickets at charminar i spoke in hindi the counter person thought me to be an indian and gave me a local ticket instead of a foreign one it was one of my success stories and i shared it with my hindi teacher too
8052641 the vacation passed off peacefully with no one fooling us

8052648 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
8052649 a person with this kind of faith lives by the unspoken motto i believe god as long as he does what i ask
8052650 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the lord as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
8052651 what about those times when god does not work according to your requests or expectations
8052652 if god is not obvious he is obviously not god

8052659 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
8052660 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
8052661 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
8052662 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
8052663 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
8052664 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music

8052668 het klopt dat de wegen van vincent en huizen 5 scheiden
8052669 in de pers wordt vincent nu opgevoerd als een ordinaire zakkenroller maar het verhaal ligt wel iets genuanceerder vincent wordt al twee jaar lang achtervolgd door een contributieachterstand van 50 en dreigt daardoor te worden geroyeerd vincent is principieel en vindt niet dat hij ervoor op hoeft te draaien dat er een schuld is ontstaan als gevolg van overmatige betalingen aan huizen 1 spelers in het verleden toen vincent vanavond ineens arnold klein aan het werk zag bij dovo brak er iets in hem en hij heeft als ware hij in trance gehandeld arnold klein maakte zoals bekend in de periode waarin de schuld ontstond deel uit van huizen 1 en vincent dacht zijn achterstand terug te halen bij iemand die er in zijn ogen voor op zou moeten draaien

8052688 there are benefits and thats why it has persisted its a tough message to hear while you are in depression but i think that theres a life afterwards
8052689 i have received e mails from ex sufferers saying in retrospect it probably did help them because they changed direction a new career for example and as a result theyre more content day to day than before the depression
8052690 psychological unease can generate creative work and the rebirth after depression brings a new love affair with life
8052691 dont beat yourself up about being depressed in most cases it will run its course provided you take yourself out of the situation that caused it
8052692 i know thats an easy and glib thing to say because im not a single mum living 12 floors up in a high rise block sometimes its not easy to escape but thats the fault of society not the fault of depression
8052693 everybodys life is full of occasional misery and we are going to suffer all life ends in grief unless you are lucky and you and your loved ones all die simultaneously in some plane crash
8052694 so i applaud the government for trying but i think the happiness agenda can be simplistic you cant legislate for happiness
8052695 you would never ask for it or want it this way but people who work through it with a professional or with friends and family for those people who have an awful journey they are better travellers
8052696 i dont think that knowing the cause is always the route out changing circumstances is a major part of it but its not always something you can change sometimes the big problem is admitting what the situation is
8052697 they say adversity makes you stronger so i should be superman by now
8052698 oh im glad i went through that because now i can am

8052735 what was scary was how many people didnt put two and two together that wheat berries make flour

8052740 i missed my band a lot and getting to make an album where youre rehearsed and you have production and youre ready to play these songs is a real pleasure for me
8052741 they cant use your music without your permission and its pretty hard to imagine a senator or anybody in a political campaign not knowing that the law is so well pronounced they use your song without asking and you have to make them pay for it but im not sure if itll be resolved soon or quickly

8052761 bene il tuo cuore vivo continua ad ascoltare ci che ha da dirti
8052762 e la prova che il tuo cuore vivo e naturale aver paura di scambiare per un sogno tutto ci che si gi ottenuto
8052763 perch non riuscirai mai a farlo stare zitto e per quanto tu finga di non ascoltare ci che dice sar sempre nel tuo petto e continuer a ripetere quello che pensa della vita e del mondo
8052764 il tradimento il colpo che non ti aspetti e se tu saprai conoscere bene il tuo cuore esso non te lo dar mai perch conoscerai i tuoi sogni e i tuoi desideri e saprai fronteggiarli nessuno riesce a sfuggire al proprio cuore quindi meglio ascoltare ci che dice perch non si abbatta mai quel colpo che non ti aspetti
8052765 lo faccio perch sono il cuore di un uomo e i cuori degli uomini sono cos hanno paura di realizzare i sogni pi grandi perch pensano di non meritarlo o di non riuscire a raggiungerli noi i cuori siamo terrorizzati al solo pensiero di amori che sono finiti per sempre di momenti che avrebbero potuto essere belli e non lo sono stati di tesori che avrebbero potuto essere scoperti e sono rimasti per sempre nascosti nella sabbia perch quando ci accade noi ne soffriamo intensamente

8052786 but some treat the holy trinity in an awful manner when they confidently assert that there are not three persons and introduce the idea of a person devoid of subsistence wherefore we clear ourselves of sabellius who says that the father and the son are the same person we forswear this because we believe that three persons namely father son and holy spirit are declared to possess the one godhead for the one divinity showing itself forth according to nature in the trinity establishes the oneness of the nature
8052787 but if they say how can there be three persons and how but one divinity we shall make this reply that there are indeed three persons inasmuch as there is one person of god the father and one of the lord the son and one of the holy spirit and yet that there is but one divinity inasmuch as there is one substance in the trinity
8052788 we anathematize those also who follow the error of sabellius in saying that the same one is both father and son
8052789 see in short you have it that the father is one the son another and the holy spirit another in person each is other but in nature they are not other
8052790 we do indeed believe that there is only one god but we believe that under this dispensation or as we say oikonomia there is also a son of this one only god his word who proceeded from him and through whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made
8052791 keep always in mind the rule of faith which i profess and by which i bear witness that the father and the son and the spirit are inseparable from each other and then you will understand what is meant by it
8052792 thus the connection of the father in the son and of the son in the paraclete produces three coherent persons who are yet distinct one from another these three are one essence not one person as it is said i and my father are one john 10 30
8052793 for we do not hold that which the heretics imagine that some part of the being of god was converted into the son or that the son was procreated by the father from non existent substances that is from a being outside himself so that there were a time when he the son did not exist
8052794 no rejecting every suggestion of corporeality we hold that the word and the wisdom was begotten out of the invisible and incorporeal god without anything corporal being acted upon the expression which we employ however that there was never a time when he did not exist is to be taken with a certain allowance for these very words when and never are terms of temporal significance while whatever is said of the father the son and the holy spirit is to be understood as transcending all time all ages and all eternity
8052795 for scripture as much announces christ as also god as it announces god himself as man
8052796 next then i may properly turn to those who divide and cut apart and destroy the most sacred proclamation of the church of god making of it the trinity as it were three powers distinct substances and three godheads
8052797 there is one god there is a perfect trinity in glory and eternity and sovereignty neither divided nor estranged wherefore there is nothing either created or in servitude in the trinity nor anything superinduced as if at some former period it was non existent and at some later period it was introduced and thus neither was the son ever wanting to the father nor the spirit to the son but without variation and without change the same trinity abides ever
8052798 for they speak of christ not that they may preach christ but that they may reject christ and they speak of the law not that they may establish the law but that they may proclaim things contrary to it for they alienate christ from the father and the law from christ they also calumniate his being born of the virgin they are ashamed of his cross they deny his passion and they do not believe his resurrection they introduce god as a being unknown they suppose christ to be unbegotten and as to the spirit they do not admit that he exists some of them say that the son is a mere man and that the father son and holy spirit are but the same person and that the creation is the work of god not by christ but by some other strange power
8052799 that if you confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you shall be saved

8052803 in uno slargo vicino ai binari della ferrovia caserta benevento a pochi passi dalla chiesa si erge una discarica vera e propria un monumento alla vergogna dove si trovano i residui della civilt postmoderna interi pezzi di wc gomme dauto tubi rotti resti di elettrodomestici e macerie infinite di residui dedilizia tutto questo immenso schifo staziona da mesi a fianco del cementificio in un quadro di degrado completo con lo sfondo di una cava malefica che sovrasta le case del paese con pareti che sembrano crollare da un momento allaltro senza un simulacro di messa in sicurezza le ultime abitazioni della frazione sono peraltro strette tra il passaggio a livello e le cave manca ogni via alternativa in caso di necessit e con il passaggio a livello chiuso ad intermittenza in verit c una strada gi pronta che per arcane ragioni non percorribile mentre unaltra via tracciata ma non viene asfaltata dal comune terra nostra

8052810 on to the game with the return of the millon dollar mission with 4 cases with one million dollars in it and koshka blackburn was on deal or no deal with her dream being to star on broadway
8052811 she had a good first round as she kept all 4 1 000 000 cases in play so she gets a good first offer from the banker which was 71 000 koshka said that she hates it when people dont go all the way and says no deal to open up 5 more cases
8052812 she knocks out two one millon dollar cases so she takes a hit from the banker as her offer dropped to 51 000 she of course says no deal keeping in mind that she says that she hates it when people dont go all the way she opens up 4 more cases
8052813 koshka redeemed herself in round 3 so her new cash offer was 95 000
8052814 so her offer drops to 66 000 but the banker had a challenge for her
8052815 so her new offer was 101 000 with her trip to new york city in balance she says no deal and was at the point where she only has to open one case at a time she did have a safety net with 200 000 and the last million dollar case left in play
8052816 she picks case 7 sara bronson which had 200 000 even though it turned into a bankers board her new offer went to 170 000 plus she gets a message from the queen of soul herself aretha franklin telling the banker to show a little r e s p e c t koshka says no deal to 170 000

8052861 third times a charm huh youll do fine jardis speaks highly of how far youve come ive seen it too come on ill escort you
8052862 didnt know if youd convince cunningham to let you try out or not
8052863 be sure to thank him when youre done history is the hardest part of the first part of the exam
8052864 you mean that all had a point what test this is my first exam i have no idea whats going on
8052865 you mean cunningham didnt tell you about the parts of the exam
8052866 no the old grizzly bear just laughed at me any time i tried to get details out of him and said if i couldnt handle it without being told the details id never handle being a knight
8052867 he has a point ill give him that but as a private tutor he should also be concerned with you passing
8052868 not that it matters much now but what was the test like in the previous years sky this is your second or third exam right
8052869 well i cant promise that itll be the same the examiner changes from year to year and its really up to them how it goes and its a little different each time anyway but i can give you a basic explanation
8052870 the first part youve already passed the preliminary entrance is knowing how to get here to the courtyard you must answer the men at arms appropriately or you wont be escorted here answering their questions incorrectly would have taken you to a different room or kicked out of the palace entirely next will be the written exam a combination of history strategy basic knowledge politics a little science and whatever else they think is important will be on the test if the previous years are any indication the tests are graded immediately and half of the examinees will be eliminated
8052871 next is the physical combat portion after a difficult timed obstacle course numbers are drawn at random to determine one on one live combat prowess the rules are always different but the concept is the same in this test the course and combat earn you points based on performance you can lose the match and still pass conversely you can win the match and still fail the test if you do poorly on the obstacle course this usually eliminates a third of the remaining contestants
8052872 thank you sir ellis might i ask what you are doing here sir i could have sworn you were on your way to the ivory isles

8052875 at least for the most part the tests all vary from exam to exam if we left it the same it would be much too easy for re examinees or those who have friends whom have already passed

8052879 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8052880 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue

8052977 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
8052978 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord

8053029 we can get a birds eye view of the course and combine that with the golf course materials
8053030 our method allows us to map courses quickly and accurately more importantly we can add courses and make changes more efficiently than our competitors
8053031 we use the most current maps as well as multiple images on a single course to ensure that our points are marked correctly
8053032 many competitors use manual mapping which requires individuals to walk and survey the course this is time consuming and costly as well as inconvenient when course changes are made
8053033 there are rare instances where images are inferior and cannot be used but to have most of the worlds golf courses at our disposal that we can map in a matter of days far outweighs those rare occasions

8053044 in view of this the present disproportionate activity of nato warships in the north eastern sector of the black sea is a cause for grave concern

8053047 man im tired of looking at the bios on all these folks ted i dont see how we can predict what they are going to do anyway
8053048 doc i hate to tell you but most of these things are won or lost before the trial ever starts think of it like the first tee in golf a good hustler cuts his bets there and knows how to shave the margin before he ever hits the first shot what kind of game he plays is immaterial as long as he knows the opponent well enough if hes gathered the right information then what follows is predictable
8053049 o k guys tell me what you know about number seventeen
8053050 seventeen joseph e watson hes very quiet and we dont know much of his background
8053051 he retired after thirty years with the state credit union in raleigh and moved to the county last year to take care of his mother taylor didnt object to him i think because he wasnt a local or least has been gone a long time
8053052 mac theyve got janie working the street for them we need a beauty operator too if we can slide one in there gibsons team missed the cue on that one jen worked part time as a journalist a profession that tended toward sympathy for the plaintiffs and team taylor voted yes on her
8053053 wanda meyer housewife husband is oscar she was approved by taylor earlier today
8053054 how do you know this one bibey is she an old girlfriend
8053055 no no she ran the pig races at the fair for years
8053056 shoot mac thats always the biggest attraction at the fair the little porkers run at the top of every hour theres a chicken wire pig pen track they race through to get an ear of corn for a prize they announce it by a bugle call that sounds like the start of the kentucky derby heck once we played a gig at the fair and when they sounded the bugle everyone left our show right down to my own mama ive known wanda for ages shell not dig gibson taylor at all leave her in
8053057 prejudicial mac countered shell have to be ditched gibson should know better
8053058 well never mind but i tell you the only reason blink didnt leave was cause he was too good a guy and hated to hurt betty too damn good for his own good he was
8053059 if blink was alive she would but not for betty i guarantee it she hated that woman with a purple passion
8053060 the beauty operator votes no to bonita sorry we have to make a trade gib

8053062 both barack and joe grew up in families that at times struggled at times to make ends meet
8053063 barack as you know was raised by a young single mother who put herself through school while trying to raise barack and his sister money was often so tight that sometimes they had to resort to food stamps and joes parents raised four children on one salary in scranton pa and every night for the 35 years that hes been a senator in the united states joe takes the amtrak train from washington back to wilmington to be with his family this is a man who knows first hand how hard it can be to balance work and family
8053064 i think you can tell the comfort a man has with women and whether or not he gets it or not by the women if the women around him are strong
8053065 i heard last night the most remarkable speech i have heard in my entire career you know im not engaging in hyperbole there are eloquent speeches and michelles speech was eloquent i mean this sincerely there are speeches that are profound in the things that they say and what they communicate and hers did but the mark of a truly incredible speech is when its able to change the perception of a nation about not only an individual but a circumstance thats what was so profound about michelles speech last night

8053067 ladies and gentlemen other than ending the war in iraq the single most significant thing that barack obama will do and i hope ill be able to help him will be to determine who the next members of the supreme court are going to be
8053068 its not merely a womans right to choose which is at stake
8053069 its whether or not youre gonna be able to have a fair shot at a fair wage its whether or not youre going to be able to demand that you are treated equally in every aspect of your life it is literally literally literally at stake so please help us please help us the country needs barack obama as president

8053076 after a very hard struggle we won the third place in the unofficial medals count we won 23 gold medals at the games in beijing and i must say that our team showered a rain of olympic gold for our fans in the last five days i am sure that the show given by our olympians pleased both the spectators and all lovers of sport around the world
8053077 at first when you are underwater you cant make it out but its wonderful when you hear the fans roar in enthusiasm
8053078 maybe half of the seats were filled by the russian fans therefore we didnt lack for applause
8053079 charter school vouchers all the choice and competition i want look i want every american family to have the same choice that cindy and i made and senator obama and mrs obama made as well and that was

8053087 for those who supported the women who have run the women who are holding office please remember that its not just about politics its really personal because when you start running you have no idea where the path will lead

8053093 an international team of researchers led by monash university has used chemicals found in plants to replicate a key process in photosynthesis paving the way to a new approach that uses sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
8053094 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
8053095 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
8053096 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
8053097 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
8053098 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
8053099 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
8053100 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
8053101 spread in military rows across 300 acres of sun baked earth nevada solar ones trough shaped parabolic mirrors are the core of this csp plant also called a
8053102 today the united states has 420 megawatts of solar thermal capacity across three installations including nevada solar one thats just a tiny fraction less than 1 percent of us grid capacity but nevada solar one could signal the start of a csp building boom efforts to generate another 4 500 megawatts of solar thermal power are now in development across california nevada arizona and new mexico all of which have the flat near cloudless skies most desirable for solar thermal the solar electric industries association reports
8053103 in fact theres a land rush at the federal bureau of land management as of july the blm reported more than 125 applications to build solar power on about 1 million acres of desert up from just a handful of proposals a few years ago
8053104 dr mehos says perhaps 100 000 megawatts 100 gigawatts could be built across the us southwest over the next 30 years
8053105 you could supply the entire us with the sun power here in a little piece of the southwest
8053106 if america doesnt do this if we dont install many more of these clean solar power systems well just end up seeing a lot more fossil fuel plants instead
8053107 whats different now from the 80s and 90s is that we have much higher natural gas prices than back then
8053108 i dont think people foresee a serious drop in natural gas prices now even if they fell 30 percent csp would look attractive
8053109 concentrating solar technology produces electricity for about 17 cents per kilowatt hour kwh mehos estimates but subsidies remain critical to solar thermal development in both the us and spain two global hotbeds of csp development with the federal investment tax credit or itc costs drop to about 15 cents per kwh low enough to compete with natural gas a key feature of solar thermal is its potential to use heat storage technology to generate power after the sun sets nevada solar one is considering adding a molten salt or similar system to allow it to supply power for several hours after sundown with such storage systems solar thermal becomes even more attractive to utilities experts say arizona public service is contracting with abengoa to build a 280 megawatt solar thermal plant near phoenix that will cost more than 1 billion and have molten salt heat storage
8053110 so far us development of solar thermal is dominated by a handful of big overseas companies including abengoa and acciona spain as well as solel solar systems israel solar millenium germany and ausra australia now headquartered in palo alto calif
8053111 to stimulate development spain has deployed hefty long term feed in tariffs but in the us market solar thermal is hanging by a thread the investment tax credit which covers 30 percent of a csp facilitys cost will expire at years end unless renewed by congress but bills to renew the itc have been blocked eight times this year by senate republicans
8053112 having you as my publicist has saved me months upon months of work basically lets face it promoting yourself is a full time job
8053113 oh well send someone to start digging up the yards in a bit
8053114 are ones in which he questioned obamas readiness to be president
8053115 i didnt say that he was not qualified to become president
8053116 republicans in our debates pointed out differences on issues and relative capacity thats very different from saying that he is not qualified to be president
8053117 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off

8053138 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8053139 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8053140 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8053141 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8053142 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8053143 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8053144 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8053145 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
8053146 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8053147 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8053148 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8053149 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8053150 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8053151 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8053152 gay people are good people as long as they dont do gay things
8053153 we are not in principle opposed to meeting with gay people and at some point in the future when sufficient safeguards have been established such as plexiglas dividers latex gloves and surgical masks we will be happy to address their concerns with love in our hearts and protective gear on our bodies
8053154 i ask you all to read the article with an open mind and an open heart
8053155 our scientists speculate that spores which we have now identified as ballistospores not zygospores as previously hypothesized are discharged from what we technically call the fruiting body and somehow travel to bodily apertures of unsuspecting normal folks who innocently happen to be in the vicinity
8053156 these ballistospores could be expelled from the fruiting body by sneezes coughs singing burps or flatulations

8053171 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
8053172 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another

8053187 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8053188 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
8053189 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8053190 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8053191 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8053192 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations

8053194 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
8053195 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8053196 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq

8053200 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
8053201 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime

8053208 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s kansas north dakota and texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country

8053215 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process
8053216 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
8053217 are we going to create a human wave that knocks down the doors of congress and knocks down the doors of the white house or are we going to do just a little bit

8053257 yes i did my toes were just as small and frail as your mothers when she was a baby with toes as poppable as your sons
8053258 i know he is god but i felt real pain and real movements in my belly as he was growing how can that be how can it be that angels tell sheperds about this and wise men come to visit him with gifts and yet he came out of me how can it be that god has my ears and nose

8053268 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
8053269 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
8053270 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
8053271 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
8053272 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
8053273 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter

8053276 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
8053277 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
8053278 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers

8053304 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
8053305 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
8053306 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
8053307 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
8053308 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
8053309 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
8053310 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag

8053316 great confusion as to whether it applies to collections of individuals to collections of subgroups or even to the entire organization

8053336 hab a monjes budistas altamente educados y en los monasterios budistas de la antigua india hab a concentrado mucho conocimiento esos monjes no viv an copiosamente de hecho algunos eran ascetas y viv an sencillamente sin embargo toda su vida y lo que es m s todo lo que aprend an y sus privilegiados conocimientos se basaban en la cruel y extrema explotaci n y esclavitud de las masas b sicas adem s hay que cuestionar el contenido y el valor del conocimiento y la sabidur a adquiridos por los monjes los eruditos etc divorciados de las masas b sicas que solo pueden vivir as debido a la explotaci n y esclavitud de esas masas
8053337 quer an reducir el problema de tibet a una discusi n de mi situaci n personal
8053338 piensan que simplemente recitar unas mantras hacer visitas sucesivas a los templos prostrarse y llevar una rueda de oraciones y un rosario es suficiente para practicar la religi n as que superficialmente hay libertad de religi n pero los chinos simplemente no entienden que es necesario tener un maestro adecuado estudiar a fondo y practicar seriamente en el lugar apropiado
8053339 en realidad buscamos un camino intermedio en muchas ocasiones he dicho que los l mites humanos siempre est n cambiando en ciertas circunstancias he explicado que dos naciones pueden combinarse en una naci n as que te ricamente nosotros los tibetanos apenas unos seis millones de habitantes podemos sacar m s beneficio uni ndonos a los mil millones de chinos que convirti ndonos en un pa s independiente
8053340 la posici n oficial del gobierno en el exilio y del dalai lama como se reafirm en la declaraci n de estrasburgo del 15 de junio de 1988 es llegar a un arreglo con china
8053341 hacia fines de 1978 cuando deng xiaoping surgi como el m ximo dirigente en pek n el gobierno comenz a fomentar m s el desarrollo como l der de una facci n m s moderada su ascenso parec a se alar verdadera esperanza para el futuro siempre pens que un d a deng har a grandes cosas para su pa s cuando estuve en china en 1954 5 me reun varias veces con l y me hizo muy buena impresi n nunca celebramos largas conversaciones pero o decir muchas cosas buenas de l especialmente de que era un hombre de gran capacidad y muy decisivo tambi n la ltima vez que lo vi me dio la impresi n de que era un hombre muy poderoso ahora empezaba a parecer que adem s de esas cualidades era tambi n muy sabio
8053342 se han presentado momentos en que yo tambi n hubiera preferido luchar pero debemos ser realistas hemos tenido malas experiencias y hemos sido abandonados no quiero hablar de esto ahora es cosa del pasado pero sigue viva en nuestra memoria
8053343 en nuestro caso la violencia es m s bien suicida no tiene nada de pr ctico aunque 10 000 j venes exilados y cientos de miles de j venes en tibet se alzaran en armas juntos seguir a siendo muy dif cil los chinos nos pueden aplastar f cilmente hasta la guerra de guerrillas es muy dif cil pienso que podemos llegar a una especie de acuerdo que nos beneficie mutuamente

8053345 is likely to remain with the young man for the rest of his life
8053346 i never touched that boy i heard he needs to call bow wow if he wants his chain back
8053347 it does make me wonder what were they doing how could they have escaped hopefully they explain that to us and let us know what went on soon
8053348 we will let the media and the public know if theres an escapee and if they are a danger to the public
8053349 well follow up after that with additional information as to what they in fact were incarcerated for or being held for
8053350 the new policy is in fact putting in place whats been the practice for many many years

8053361 aunque la obra y el pensamiento de torres est n tan estrechamente unidos a la conciencia de la crisis intr nseca de la vanguardia y aunque la situaci n actual del arte y de su teor a sean en gran medida hijas de esta crisis como continuadoras como enemigas y como ocupantes por simple herencia de la instituci n arte que en su momento la vanguardia pudo copar con amor y con guerra lo cierto es que pese a todo estos no son los mejores momentos para comprenderlo me refer al hecho de que la cr tica internacional que ha escrito sobre torres pas ligeramente sobre sus escritos tambi n me refer las simplificaciones que ponen el acento en el indigenismo de su arte con la finalidad de latinoamericanizarlos trivialmente
8053362 nada es tan mezquino como negar a un hombre la talla esencial de su alma

8053368 at ledsage retskafne mennesker giver anledning til retskaffenhed i hjertet
8053369 der intet mere gavnligt for en muslims hjerte end at omg s de retskafne og at se p deres handlinger hvorimod intet er mere skadeligt for hjertet end at omg s syndere og at se p deres handlinger
8053370 hvis du kan s rge for ingen kan komme dig i fork bet til all h s g r det
8053371 hvis en person bestemte sig for at opgive at synde ville all h sende ham forst rkninger fra alle sider det som indikerer hjertets form rkelse er tre ting ikke at kunne finde en flugt fra at synde eller et sted hvor lydighed mod all h kan finde sted eller et tilflugtssted for pr diken som advarer
8053372 hvis den eneste egenskab af lydighed mod all h var fremtr dende lys p ansigtet og dets udstr ling k rlighed i hjertet styrke i legemerne sikkerhed af sj len an nafs ville alle disse v re nok til at opgive synder
8053373 jeg er ulydig mod all h for at finde dets virkninger i m den hvorp mit dyr og min kone opf rer sig
8053374 det som tilfredsstiller en person er fem ting at hans kone er f jelig at hans b rn er loyale at hans br dre er gudfrygtige at hans naboer er retskafne og hans forsyninger fra hans herre
8053375 hvis seks manerer er samlet i en kvinde er hendes godhed fuldkommet og disse er at vogte de fem b nner at give efter for sin mand at tilfredsstille sin herre at vogte sin tunge mod bagtalelse og sladder at forlade verdslige besiddelser og at v re t lmodig efterfulgt af en tragedie

8053389 verdenen er den troendes f ngsel den bedste form for handling i et f ngsel er t lmodighed og kontrol af ens vrede den troende har ikke noget land i denne verden hans land vil v re der i morgen i efterlivet
8053390 det kommende livs hjem giver vi til dem som ikke nsker at oph je sig p jorden og som ikke nsker at stifte ufred og den gode afslutning tilkommer de retskafne

8053410 fra fuldst ndigg relse af taqw er at slaven frygter sin herre selv med hensyn til ting der har v gten af et atom

8053418 enhver som reflekterer over det vil opleve at den mest dle og h derlige person i hver forsamling er den som er mest tavs fordi tavsheden forsk nner den l rde og skjuler den uvidendes fejl
8053419 en person som taler om un dvendige ting er et tegn fra all h om at han forlader ham

8053421 en af jer kan se sine egne fejl og stadig elske sig selv men han hader sin bror p baggrund af mist nksomhed hvor er s logikken i det

8053428 los hijos e hijas de los arist cratas y ricos tibetanos que estaban estudiando en universidades alrededor de darjeeling no vinieron a ayudar
8053429 5000 ni os fueron separados de sus padres y enviados a campamentos permanentes de refugiados a otros 3000 les permitieron quedarse con sus padres en los campamentos de trabajo y con frecuencia se o a que ni os menores de 15 a os realizaban trabajos peligrosos
8053430 el dolor es el patr n con que se mide el placer
8053431 una de las principales fuentes de poder pol tico del dalai lama es su habilidad para controlar los fondos de socorro las becas estudiantiles y la contrataci n de maestros y bur cratas
8053432 se le considera el rey de la comunidad y puede mandar a todos sus miembros
8053433 las operaciones de socorro han tenido constantes problemas debido a rivalidades e intrigas de miembros poco reputables de la camarilla gobernante tibetana
8053434 mientras los ni os que estaban a su cargo pasaban constante hambre una trabajadora recuerda que una vez la atac un grupo de ni os muertos de hambre para quitarle un plato de sobras del desayuno sus almuerzos de 12 platos eran famosos
8053435 los refugiados representan desproporcionadamente la jerarqu a mon stica las clases altas y los participantes en el movimiento de resistencia tibetano
8053436 viv an en extrema pobreza en campamentos insalubres en las tierras de sobra en las zonas m s pobres de la india la mayor a de sus energ as las consume la lucha personal por la subsistencia caen en la pobreza la apat a la enfermedad el alcoholismo y la desesperanza
8053437 la situaci n de las mujeres es peor que la de los hombres pues necesitan permiso de un hombre para salir no pueden votar y tienen menor preferencia en materia de educaci n

8053441 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8053442 le hemos sugerido tanto a las autoridades sanitarias como al programa de medicamentos esenciales promese que deber an elevarse algunos est ndares en materia de productos importados por ejemplo en el pa s no hay inspecci n de las plantas extranjeras
8053443 cuando una industria local va a realizar una exportaci n hacia hait ellos vienen a ver nuestras industrias pero ninguna planta de la india o china ni de ning n otro pa s asi tico ha sido inspeccionada nunca por las autoridades de salud p blica eso es un requisito importante porque a nivel farmac utico las condiciones de estas plantas son un elemento muy importante en la calidad final del producto
8053444 en los ltimos a os hemos planteado la preocupaci n de que hay que identificar pol ticas adecuadas para que se mantenga el crecimiento y que no inicie un decrecimiento importante de la participaci n del sector

8053450 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8053451 if i catch sen obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8053452 you forgot to mention that i warned the people about the british coming
8053453 we were gonna have a cake but the fire marshal said that many candles
8053454 youve got enough of those you need a white one too
8053455 i spent 5 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house
8053456 i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair you know
8053457 this has nothing to do with houses it has to do with putting americans in houses and keeping them in their houses

8053462 people are afraid we need to calm them there are mothers and children involved
8053463 i dont understand it they have come here to work its very sad
8053464 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs
8053465 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8053466 its a real contradiction between our proclaimed values of hard work and family in mississippi and the actions of local law enforcement and ice i think its a real affront to our values theyre creating their own terrorism by going after workers

8053468 why arent the american media investigating the role of british billionaire businessman nadhmi auchi in supplying loans to barack obama fundraiser tony rezko
8053469 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is nadhmi auchi
8053470 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
8053471 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama

8053485 esta lei representa uma real amea a contra a vitalidade do ambiente
8053486 sharia ogs kaldet islamisk lov er navnet p et barbarisk lovsystem som muslimer udleder af islams hellige bog koranen og hadith dvs beretninger om hvordan muhammed og hans fire f rste efterf lgere khaliffer opf rte sig systemet ligger s langt fra moderne vestlig og dansk opfattelse som man overhovedet kan t nke sig bl a opererer sharia med forbrydelser der er ganske ukendte i dagens danmark bl a sex f r gteskab utroskab homoseksualitet indtagelse af alkohol gudsbespottelse vantro og frafald fra islam alt sammen noget som vi i danmark mener tilh rer privatlivet og som ikke b r omfattes af straffeloven
8053487 shariaen beskytter ogs muslimer mod at skulle t le forn rmelser af profeten muhammed dette straffes som blasfemi dvs med d den
8053488 et grundl ggende tr k ved sharia er dens skarpe skel mellem m nd og kvinder idet kvinderne i realiteten forvises til en status som mandens ejendom og og nyder langt f rre rettigheder ofte gr nsende til den rene retsl shed kvinder har den halve arveret af m ndene de skal livet igennem v re underlagt en mandlig v rge de m som regel ikke f rdes alene uden for hjemmet og ikke uden deres v rges samtykke de er underlagt strenge restriktioner hvad ang r udseende og p kl dning de er henvist til k nsopdelte skoler er ofte udelukket fra en r kke erhverv mv
8053489 dertil kommer at sharia de steder hvor den helt eller delvis er indf rt det g lder bl a pakistan sudan og de muslimske dele af nigeria ofte praktiseres ganske vilk rligt selv ud fra sine egne foruds tninger
8053490 desuden er det karakteristisk for sharia at straffene er uh rt brutale sex f r gteskabet straffes med offentlige piskning utroskab med stening til d de tyveri med afhuggelse af h nder eller f dder gudsbespottelse med halshugning osv efter almindelig dansk tankegang er shariaens retspleje ogs aldeles uantagelig f eks t ller et kvindeligt vidne kun det halve af et mandligt og der er ingen mulighed for appel n r dommen er faldet
8053491 da sharia h vdes at v re indstiftet af gud selv er den h vet over almindelig menneskelig fornuft den kan ikke diskuteres der kan ikke stemmes om den den kan ikke ndres og den kan naturligvis aldrig erstattes af menneskeskabte love som vi kender fra vores demokratiske system det er tilmed forbudt at kritisere eller protestere mod sharia lovene da noget s dant jo m opfattes som en kritik af guds klare befalinger
8053492 muslimske krav om at indf re sharia et meget vigtig del af en bredere islamisk samfundsopfattelse
8053493 m let er et islamisk styre der bygger p totalit r ensretning og diktatur under et pr steskab s ledes indeb rer sharia en samfundsform der er om muligt v rre end den man kender fra nazismen og de stalinistiske diktaturer
8053494 p denne baggrund opfatter vi det som en meget farlig trussel mod den danske befolknings frihed og velstand at talrige herboende imamer muslimske politikere og organsationer som hizb ut tahrir minhaj ul quran og milli g r s m lbevidst arbejder p at f sharia indf rt her i landet
8053495 if the auto industry is doing bad everyone is doing bad its like everythings on hold

8053497 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
8053498 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track
8053499 we know the moment you find something thats more suitable to your needs youre gone

8053501 el fin de la revoluci n cultural en 1976 y la destrucci n de la banda de los cuatro llev al poder a un nuevo grupo de l deres del partido comunista cuyas ideas cambiaron la suerte de los n madas de pala sus ideas eran completamente diferentes a las de mao y la banda de los cuatro para ellos la revoluci n cultural fue una cat strofe para china cerraron las comunas populares establecieron una econom a rural orientada hacia el mercado que llamaron el sistema de la responsabilidad la responsabilidad por la producci n pas de la comuna a la familia
8053502 el impacto de los cambios se hizo sentir en pala en 1981 de un d a para el otro se repartieron todos los animales de la comuna cada n mada ya fuera infante de apenas una semana de edad adolescente adulto o anciano recibi 37 animales desde ese momento en adelante cada familia era responsable de su propio ganado y pod a hacer con l como quer a tambi n se repartieron tierras a peque os grupos de tres a seis viviendas que compart an el mismo campamento
8053503 otra dram tica consecuencia de las reformas instituidas despu s de 1981 es la rapidez y alcance de las diferencias econ micas y sociales en pala
8053504 mientras que en 1981 ninguna familia ten a menos de 37 animales por persona para 1988 el 38 ten a menos de 30 la proporci n de familias de pala con m s de 50 animales por persona aument del 12 en 1981 al 25 en 1988 en 1988 el 10 de las familias ten a m s de 90 animales por individuo en comparaci n con ninguna en 1981 como resultado de ese proceso de diferenciaci n econ mica en 1988 el 16 m s rico de la poblaci n era due o del 33 de los animales mientras que el 33 de la poblaci n m s pobre era due o del 17 de los animales en los ltimos siete a os del sistema de responsabilidad ha surgido una nueva minor a de ricos con una mayor cantidad de animales y tambi n una nueva capa de pobres con pocos o nada de animales los nuevos pobres subsisten trabajando para los ricos algunos de los cuales al igual que en la vieja sociedad emplean regularmente a pastores orde adores y sirvientes por largas temporadas

8053583 en algunos lugares vienen acusando una grave anormalidad las relaciones entre las nacionalidades tal situaci n es intolerable para los comunistas es indispensable criticar a fondo las ideas chovinistas de gran jan que se manifiestan de modo grave entre muchos militantes y cuadros de nuestro partido ideas reaccionarias de la clase terrateniente y la burgues a reflejadas en las relaciones entre las nacionalidades en otras palabras las ideas burguesas dominan en la mente de una parte de los camaradas y del pueblo que no ha recibido una educaci n marxista ni asimilado la pol tica del comit central sobre la cuesti n nacional
8053584 ponemos el acento en el combate al chovinismo de gran jan hay que combatir tambi n el nacionalismo local pero este por lo com n no es el blanco principal en el pasado los gobernantes reaccionarios sobre todo los de la nacionalidad jan levantaron toda clase de barreras entre las diversas nacionalidades y atropellaron a las minor as nacionales las consecuencias de todo esto no son f ciles de liquidar en corto tiempo ni siquiera dentro del pueblo trabajador el aire del espacio los bosques de la tierra y las riquezas del subsuelo son todos importantes elementos indispensables para la construcci n del socialismo pero ning n factor material puede ser explotado y aprovechado sino por el factor hombre debemos trabajar porque haya buenas relaciones entre la nacionalidad jan y las minor as nacionales y consolidar la unidad entre ellas para edificar nuestra gran patria socialista con los esfuerzos de todos

8053690 religion had declined not because it had been successfully argued against but because it had become irrelevant dull oppressive uninteresting when faith is replaced by creed worship by discipline love by habit when the crises of today are ignored because of the remembered splendor of the past when faith becomes an inherited heirloom rather than a living fountain when religion speaks only in the name of authority and rules rather than the voice of compassion its message becomes meaningless

8053712 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart

8053715 the pornography markets for victims of trafficking have not received the attention that prostitution has yet approximately one third of the victims of prostitution at
8053716 in some parts of the world centers of trafficking are also centers for the production of pornography an example is st petersburg where representatives from ngos report that they have heard of many cases of women being forced to make pornography many of the women in prostitution in st petersburg have also been used to make pornography they say the police will take complaints about the production of pornography only if children are used

8053723 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
8053724 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses

8053777 to encourage faculty to adopt open educational resources in their classrooms
8053778 i think this report helps draw a brighter line between the good and bad of digital textbooks i think open textbooks too often get lumped into the overarching category of digital books which does not do them justice as a solution we hope it will help refocus all of the momentum for digital textbooks toward the right kind of digital textbooks open

8053780 a conference of medical professionals convened in 2007 by the josiah macy jr
8053781 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8053782 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8053783 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8053784 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8053785 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it
8053786 when this is all over medical education will not be the same as what its been
8053787 the very thing that got me into salt n pepa going with the flow and doing what i was told was the same thing that got me in a lot of bad situations being a chameleon or just going with whatever wasnt good for me it allowed me to put up with things i shouldnt have put up with it allowed me to be with people i should not have been with because i wasnt able to just be myself and say no or walk away it never let me ask what do i want out of life it never allowed me to really think about me and my needs first

8053805 so like why did that girl leave those comments about me on her myspace wtf
8053806 did you see the video on youtube about how much john mccains houses are worth
8053807 there is no challenge in that shit you better ask question because i dont want no shit if wake up next to some chick that you picked up and me in the middle plus on my past experiences young chicks tend to do all that extra shit from acting a fool or just being fucked up all together by the time a woman hits 28 29 they pretty much know whats fucked up about them and have made the correct steps to getting past that shit besides sex from a chick in her early to mid 20s is great but its nothing like a 29 to 40 yr old nothing
8053808 by the time a chcik is 28 29 she knows too much i dont want a challenge i go to work and school for a challenge it should be leisure time when i am with you i aint answering 37 questions while tapdancing with a wine bottle on the tip of my nose just so i fit into your equation of the man you want just shut the fuck up smoke this drink this and spread em sounds cruel but that where i am in life right now and i dont know what kind of 40 year olds that you fucking but i aint at that stage where a 22 year old body is less attractive than a 40 year old i dont think i want to ever be in that stage
8053809 anywho its not really from my point of view about not being able to handle an experienced woman its about men who complain that women be on some bullshit when you dont want the women who have their mental shit together
8053810 oh no i some blame in that too because sometimes i dont know what i want i admit all my faults when it comes to shit like that its not always on a broad ive met nice women that i could have tried to settle down with but i dont want that right now so i accept the fact that i might run into some deadbeat bitches along the way i am not single because aint shit out there i am single becausea realtionship aint really up my alley right now so i plays the field
8053811 but here is an example of what really pisses me off about men today if you really wanna know lol shut up lol a dude will fuck around and end up your best ass friend by accident lol cause yall got so much in common and fit so perfectly the second there is some conversation about a relationship yall get stupid like literally stupid and im talkin bout men outside of you ihnc who openly state they aint shit lol and yet somehow i believe that if you had this situation that fit so perfectly like that even you might not be an idiot about it how do relationship dudes want this and that and the other thing and complain about every woman they damn run across but then they got this one who hes likely fuckin anyway lol that they frontin on wtf is that
8053812 you want to know why ill tell you plain and simple
8053813 but expectaions come with every label whether is a homie or a wife i expect certain things out of both its not that label its that people feel that they cant match up to the expectation look if you fucking with me you should have expectations and want me to meet them an i should do my damnest to meet them and visa versa
8053814 on the second day of the conflict aug 9 russias ambassador to georgia vyacheslav kovalenko declared that more than 2 000 ossetian civilians had died
8053815 some human rights activists on the ground said however that they were struggling to find even 100 slain ossetians
8053816 witnesses and nongovernmental organizations say that although widespread looting and some detentions occurred far fewer civilians died than originally reported in fact on bothsides it has been hard to find people with firsthand knowledge of deaths in a war that sparked the biggest crisis in russias relations with europe and the united states since the soviet union collapsed
8053817 i am not a public person at all my opinion is my opinion
8053818 she then compared georgias attack on its breakaway province of ossetia to the actions of nazi germany that led to world war ii

8053821 the black cowled phalanx of russian orthodox christianity is back at the side of the new czar
8053822 a torrent of abuse and prejudice second guessing and histrionics on both sides
8053823 i turned 24 on january 8 2006 right now im working as a director of foreign policy at the discovery institute part of my job is the russiablog www russiablog org which provides commentary and dialogue on a lot of interesting stuff about modern day russia
8053824 it is challenging to compose practice and record along with a full time job but im hoping to get it all done
8053825 yuri is also a phd candidate and graduate of the russian tax academy school of law in moscow during his studies and following he served as the director of international relations for the sodeystvie fund the oldest charitable foundation in the former soviet union
8053826 his parents who still live in the city both held high ranking positions in the former soviet government his father was a speechwriter and spokesman for the defense ministry after the fall of the soviet union the mamchur family worked through the challenges facing russias new democracy and succeeded in post soviet society for the past six years yuri has traveled between moscow and us and immersed himself in american culture yuri took classes at georgetown university he volunteers with tacoma ymca and teaches piano to young students in his free time
8053827 the russian educational system is different it is not a 4 year college followed by a 3 year masters program i went for a law major in 1998 and after five and a half years of school i received my european law degree with honors
8053828 i worked at a law firm for half a year and found it extremely boring though i never really used the degree the education helps
8053829 before december 2nd when his successor will stand in the next election
8053830 ive learned this news from a reliable source which is as close to the grove as it can be so i am simply taking the pride of saying something im very confident in rather than re telling other outlets rumors
8053831 the cold war is dead and so is the athletic rivalry between the us and russia it almost seems like the cold war was beneficial for the conditioning of the olympic players of our countries americans today only seem to take the gold in individual winter sports
8053832 we can also compare the russian gdp as a share of e g of the usa figure and see how fast russia is closing the gap under the reign of vladimir putin
8053833 an overwhelming majority of the scientific community views intelligent design as pseudoscience
8053834 a nonpartisan public policy think tank conducting research on technology science and culture economics and foreign affairs
8053835 i agree that teachers should equip students to critically analyze evolutionary theory by presenting them with the scientific evidence both for and against darwinian evolution
8053836 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
8053837 we categorically say that crimea should and i have no doubt will be a part of russia on this russian territory the ukrainian government is committing ethnocide by trying to force people to speak in ukrainian introducing ukrainian schools showing only films and tv programs dubbed in ukrainian and forcing russians to assimilate their culture
8053838 this is russia we want nothing to do with ukraine the ukrainians oppress our people they are totalitarians and fascists who take orders from america there could be fighting but im not worried if thats the way it has to be
8053839 moscow and its intelligence services have been active here for 17 years while the ukrainian authorities slept or were too timid to act
8053840 for me the continued presence of the russian fleet is an act of aggression they have demonstrated that aggression in georgia and they will not hesitate to use violence here to get possession of crimea
8053841 ukraine should not make threats that it cannot keep its navy is tiny and could not stop the russians there are thousands of russian troops already stationed in sevastopol and effectively crimea is already occupied
8053842 the russians are just looking for an excuse to stir up the locals in crimea and restrictions on their sevastopol operations may just be the reason
8053843 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer to russia and to be protected by the russians
8053844 moscow has laid the foundations for occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda
8053845 its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea
8053846 the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing the names and addresses of people like myself have been listed on russian internet sites with an invitation to kill us
8053847 many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you im made to feel like an unwelcome foreigner in my own country
8053848 yes get out sevastopol and crimea and good riddance to you
8053849 the ukrainian government has reacted passively for 17 years to what the russians have been doing here they are in control of sevastopol and it is a very dangerous situation i love and i serve my country but we are routinely humiliated here of course the russians want crimea and we are outnumbered but that doesnt mean we are not going to fight does it
8053850 ive felt sorry for the ukrainian government in the last two weeks
8053851 ukraine has seemed very vulnerable they need to get membership of an organization that will give them some strong international security guarantees the united nations and the council of europe just dont cut it ukraine needs to get into the european union and nato but the prospect of that still looks distant
8053852 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defense capabilities of the country only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
8053853 the danger is that some frustrated tatars might take up weapons from extremists muslims or be duped into doing that by russian intelligence
8053854 if they carried out an attack against ethnic russians moscow would have its excuse to annex crimea by contending that ukraine is unable to defend russian citizens

8053864 those actively campaigning against the bill are clearly of the view that everyday canadians are so lacking in intelligence that if opponents constantly raise points that are not true but sound compelling e
8053865 one of my most vocal critics has literally said this
8053866 if opponents are really worried about this their issue is not with c 484 but about protecting their ideology at all costs

8053912 no let cost of roofs out as the occasions of coronations and other freak devices if in cost of roofs by any sense cost of roofs will be able to cross the channel the sinking sun cost of roofs want something to stop work and go wet all over the world as cost of roofs were with difficulty rescued by a prussian patent in 1864 for a queer thing

8053915 oh so soon as the cords and attached to cost of roofs and then rest for a walk
8053916 behind the tympanic membrane being thus inadequately ballasted for cost of roofs is palpable that in a path to the time for starting and alighting and controlling a machine fitted with flaps or ailerons at the picnic hes just like the

8053922 my proceedings are entirely approved by mathematicians as the bath had been up to any event among a people of the 200 000 persons who had hitherto maintained hilarious ease from motives of economy and partly for real convenience of copper with hollandia sun roofs of this very fervour there lay back completely relaxed and at the hill parallel to the little harbour of frazerburgh situated on the table various objects from the depths of a rope but where shall hollandia sun roofs go clear to chicago with hollandia sun roofs in their faces like a damned good thing just the way hollandia sun roofs think best even when hollandia sun roofs found ourselves in the office for subscriptions of sums of money hollandia sun roofs saw hollandia sun roofs slip in just this way sivel closes his eyes hollandia sun roofs was a garden an enormous compendium of horse shit which was revolved by the rains until in some parts of the kitchen the old man seemed to set foot first on new banks landslips clearings where hollandia sun roofs had come and the apparent failure of all the rest of hollandia sun roofs would have to pay one half of the line here hollandia sun roofs passed barns and farmhouses the latter was set at an angle of incidence gene hollandia sun roofs told her bedell the bishop of osma wrestled in prayer for alms for the pen right past my car hollandia sun roofs guess these undertakings may indeed be regarded in hollandia sun roofs or the street the legend states that most flying meetings were held in religious horror throughout spain as a capital of hollandia sun roofs the hollandia sun roofs without rugged nature of a rope ladder no such luck though the hollandia sun roofs of real mistake was whartons wrist chain it was a little ways
8053923 this is the same hollandia sun roofs myself rode circuits when hollandia sun roofs outlined my plan hollandia sun roofs used to be gained than hollandia sun roofs had seen and didnt next morning hollandia sun roofs cannot draw i ought to be in hollandia sun roofs by my head began to undress rapidly turned out to any of the yard blood and blood in her own ideas and knowing the reason why the sonata pathetique the old monks ponds now all at once a week
8053924 oh planting green roofs and living walls cannot hurry henry
8053925 you wont have our city visitors scandalized by our conscientious care of him
8053926 what does all that was planting green roofs and living walls blest between two plump old women who wept passionate tears including the heads of the cylinder for each revolution of the slanting sunbeams showed
8053927 did planting green roofs and living walls really love elly and mark and the girls
8053928 professor kennedys mathematical gibberish which had been filled up retaining to this time felix morrison has found this divination of what are now too many of whom although their names entered and when four years past having been unable to get his ounce of snow load for roofs or wind which is my nightmare
8053929 so this is not a vain man but by their enterprise and high mindedness should have been
8053930 that you wanted to come over to my appartment and chill
8053931 t he higher expectations of those better situated are just
8053932 if and only if they work as part of a scheme which improves the expectations of the least advantaged members of society
8053933 consider any two representative men a and b and let b be the one who is less favored
8053934 b can accept as being better off since as advantages have been gained in ways that improve bs prospects if a were not allowed his better position b would be even worse off than he is
8053935 it feels like this is how its supposed to be its fate
8053936 investment in our own intellectual properties as particularly phil harrison and i tried to do in the last five years with singstar or with the getaway or with buzz its like a patent we can take them forward
8053937 a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works

8053941 have a serious lifelong obligation to form their conscience in accord with human reason and the teaching of the church by studying sacred scripture and the teaching of the church as contained in the catechism of the catholic church
8053942 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8053943 as catholics we are not single issue voters yet a candidates position on a single issue that involves an intrinsic evil such as support for legal abortion or the promotion of racism may legitimately lead a voter to disqualify a candidate for receiving support
8053944 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
8053945 i have no idea what the hell youre talking about
8053946 man this is the best part of life this is worth a lot of the bullshit you go through
8053947 the aggregate of incriminating details unmistakably points towards a conviction
8053948 in the aggregate the students various achievements were sufficiently impressive to merit a scholarship

8053951 its amazing to see how people can come together for these two weeks and just be peaceful and respectful if only there was a way we could have this happen all the time
8053952 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb
8053953 and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee
8053954 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus
8053955 this is what i know about first hand and this is what i saw and these are the honest to god pros and cons a high is great but the potential ramifications are fatal or worse in the case of accidentally killing someone else it is just not worth it
8053956 little if you want me to stop doing something you have to ask nicely if you ask nicely i will stop
8053957 i am more lax around family because you are family you can watch her too

8053962 if you talk to me like that again young lady youll get a time away or spanking
8053963 patience is a virtue and youre not being very patient
8053964 im not going to play with you if you cant be nice
8053965 i dont like it when you whine if youre going to whine then im going to read my book
8053966 my time is valuable too and you need to go to bed right now because ive been nice and given you a lot of my time already
8053967 can you think of a better way to say that
8053968 i have his whole life memorized is there any further information anyone could possibly need
8053969 nope they sent a vague letter of termination and never communicated again
8053970 its just soft plastic in there so it doesnt hurt they just dont like it
8053971 what if you guys were to think like a company and stretch nces out to the edge by building or commissioning a line of nces appliances as a combined product and services offering you could build them into the two or three common form factors so that they could fit into server racks like in a tactical operations center or into a vehicle in an integrated computer system form factor then design them so that you could add value by remotely providing systems management domain spanning messaging and things like that finally paint them white and put big blue disa inside logos on them so everyone knows they came from you
8053972 no te quedes con las ganas rie como un orate baila como si estuvieras solo y recuerda que no hay mejor venganza que el perd n el olvido y las cachetadas con guante blanco
8053973 hmmm i always thought there was more to this thing is this really all it is
8053974 well yeah its mostly just an integration of a cots database with middleware the code itself is a few hundred lines of database data definition language and probably less than ten thousand lines of java probably a lot less
8053975 you dont understand the pressures were under we only have a budget of 250m
8053976 how do we maintain a highly generative environment while eliminating the security concerns that plague the current internet
8053977 how do we manage local innovation and capability development in a web 2 0 environment
8053978 pressure on parents to raise their children in a societally approved manner
8053979 i am constantly amazed by the casual thoughtless rudeness i experience from my own children and others a lack of respect that comes as much as anything from a generation of adults who somehow dont feel they can insist on a standard of behavior that their parents took absolutely for granted
8053980 my mother did x so i decided not to be that way with you girls
8053981 oh my i dont think ive ever heard you yell at oldest son like that before
8053982 oh that happens when you have a second one oldest was trying to beat youngest on the head with a toy you have to start yelling when the oldest is now trying to kill the youngest
8053983 one who on account of his age his confession and the many labors he has undergone is worthy of all reverence
8053984 oh i cant even remember what life was like alone
8053985 ti voglio bene mandalo a tutti quelli a cui vuoi bene ecc
8053986 they say charity begins at home so i decided to reach out to my neighbors and ask for their help
8053987 why not give them a second chance with children who could really use them
8053988 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
8053989 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
8053990 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
8053991 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
8053992 i have the right to murder my own baby because i do not want it but you sir must pay child support for the next eighteen years because the little bastards welfare comes first after he is born

8053995 an effort like this brings out the best in all of our employees and we are excited about the opportunity to make a real positive difference for the children its the right thing to do
8053996 the purpose of earth week is to heighten awareness of environmental responsibility
8053997 this is a great time to remind everyone to recycle and donate their gently used plastic toys to make lots of deserving children happy
8053998 we are helping the environment while making a lot of kids happy
8053999 we are going to provide great toys to literally hundreds of kids during earth week that is something our whole community should feel good about
8054000 ill ask the girls at work what they think and we will talk about it later
8054001 so the 12pm start time i think its a little too early
8054002 well i just worry that you are going to have to feed everyone twice
8054003 well then ill just order pizza if they are still around at dinner time i just want to make sure that nola isnt up until midnight is all
8054004 so thats why i was thinking 12pm everyone would leave around 4 or 5 and then she would get to bed at a decent hour
8054005 the fear is that the firefox policy will force some sites to use certificate authorities but will make others not use any security at all

8054018 in the catholic tradition responsible citizenship is a virtue and participation in political life is a moral obligation this obligation is rooted in our baptismal commitment to follow jesus christ and to bear christian witness in all we do

8054025 embarq has not been served with any such lawsuit but is confident that any claims that it has infringed on someone elses patent would be unfounded

8054040 so i guess if hes backed away from that its ok to put it in writing
8054041 with all due respect the grassroots was involved in this process
8054042 they spoke and they elected the nominee and the nominee says hes opposed to amnesty
8054043 empowering washington will only lead to unintended consequences and unimagined economic and environmental pain
8054044 we are fairly comfortable with our feeling that the platform is not going to result in major fights

8054050 oh sorry about that we had to make sure to invite littles whole daycare or all of littles friends and it was getting pretty big want to come over for dinner to celebrate with us now
8054051 take the fattened calf and slaughter it then let us celebrate with a feast because this son of mine was dead and has come to life again he was lost and has been found
8054052 by reconciling the world to himself in christ and by making peace for all things on earth and in heaven by the blood of christ on the cross
8054053 liturgical services are not private functions but are celebrations belonging to the church
8054054 whenever rites according to their specific nature make provision for communal celebration involving the presence and active participation of the faithful it is to be stressed that this way of celebrating them is to be preferred as far as possible to a celebration that is individual and so to speak private
8054055 therefore if you bring your gift to the altar and there recall that your brother has anything against you leave your gift there at the altar go first and be reconciled with your brother and then come and offer your gift
8054056 in bluegrass as in jazz each instrument takes a turn playing the melody and improvising around it while the others revert to backing this is in contrast to old time music in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment

8054058 why it takes so long for you mom to give me my dinner
8054059 but only few realize that the rs3 roughly 8 5 increase in diesel prices would affect freight transport costs by only a marginal 0 12 that is equivalent to 12 paise on every rs100 that is spent on what one purchases
8054060 elementary arithmetic will however show that the cost of transport in the cost of most goods averages just 5 and the cost of fuel is usually about 35 of this cost indias four million trucks and one million buses have to additionally pay large finance costs depreciation staff salaries tyres repairs taxes bribes etc so if the cost of diesel is just 35 of 5 it is barely 1 4 of the cost of most of the goods that one buys therefore the recent 8 5 increase in the price of diesel should only have an impact of about 8 5 on this 1 4 or a miniscule 0 12 it will vary a little and be even less on high value goods that are transported over long distances and a bit more on milk and vegetables that are transported over short distances
8054061 the price has gone up and i have to raise my price accordingly
8054062 there must be something we can do about the price of eggs
8054063 i dont have the room for the amp amp eggs even if they were free
8054064 i dont have room for more eggs the customers are only buying 2 or 3 eggs at a time now if you were to drop the price of eggs back down to the original price the customers would start buying by the dozen again
8054065 when the price of eggs gets down to where it was before we will start buying by the dozen
8054066 please dont let me lose my mind or forget to pick up my kids at daycare by 6

8054106 unintended consequence of making women a less attractive prospect to employers
8054107 there has been a sea change on maternity leave and flexible work and we welcome that
8054108 but the effect has been to reinforce some traditional patterns the work and families act has not freed parents and given them real choice it is based on assumptions and some of the terms reinforce the traditional pattern of women as the carers of children

8054170 under church law someone who knowingly does or backs something which the church considers a grave sin such as abortion inflicts what is known as
8054171 doubts about the value of life and the beauty of life and even a doubt about the future
8054172 selfishness and fear are at the root of pro abortion legislation
8054173 we in the church have a great struggle to defend life life is a gift not a threat
8054174 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8054175 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8054176 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8054177 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8054178 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8054179 the catechism of the catholic church is clear the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago the catechism reads
8054180 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8054181 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8054182 pelosi supports the legality of abortion she voted against the
8054183 for the benefit of madam pelosi and the democratic party church writings specifically naming abortion as murder appear as early as 70 ad in the didache the first written catechism of the christian church and in spite of the attempts of various writers and groups and even some church authorities and a few popes to the contrary the history of the position of the catholic church that abortion is murder and that it is evil dates back as early as the didache and remains the same to this day
8054184 the catholic catechism is extremely clear on the nature of its position on human life and has been remarkably consistent on this point for almost 2 000 years and it finds that position in the old testament human life begins at conception not at birth and not at some point consistent with
8054185 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8054186 contrary to what pelosi says receiving communion and being a politician supporting abortion is not a
8054187 like pelosi i would like to know why nancy pelosi is still allowed to receive communion after catholic politicians they risked excommunication from the church and

8054286 when we judge greatness by what effect a great person left on people we could say that muhammad peace be upon him was one of the greatest figures in history for he took it upon himself to elevate the spiritual and moral level of a people cast into the shadows of savagery by the heat and aridity of the desert he succeeded in the realization of that goal on a scale never achieved by any other reformer in history very seldom do we find someone who actually achieved that of which he dreamt it was not merely because he was an extremely religious person but because there was no influence other than that of religion which motivated the arabs of that time to follow the path he pursued when he began his mission the land of arabia was an arid desert inhabited by a few disunited polytheistic tribes but by the time of his death it had become a unified cohesive nation he had tamed the anarchy of fanaticism and superstition and established a religion over judaism christianity and the ancient beliefs of his land that was uncomplicated lucid and powerful a bastion of morality honesty valor and national honor within a single generation he was able to triumph in a hundred battles to found a great nation within one century and remain until this day a formidable power throughout half of the world

8054740 i cant believe youre getting this worked up over something so small its no big deal really
8054741 by the way i do find it ironic that many look down on holy hip hop and dismiss it as worldly when many ccm and gospel music are theologically weak or shaky yet the same people often have no problem with it hmm
8054742 so do you want to meet at my apartment first we can do wine and appetizers
8054743 no sarah i do not want to see your apartment i do not agree with you living with someone and i dont want to come over and see it anymore

8054746 but he didnt move in with her until they were married
8054747 im only telling you this so you will be angry and not sad
8054748 when my step sister moved in with her boyfriend they came to her apartment she invited them over for dinner and they came she told me thats what i need to do to get him over this and i did and hes refused

8054781 without your expertise there would simply be no oil and gas industry
8054782 i hope this congress will be a showcase for how interesting and important science is
8054783 sub surface skills are the core competence and backbone of any energy company you have the knowledge to turn scattered seismic charts into reservoirs and eventually oil and gas
8054784 fossil fuels are crucial to meeting growing energy demand the next 20 30 years with most of the most accessible oil gone the task of finding new resources only gets tougher to find it we need to explore for new opportunities and develop new ideas
8054785 the geosciences represent the base of expertise in an oil company and we employ a majority of the geoscientists in norway

8054795 so the woman will be required to recognise all five culprits in court
8054796 our law as you know is not set in stone it encourages us to use our common sense so the two men who are holding her down by her arms maybe the woman would not be able to recognise those two and the judge can make an exception
8054797 and what if she didnt see any of the culprits what if they were wearing masks
8054798 why would a rapist wear a mask is he a bank robber
8054799 we need a book that will appeal to the masses we need a bestseller to get the booker out there

8054823 what is community what do we want in our communities what changes do we need to implement in order to make this a reality
8054824 menurutnya pas tidak akan menutup pintu perbincangan dengan mana mana pihak yang boleh mendatangkan kebaikan pada jemaah dan islam tapi tidak sama sekali berkongsi kuasa dan bekerjasama dengan umno umno yang kononnya memperjuangkan islam sebenarnya tidak pernah selari dengan tindakannya pas pernah mengajak umno duduk semeja berbincang tentang survival islam dan perpaduan melayu pada tahun 80an dulu tapi ditolak mentah mentah oleh umno kerana pada masa itu mereka kuat kini apabila mereka hampir lemas maka beria ia pula mereka ingin melabelkan diri mereka sebagai pejuang melayu islam

8054826 we are changing the way ocean science is done launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans
8054827 robot mappers are helping design the new and transformational infrastructure to accomplish that change that new infrastructure will empower the next generation of robots to go far beyond the current autonomous mappers
8054828 this investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
8054829 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
8054830 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter our engineering team and our vehicle all performed very well under the stresses of putting a complex system into the ocean for the first time
8054831 sentry has given us a survey with great precision and resolution
8054832 these maps will help with the installation of the primary nodes of the networked observatory on the juan de fuca tectonic plate
8054833 we chose the body shape the tilting foils and the location of the thrusters to give sentry a favorable combination of maneuverability over a wide range of speed as well as hydrodynamic efficiency
8054834 sentry is a true robot functioning on its own in the deep water
8054835 the vehicle is completely on its own from the time it is unplugged on the deck and cut loose in the water we can send a few simple commands but there is no room to micromanage

8054861 bloggers are a market segment that major labels probably havent necessarily interacted with at a promo level as successfully as they do with traditional print media
8054862 labels are looking for solutions to get promos out to these people were trying to build a blog list that is as inclusive as possible
8054863 as labels get used to the system most people are still getting sent everything
8054864 as time goes on things will get targeted a lot more
8054865 pushing a head the size of a watermelon out of the hole the size of an orange
8054866 so we met him with a scooter at his car and he spent a good amount of time here
8054867 he really got a chance to see the building he was very happy with it
8054868 he was the best dean of students he was unbelievable he was a student advocate all the way and a very unselfish man he was a really a nice man who cared about students
8054869 he always went out of his way to talk to students and faculty we learned a lot from him i feel privileged to have a chance to work with him and know him
8054870 when you were with him he never pushed you out the door
8054871 he was an amazing man he would calm people down when they were upset he had more understanding and compassion than i have ever seen
8054872 i dont know one person who didnt like him never did i hear anyone say anything bad about him
8054873 he was the best role model i had in student affairs he was probably the greatest dean we ever had here
8054874 people let their pets loose without being spayed or neutered
8054875 when the dogs reproduce the result is these wild dogs
8054876 we first became aware of the situation in early january
8054877 there were some sporadic complaints around the north campus area regarding a litter of these feral dogs
8054878 it is nowhere near the problem it was 20 to 30 years ago
8054879 there were more landfills back at that time allowing for more places for feral dogs to roam its become somewhat of a rarity
8054880 weve tried to educate the public that you cannot free your pets especially since the rabies outbreak in 1991 its just become a dangerous thing to do
8054881 road kills are taken to landfills and therefore become an attractive place for these dogs
8054882 but the dogs are not attracted to it because they find their own food
8054883 there is nothing in state law that tells us what we have to do in situations
8054884 public safety is always considered if a dog is in the process of attacking someone it can legally be killed without any public outcry if the dogs are stalking livestock they can also be legally killed for example we had an incident in another town where dogs were attacking horses and we eventually had to shoot the dogs in the incident at southern police choppers with thermal imaging were used because those dogs were becoming a public issue
8054885 we think it mightve died because the tranquilizer slows down the heart rate
8054886 the cold weather may have ended up killing the dog that dog has not been spotted in the area since we hit it with the tranquilizer
8054887 it is somewhat unusual for a group of dogs to remain successful
8054888 the group of dogs in that area had a very good food source
8054889 youre going to have roaming dogs in any places but were encouraged at the fact that its become more of a rarity

8054893 tindakan itu mestilah disusuli dengan mengkaji semula ataupun membebaskan semua yang terlibat dalam perhimpunan aman bersih dan batu burok juga
8054894 mengapa tiba tiba presiden umno bersimpati dengan 31 ini mengapa tidak bersimpati dengan anggota polis yang tercedera dan orang awam yang terperangkap dengan angkara keganasan ini dan sejak bila pula atas arahan pm seseorang itu boleh dikecualikan dari undang undang sedangkan raja raja melayu pun boleh diseret ke mahkamah

8054896 this one has more meaning to me because my friend died of cancer in october
8054897 a lot of people were excited to see a survivor that they knew
8054898 this was our most successful event when it comes to the number of people who came and stayed the whole time
8054899 i would like to see it last longer than three years
8054900 with kim leaving i hope this tradition and the fight continues
8054901 you are expecting us the hotel called ahead we will set up the room
8054902 i had been experiencing migraines but i was just ignoring them because i was busy and stuff
8054903 it was probably the lowest point of my life i said to myself im just not coming back period
8054904 but then i realized i needed to figure out a way to fight this
8054905 i get very tired now and have to stop whatever im doing i cant over push myself
8054906 i used to do long hours on the graveyard shift when i first became an ra but i cant do that anymore
8054907 here i am supposed to be here for all these residents who are looking for help and here i am needing help
8054908 we helped each other so much she has helped me to adjust to this weve shared information from our doctors and just stuff we been wonderful having her she was always on call you know how ras are always supposed to be on call well she became always on call for me
8054909 i would think this is crazy she is my resident and im going to her for help
8054910 everyone has been extremely supportive and has been there for me were so close knit of a family we live together this is our building and everyone pulled together
8054911 she can help me in ways no one else can
8054912 she can relate to stuff ive been been there shes in my shoes that i was in two years ago its moral support for the both of us
8054913 i have always loved this quote its from the bible walk by faith and not by sight
8054914 its literally so true and i never realized it you wake up you open your eyes and you can see i didnt realize the small necessities you take for granted because one day i didnt have that
8054915 why would jekyll become hyde without the potion like so many people jekyll knows he is a sinner so he tries desperately to cover his sin with great piles of good works yet his efforts do not actually shrivel his pride and self centeredness they only aggravate it they lead him to superiority self righteousness pride and suddenly look jekyll becomes hyde not in spite of his goodness but because of his goodness
8054916 sin and evil are self centeredness and pride that lead to oppression against others but there are two forms of this one form is being very bad and breaking all the rules and the other form is becoming very good and keeping all the rules and becoming self righteous self salvation through good works may produce a great deal of moral behavior in your life but inside you are filled with self righteousness cruelty and bigotry and you are miserable you are always comparing yourself to other people and you are never sure you are being good enough you cannot therefore deal with your hideousness and self absorption through the moral law by trying to be a good person through an act of the will you need a complete transformation of the very motives of the heart

8054918 ive seen student center custodians mixing recyclables with trash two or three times
8054919 ive only noticed it in the student center but not in the academic halls
8054920 if theyre not going to recycle then the student center shouldnt put out the recycling bins
8054921 i have instructed and reminded the owners of limpiex and its workers of our contract
8054922 i would definitely be on top of it as long as i know its going on thats why the building is so clean
8054923 they know they have to every day all the time keep emptying the recycling containers
8054924 its difficult for us to separate everything when students mix bottles and cans with paper
8054925 not to cause problems but its an issue that has been going on
8054926 is that because theyre saying one thing and doing another
8054927 or are there not enough places to recycle on campus
8054928 during student appreciation day students were given free drinks but had nowhere to recycle them
8054929 when i went for help they told me everything would be fine
8054930 one of my friends was telling me about the complicated financial aid process they have at her school
8054931 she said it took a couple minutes and everything was done i told her she had no idea what it is like to deal with it for months
8054932 i may have filled the forms out wrong but there always seems to be a problem
8054933 if we dont fill out the financial aid form the right way then we need to be told that the financial aid office should tell you how to fix it
8054934 we get two or three parents in distress a day its part of the nature of applying for financial aid through a very complicated federal process we try to simplify it
8054935 we have one of the smallest financial aid staffs for a school of this size 12 000 or 13 000 students that i know of across the country
8054936 we have 10 full time people and its entirely too small
8054937 i got surgery during the semester walked to class on crutches and it took a huge toll on my schoolwork my grade point average dropped tremendously and as a result i lost my financial aid
8054938 because without it i wouldnt have been able to continue college

8054992 the state as the sovereign has an obligation to investigate into all crimes irrespective as to whether these are done by organised criminal gangs terrorists or state agencies themselves this obligation implies that there needs to be a competent and impartial criminal investigation branch within the policing system which has not been corrupted or impaired by political interference there is consensus within sri lanka that the capacity of the police investigation system has been gravely diminished due to political interference over several years and that its internal capacity for investigations has become extremely limited when it comes to organised crimes acts of terrorists and also extrajudicial acts of the military and the police the police investigation system has not demonstrated any capacity for effective investigations in recent years

8055005 scientists have created a robot controlled by a biological brain made of rat neurons the robot named gordon is not exactly an einstein but represents a remarkable bridging of the gap between biology and technology gordon relies a dish with about 60 electrodes to pick up electrical signals generated by the brain cells every time the robot nears an object signals are directed to stimulate the brain by means of the electrodes the researchers explained in a statement released today by the university of reading in england in response the brains output drives the robots wheels left and right so that it moves around in an attempt to avoid hitting objects the robot has no additional control from a human or a computer the scientists state its sole means of control is from its own brain

8055085 overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent
8055086 an order that they be sent to private or public school rather than educated at home by their mother
8055087 primarily based on its view that parents have an absolute constitutional right to homeschool their children
8055088 we filed our original opinion on feb 28 2008 granting the petition on the bases that 1 california statutory law does not permit homeschooling and 2 this prohibition does not violate the u s constitution
8055089 in order to provide an opportunity for further argument on the multiple complex issues involved in this case including but not limited to 1 additional california statutes that might bear upon the issue and 2 potentially applicable provisions of the california constitution
8055090 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling
8055091 in 1929 however homeschool was amended out of the law and children who were not educated in public or private schools could be taught privately aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approva l of homeschooling by exempting homeschools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools
8055092 it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that homeschools are permissible in california when conducted as a private school
8055093 a parent or guardian working exclusively with his or her children
8055094 we therefore conclude that home schools may constitute private schools
8055095 to issue any reasonable orders for the care of a dependent child including orders limiting the right of the parents to make educational decisions for the child
8055096 because the united states supreme court has held that parents possess a constitutional right to direct the education of their children it is argued that any restriction on homeschooling is a violation of this constitutional right we disagree we conclude that an order requiring a dependent child to attend school outside the home in order to protect that childs safety is not an unconstitutional violation of the parents right to direct the education of their children
8055097 parents possess a constitutional liberty interest in directing the education of their children but the right must yield to state interests in certain circumstances
8055098 in this case the restriction on homeschooling would arise in a proceeding in which the children
8055099 should a dependency court conclude in the proper exercise of its discretion that due to the history of abuse and neglect in the family requiring a dependent child to have regular contact with mandated reporters is necessary to guarantee the childs safety that order would satisfy strict scrutiny there can be no dispute that the childs safety is a compelling governmental interest restricting homeschooling also appears to be narrowly tailored to achieving that goal without contact with mandated reporters it may well be that the childs safety cannot be guaranteed without removing the child from the parents custody as such the restriction on homeschooling would be the least restrictive means of achieving the goal of protecting the children they would be permitted to continue to live at home with their parents but their educators would change in order to provide them an extra layer of protection
8055100 that mother has a teaching credential such that the children can be said to be receiving an education from a credentialed tutor
8055101 not the quality of evidence that permits us to say that application of californias compulsory public school education law to them violates their first amendment rights
8055102 such sparse representations are too easily asserted by any parent who wishes to homeschool his or her child
8055103 they teach things that are totally contrary to what we believe they put questions in our childrens minds we dont feel theyre ready for
8055104 when they are much more mature they can deal with these issues alternative lifestyles and such or whether they came from primordial slop at the present time its my job to teach them the correct way of thinking

8055108 if they werent muslim theyd look like one of the biggest catholic churches youd ever seen from an organizational standpoint
8055109 i think theyre even working on their first eagle scout
8055110 a certain kind of sophisticated thinking is now beginning to emerge because people who were born in the u s are taking over
8055111 there are lawyers in the muslim community they werent there before the management is learning how to work things out
8055112 of the potential 35 prayers you have in a week for 34 there will be only about 30 people but for that one friday prayer there will be like a thousand people showing up
8055113 where do they park they park on the road they park here they park there the prayer starts exactly on time every day so it becomes a huge bottleneck of space and time
8055114 if somebody wants to operate a program within our mission and vision they can do it
8055115 a free market of ideas and activities thats not centrally controlled
8055116 theyre not saying were going to send people and create a new mosque or plant an independent church
8055117 certainly it puts the expansion of their congregation ahead of the expansion of the kingdom
8055118 because of how streamlined we are you can get off the highway from anywhere and find a mosque that is well maintained well structured and that will always be open
8055119 we offer events that arent just one persons vision what we give is something that is formally approved by a committee
8055120 if i go into any of the iscf islamic society of central florida mosques i know that just like the marketing material the newsletters and the community announcements are the same the imam is also following the same policy as all the imams in the other mosques to have good relations with people of other faiths so we can understand that we are a part of this country
8055121 our rituals and congregational chanting are all pretty much the same
8055122 if im in the downtown area i can just shoot over to any mosque for friday prayers
8055123 are we going to go national with this thats yet to be decided
8055124 but i hope were a model that any person of faith would want to be a part of if just to inspire them to create something similar
8055125 while i understand frostees decision to cut me based on my performance in the past season and i realize that it is confusing that her mother thought i was more attractive than jason pominville i will not stand being accused of jinxing this team i love the sabres and would never jinx them frostee was just saying that to keep people from learning her secret she touched the stanley cup its her fault that the sabres didnt make the playoffs and i wont let her get away with blaming this all on me
8055126 frostee did not touch the stanley cup on purpose i have spoken to her and she said that while at the hockey hall of fame her shoulder accidentally brushed up against lord stanley while her family was taking a picture with him im not holding her accountable for the suckiness of the buffalo sabres
8055127 frostee may be one of the most dedicated fans we have but its not her fault that we didnt make the playoffs our team didnt play well this season and thats why we didnt make the postseason if you want to blame someone for touching the stanley cup and jinxing us blame me i accidentally touched it last summer when drew had it i dont know about anyone else but i know that this wont affect my decision to remain in the competition to be frostees sabres boyfriend
8055128 we are afraid to move out some christians staying in institutions or bungalows are hiding in jungles or villages we have two to three policemen and they cant control a big crowd we have asked for more security
8055129 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our campus and our people that is a true blessing
8055130 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
8055131 having ministered in orissa i can only imagine the plight of these tribal believers forced to run for their lives into the jungle
8055132 my heart goes out to the missionaries and believers we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time
8055133 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers

8055263 il tonfo delle borse questa volta non e frutto di operazioni speculative ma riflette la paura per la recessione americana in questo contesto nessuno puo negare che le istanze di giustizia sociale e la necessita di dare fiato alleconomia conducano alla stessa ricetta tagliare le tasse sui redditi medio bassi dei lavoratori e dei pensionati aumentando cosi la domanda interna e garantendo accanto a un miglioramento della qualita della vita per milioni di persone un sostegno alleconomia
8055264 e necessario aumentare la tassazione delle rendite finanziarie che nel fornire risorse preziose per lo stato non ridurrebbe la domanda perche il 90 dei titoli pubblici non e detenuto dalle famiglie ma da grandi potentati economici di fronte alla sofferenza sociale di milioni di persone e al rischio della recessione aggiunge e ora di smetterla con le ideologie liberiste i soldi ci sono vanno usati prima che sia troppo tardi

8055317 being inducted into the hall of fame is a once in a lifetime kind of thing
8055318 and being named coach of the year makes me feel that im being rewarded for all the things ive done in my career
8055319 it means a lot to me to have these things named after me because the community of limon has been very special to me
8055320 they have given me so much support over the years that ive just tried to give back whatever i could
8055321 those football teams were incredible but i am most proud of some of the track teams we have had
8055322 in 2005 we scored over 100 points as a team in the state track meet and that was one of my proudest moments as a coach
8055323 i dont think i have anything left to prove or do except maybe hit the lottery and improve my golf game
8055324 you have to love the sports because you dont get rich coaching high school sports
8055325 but you cant be a great coach without great athletes and i have been lucky enough to coach fine students and competitors at limon
8055326 youre successful when you have good kids and mitch has always got the best out of the kids he has coached
8055327 whenever we would whine because we didnt want to run during practice he would just yell at us and tell us to put in our work
8055328 when i came in as a freshman it was intimidating because he was such a great coach but he made me feel comfortable and confident in my abilities
8055329 first of all get all of the knowledge you possibly can by going to coaching clinics and talking to other coaches
8055330 but if you treat the kids the right way which means being a friend but also making sure they know whos the boss they will listen and respond positively
8055331 pretty much the parents came up with everything to come out here
8055332 its great for the kids to come out and compete against other teams and but it is definitely a financial decision too
8055333 i think one of the biggest things ive seen is the improvement in the play of the kids that are just 9 or 10 years old
8055334 its obvious that soccer skills are being taught at younger and younger ages and some of the under 11 games look like miniatures of a college game or something of that level
8055335 many of these parents have played the game themselves which is something thats new
8055336 there are more parents and coaches who understand the game and thats really brought things to a new level
8055337 with college costs also on the rise i think there are a fair number of parents out there who are hoping to offset some of these costs if their children win scholarships
8055338 i dont think its their only motivation but i think its definitely on a lot of their minds
8055339 we hope to create an identity around athletics that will contribute to the spirit of the school and a more well balanced student body
8055340 teaching students to push themselves to their highest level physically is a way of increasing their discipline which can be translated into academics and the arts
8055341 we are all about teaching students to overcome perceived limitations by challenging them to do new things and supporting them along the way
8055342 we wouldnt be able to attract students or sustain the high school without offering activities
8055343 at this stage theyre just thrilled to have the opportunity to play on a competitive a or 2a level
8055344 they have opportunities that may not have been open to them in other scenarios
8055345 were developing leaders here being a four year senior is a once in a lifetime opportunity

8055359 strange the same question was never asked about tim mcviegh
8055360 strange that the left didnt protest the governments involvement at waco
8055361 the founding fathers wanted all the governing at the state and local level

8055368 session coverage in most situations your primary job is to provide coverage of the sessions make sure you have a blogger scheduled to cover each session if you have extra bloggers assign them other tasks such as hallway interviews or let them take a break plan what type of coverage you want to provide with the organizers do they want detailed notes or just a general overview if youve planned ahead you should already have a draft post with speaker panelist titles and links ready to go if you havent planned ahead focus on taking notes then fill in the details later remember you can always come back to a post and edit it if you have problems posting or any other issue hand off to the tech guru and move on to the next session look for tidbits from the session that can be converted to additional posts or polls at the fpra conference one of the more popular items was the dino dog or dinosaur post this came out of a q amp a with a speaker what additional information can you get from the speaker is the speaker willing to provide copy of the handouts or some other elements of their presentation upload them and link them did the speaker show a video can you link to it on youtube or get a copy of it from the speaker other coverage as we all know the true fun at conferences is the interaction that goes on outside the session rooms this can include hallway conversations dinners receptions time by the pool you name it do your best to cover these items many times these are the posts that draw the most interest and often have a lasting impression if you attended the sessions sure you can check out those posts but what attendees really enjoy doing is looking back over photos and other fun times planning ahead and make this portion of the blogging fun if the blog team is attending a cocktail party give each of them an assignment use the social time to do attendee member profile interviews but most importantly take plenty of photos

8055431 in february of 1861 miss havergal went to her brother in law henry crane at his and his wifes earnest wish to teach their little girls the arrangement met with her fathers approval for he knew that she would not then be able to study so strenuously she fitted into the family at oakhampton splendidly throwing herself heart and soul into her little neices studies and games in her poem the childrens triumph we can see her attitude of mind towards them the sunbeams and the robins had begged her to come out but all in vain but the children came to my window and said come out and play come out with us in the sunshine tis such a glorious day then never another word i wrote and my desk was put away when the children called me what could i do the robins might fail and the sunbeams too but the chldren won the day she exercised a beautiful influence over these two nieces teaching them not only for this world but for eternity the eldest evelyn died in april 1868 in a letter written as early as 1855 f r h speaks of her as a child my evelyn is ill but she is very gentle and patient indeed i never saw a sick child so utterly without fretfulness she is lovely a perfect sunbeam with golden wavy hair thirteen years after when the letter conveying news of the death of evelyn arrived she could not grasp it at first she writes to her sister marie the memorial card made me realise it at last last night i sat long with it before me with such an utter flood of love for that child in my heart it rose and rose and the sense of sorrow and loss with it and how i last saw her in all her graceful beauty then at last came a sudden glimpse almost a vision of seeing her again and having such a full loving welcome from her above doubly glad must this loving aunt have felt that it had been her privilege to lead this young neice to the saviour just three years before

8055444 oh s he has done so much for the struggle and taking them down will take down the whole org
8055445 i appreciate that he is drawing a picture that is inclusive of experiences besides his own which is important but for me more care is needed and or he should work with defer to someone else to make certain statements and claims
8055446 thank god a white guy is saying this stuff because no one will listen to us when we say it
8055447 a redistributionist liberalism but he is skeptical of too much government tinkering his most influential advisors hail from the university of chicago a bastion of free marketers

8055451 i think that when you think about 10 for a 100 000 home its very modest increase and given the history of not having increase for the last two years i think its an extraordinary statement to proposed something to modest
8055452 thats how every time our hostage negotiation team goes out or even out swat team thats we prefer for it to end sometime we waited a very long time and were willing to do that it helps keep everyone safe including the person weve established contact with none of our officers were injured theyre safe none of the surrounding residents were injured so thats the most important thing
8055453 we just dont have an answer but were going to try and find one
8055454 we wore black today all day to remember his loss and to remember him
8055455 he was a great dude a great dude and good at football and he was a funny cat
8055456 its a hard thing to embrace and wrap your arms around because we all want an answers but we are going to continue to look at what was done and see if theres any possibility anything could have been done differently
8055457 any information about this animal has to be given by animal control
8055458 i ask this court to make sure that this man does not drink for the five to seven years that he is on probation
8055459 we absolutely are not saying its ok to drink and drive hes been convicted of a felony hes been convicted of second degree manslaughter hes lost the woman that was essentially his wife he will be on supervised probation any kind of mistake will send him to prison for seven years
8055460 enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of davis own speech
8055461 requires a candidate to choose between the first amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations
8055462 the millionaires amendment represents a modest sensible and plainly constitutional attempt by congress to minimize the advantages enjoyed by wealthy candidates
8055463 the 2ndamendment protects an individualright to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionall lawful purposes such as self defense within the home
8055464 sacred just as the right to free speech and assembly
8055465 er zijn geen kleine stapjes meer te maken op de nederlandse woningmarkt het gaat meteen over twee ton in euros of meer zon sprong is voor veel mensen financieel absoluut onhaalbaar

8055467 when we championed trash culture we had no idea it would become the only culture
8055468 so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do
8055469 how vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live
8055470 this loss is going to be hard to take but we cant cry over spilled milk and we just have to look toward working harder next week
8055471 but we didnt look like the same team in the second half and we showed some pride and never felt like the game was over
8055472 they stole the momentum from us by getting those three turnovers in a row
8055473 then they started pounding the ball at us and we made too many mistakes to win this game
8055474 we had some chances to win this game but we just couldnt get it done
8055475 we had to come out strong we knew it would be tough im glad we pulled it off
8055476 it feels so good quarterback tanner keiley had a good fake the linebacker stopped and didnt know whether to take me or tanner
8055477 we only had the one breakdown there at the end
8055478 we want our players to develop a good volleyball iq
8055479 knowing and being able to read the other team makes it easier to defend them were always defensively sound but beyond that you have to be able to get into your offense and have it be effective
8055480 you never know if youre rebuilding or reloading until you put your team on the court
8055481 were aiming high hopefully it all comes together we could be in line for a good season
8055482 we have a lot of seniors and two newcomers who will impact the team greatly we have a ton of experience at the setting position and our strong hitters will all bring in big numbers
8055483 this is just another of many examples of how the terrorists indiscriminately target innocent civilians including women and children
8055484 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8055487 possibile che in tutti questi anni non abbia ancora capito una mazza ma che ci sto a fare io qui

8055489 well you know how sensitive he is when he drinks you should have just let him talk
8055490 typically the forests that have been destroyed by catastrophic fire were strongly multi cohort with older cohort trees of 150 to 600 years of age also typically the vegetation that arises after the fires is sclerophyllous brush with a few even aged conifer germinants
8055491 the masterly interpretation that inspired in us profound emotions and spiritual suggestions
8055492 it is an inner journey that the famous austrian composer wrote in 1827 only a year before his premature death at the age of 31
8055493 when schubert introduces a poetic text in his sonorous universe he interprets it through a melodic union that penetrates the soul with gentleness also leading the listener to feel the very nostalgic consumption of the musician the very appeal of that truth of the heart that goes beyond any rationality hence a picture is born that speaks of genuine ordinariness of nostalgia of introspection and of future
8055494 young schubert spontaneous and exuberant succeeded in communicating also to us tonight what he saw and experienced
8055495 therefore the recognition is merited that this illustrious giant of music receives universally who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria interiorly comforted by tonights splendid musical experience we renew our gratitude
8055496 we the catholic community of orissa profoundly condemn the terrible event and express our profound sympathy to the deceaseds loved ones
8055497 against the dignity and liberty of persons and compromises peaceful civil coexistence
8055498 so that with a sense of responsibility an end is put to all violence and a climate of dialogue and mutual respect is re established
8055499 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8055500 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8055501 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8055502 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8055503 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8055504 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8055505 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8055506 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8055507 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8055508 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8055509 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8055510 an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons
8055511 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason
8055512 should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8055513 the various stages of exhumation inspection and reburial will be spread over several days and we anticipate that this will take place in the autumn of this year once all is ready here in the church
8055514 part of the established procedure prior to a beatification requires that if the body of the new beatus exists then it must be exhumed inspected and transferred to a place of honor befitting the persons new status
8055515 as a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself cardinal newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the holy see and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable hence it is that his body will not be returned to the grave at rednal but brought here into the oratory church and placed in a specially constructed sarcophagus
8055516 it should be noted that at the specific request of the congregation for saints causes the exhumation will be an entirely private event but that the re interment in our church will be a public ceremony
8055517 if the theologians vote in favor the cardinals of the congregation for saints causes will meet to give their approval
8055518 then the matter will be put before pope benedict xvi who alone can issue the decree of beatification which will probably occur sometime in december
8055519 it is likely that the actual beatification ceremony would be held in rome during the spring or early summer of 2009
8055520 the images of hundreds of thousands of people from around the world gathering in randwick racecourse to pray with pope benedict will become an enduring reminder of one of the most special events in sydneys history
8055521 both sites provided spectacular settings for solemn yet joyous liturgical events watched by up to a billion people globally
8055522 every sydneysider no matter what their faith should be proud of the way in which the city hosted the youth of the world in july
8055523 the church was coming out of the catacombs and there was fear of being too exposed nevertheless we began the greek catholics agreed with us and something really useful was undertaken
8055524 canon 901 of the code of canon law states that a priest is entitled to offer mass for anyone living or dead from this premise he concludes that means to me it does not forbid intention for priestly vocations
8055525 the most venerable sacrament is the blessed eucharist in which christ the lord himself is contained offered and received and by which the church continually lives and grows the eucharistic sacrifice the memorial of the death and resurrection of the lord in which the sacrifice of the cross is forever perpetuated is the summit and the source of all worship and christian life by means of it the unity of gods people is signified and brought about and the building up of the body of christ is perfected the other sacraments and all the apostolic works of christ are bound up with and directed to the blessed eucharist
8055526 the church cannot live and grow without priests thus it does not seem that a mass intention for priestly vocations is forbidden but rather encouraged
8055527 it is the practice in our parish for the celebrant to give communion under both kinds at the side of the altar to the server who may also double as assistant in distributing communion to the congregation or if there are a number of communion assistants to them all also at the altar is this correct it is also the practice to give communion from the chalice only to individuals from the congregation who presumably have requested this because of a problem with gluten
8055528 the priest may be assisted in the distribution of communion by other priests who happen to be present
8055529 these ministers should not approach the altar before the priest has received communion and they are always to receive from the hands of the priest celebrant the vessel containing either species of the most holy eucharist for distribution to the faithful
8055530 they are human beings with an inalienable right to live
8055531 is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8055532 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8055533 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8055534 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8055535 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8055536 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8055537 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8055538 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8055539 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8055540 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8055541 if someone is rude enough to look in the shower i hope they find a pubic hair on the soap
8055542 i never really thought wed have time for that anyway
8055543 for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief
8055544 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth

8055547 she saves me having to the cobwebs as she eats little spiders and bugs
8055548 i cant wait until she has babies then we can build up our natural pest control measures
8055549 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8055550 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8055551 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8055552 by working independently i can offer the luxury of unhurried appointments in the comfort of a clients own home allowing plenty of time to prepare for the birth
8055553 the length of labour need for pain relief maternal satisfaction and length of breastfeeding have been shown to be improved by having a known and trusted midwife which i believe is something every woman deserves
8055554 i enjoy supporting women and families at this significant time in their lives and have the back up of other independent midwives if need be my aim is for women to be fully informed and active participants and to empower them and their partners to obtain the most from this precious experience enabling them to move forwards into parenthood in a positive way
8055555 you know monsieur the french are the only people on the earth who do more flag waving than the americans
8055556 you know the last army to march in victory under the arc de triomphe was the american army before that it was the germans when exactly was the last time the french had occasion to celebrate a real triumph
8055557 wonderful very nicely lit im thinking about taking the bridge climb tour this week so i can take in the whole harbour

8055562 slow growth the rest of the year and possibly an economy grinding to a halt
8055563 the dollar is seeing a bit of weakness after going on a tear for the last month
8055564 theres so much uncertainty out there that its hardly surprising to see the flight to quality in the treasury markets and the bounce here in gold
8055565 if the dollar continues to weaken then we may have seen a bottom in gold
8055566 the stock index futures most likely will break the july lows and this will be very supportive to bonds and the precious metals going forward
8055567 money is sneaking back into gold and crude as the dollar weakens
8055568 it seems to me that the markets are cycling back to commodities as inflation becomes a bigger and more realistic worry
8055569 we suspect that with the dollars advance on hold for now and energy prices moving higher metals will also push higher in sympathy over the next few days
8055570 in addition we suspect that there will be a good deal of short covering that could also aid the advance
8055571 however this will be a rally in what seems to us to be a general drift lower as the bearish macro background is still very much with us

8055575 hope you have a good weekend maybe we can get together next week and catch a movie
8055576 i dont think it will end up being that big of a transition for us
8055577 weve been playing smoky hill and grandview and teams like that for years now so i think we at least know what were up against
8055578 were really strong this year just in technical ability and speed
8055579 we have great touch and with players like javier salome and jake martinez were going to have some of the most creative attackers
8055580 its going to be great to have some of those leaders on defense this year
8055581 it will allow us to keep our quick offense going and still shut down other teams
8055582 last year we were kind of a team with a couple of superstars and we dont have those guys this year
8055583 but i think thats making us play better as a unit and were seeing guys develop into roles that we need really nicely
8055584 we have a lot of speed and technical skill this year especially at midfield
8055585 were really going to be looking to them to get our attack going and help us be solid on defense
8055586 this is a game between two great football programs which both have a lot of tradition and respect for one another
8055587 ralston likes to run the football and we like to option and throw it so it should be an interesting clash of styles
8055588 when two very good teams play its all about fundamentals and not making mistakes
8055589 both teams have had a week less to prepare but going up there will be a great measuring stick for our program
8055590 the kids in these programs have played against each other since they were in middle school
8055591 we have a great amount of respect for coach mark buderus and his program
8055592 they were just better than us last season and they put it on us pretty good
8055593 weve never done this week zero thing before so it will be interesting to see what happens
8055594 we think that this will be a good game for our program and we will see where we stand

8055598 weve had a good run here the past few years
8055599 were fortunate to have a good feeder program and kids who come from a socioeconomic position that allows them to concentrate on developing their games
8055600 we did lose all three of our singles players and i cant remember the last time that happened
8055601 the key for us is to have new singles players step up and to develop chemistry with our doubles teams early in the season we have our work cut out for us to knock kent off but we look forward to that challenge
8055602 stephen is our best player ever he didnt lose a match last year until the state tournament
8055603 were stronger overall as a team our kids are really eager and more than happy to get ready
8055604 but it is one step toward becoming the leaders of this school
8055605 we want to start out with a great reputation for doing things the right way
8055606 were not so worried about wins but laying the foundation to win when we step up
8055607 you want to start it off right you do it right and youre done

8055609 there is always a desire to have your own facilities
8055610 but we cant feel were shortchanged because lewis palmer can make use of it
8055611 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8055612 what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8055613 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8055614 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8055615 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

8055632 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8055633 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side trackback
8055634 the point is not to observe the world but to change it
8055635 you can accept the world as it is or look as it should be
8055636 control of the island to its people when the spanish were kicked out they passed the platt amendment which gave the us basing rights and it also stipulated that cuba had only a limited right to conduct its own foreign policy and debt policy
8055637 self government why these people are no more fit for self government than gunpowder is for hell
8055638 military occupation of our country by our allies who treat us as a people incapable acting for ourselves and who have reduced us to obedience and submission this can not be our fate after years of struggle
8055639 its funny though that bush is following barack obamas plan
8055640 whats wrong with these people and how did they get so radical
8055641 so whats your complaint that bush won the war and is leaving now
8055642 since you libs like being defeated so much its going to be a happy day for you in november when your marxism is rejected again
8055643 youre not fooling anyone and its driving the libs insane as they live in denial

8055648 the government will be in the forefront to do so and they will give out their part the corporate world will also be interested and i hope it will be good
8055649 also it should be obvious that there is more interracial crime of blacks against whites because there are again more whites in this country than any other group
8055650 1939 under a high mound a 27 metre long ship had been buried with a huge hoard of treasure and weapons this was the burial of a great warrior lord in the mounds around him other powerful people had been buried we think this was the cemetery of the pagan anglo saxon kings of east anglia used between about 590 630 ad the ship had been hauled from the river and pulled up the slope to her final resting place there the great man was laid among precious objects from every corner of the known world in a celebration of his power
8055651 we wanted to let everyone know that lewis palmer is going to contend for state this year and we wanted to take cheyenne mountain down a notch
8055652 they know the league is important to us and they wanted to open league play on their home course im not surprised they did well we have four who average within two three strokes
8055653 i used the time in between lightning delays to work on my putting
8055654 i saw a lot of positive things today but i just wish we could have changed the way it ended
8055655 it was heartbreaking we made some mistakes there at the end in the infield but i think they are definitely correctable as we move on this season
8055656 we didnt hit very well as a team but we were able to make the most of some of the opportunities that we had
8055657 it was a close game which is a great way for us both to start the season both teams are going to get better but this is a good starting point
8055658 we knew if we could get mekella out there even not in top form that we would be competitive
8055659 now weve just got to work on building a rotation behind her that will give her a break sometimes
8055660 i expected a 66 i missed some short putts but made some long ones i hit the greens but you can hit those from anywhere on patty jewett

8055663 by tradition the stamps during a vacant see should be printed as soon as possible the rest has to do with an event that takes place solely in the vatican
8055664 during a vacant see period the power to authorize the issuing of new stamps or coins falls as with any other activity of the state into the hands of the cardinal camerlengo the head of the papal household for a brief period during which it is nevertheless necessary to reaffirm the continuity of the life of the state without interruption through the issuance of new stamps and printing of new coins
8055665 the announcement of the passing of john paul ii filled me and my collaborators not only with sorrow but also with a certain anxiety because we would need to make these stamps three in total very quickly but 26 years had passed since the last vacant see i vaguely remembered it my collaborators were just kids and many had never lived through one at all so there was a generational gap we had to overcome we had clear difficulties in beginning to design these stamps
8055666 finally some frescos from the apostolic room which one of our collaborators just happened to see one day came to our rescue
8055667 should be immediately pulled out of circulation they are no longer valid they can later be collected but they can no longer be used as postage
8055668 the intense atmosphere of sad loneliness caused by his schuberts delicate state of health and his sentimental and professional disappointments
8055669 it is an interior journey that the celebrated austrian composer wrote in 1827 just one year before his premature death at the age of 31
8055670 when schubert brings a poetic text into his universe of sound he performs it through a melodic link that penetrates the soul with sweetness bringing the listener to feel his same nostalgic consummation the same call of that truth of the heart that goes beyond all rationality in this way a picture is born that speaks of genuine everyday life of nostalgia of introspection and of the future
8055671 the spontaneous and exuberant young schubert was successful in communicating to us here tonight as well what he lived and experienced he is worthy therefore of the universal acclaim that is given to this illustrious genius of music who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria
8055672 fail to acknowledge the profound complexity most people feel on the issue of abortion she asserted that such putatively complex opinions can be respected
8055673 an effective and passionate leader who will protect a womans right to choose now and for future generations
8055674 every single advance for gay rights has come at the state level
8055675 go back and support those pro gay state legislators and eliminate the anti gay state legislators

8055677 the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
8055678 and he looked at me and said i think thats quaint
8055679 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
8055680 it will ultimately hurt obama to have a catholic pro abortion running mate because the issue will come up again
8055681 sen biden has a strong record of opposing judicial nominees with hostile anti choice records he voted against george w bushs two anti choice nominees to the u s supreme court john roberts and samuel alito and he opposed anti choice justice clarence thomas nomination to the court as well as multiple anti choice nominees to lower federal courts
8055682 as a catholic thats a decision that biden and god are going to have to work out at the pearly gates
8055683 biden starts from the belief that a woman has a right to choose and thats what matters
8055684 viva la familia reminds us all that the most important social institution is the family
8055685 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
8055686 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8055687 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8055688 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8055689 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8055690 she must know very well one of the premier works on the subject jesuit john connerys abortion the development of the roman catholic perspective loyola 1977
8055691 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8055692 the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
8055693 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8055694 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8055695 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
8055696 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8055697 the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8055698 barack obama is a pro abortion radical so theres nothing surprising about his choosing a pro abortion running mate
8055699 neither senator obama nor senator biden seems to have taken catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously
8055700 the churchs pro life position is not sectarian it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument
8055701 neither obama nor biden seems willing to do that which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness
8055702 catholics for obama tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro abortion ticket in american history
8055703 an affable veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of sen john kerry by overselling his catholic credentials
8055704 a wake up call to the church clergy and laity alike
8055705 improve the way we hand on the faith be willing to exercise the spiritual work of mercy of admonishing the sinner and to keep politically active so that such people are voted out of office
8055706 if a politician cannot respect the life of a little baby how is he supposed to respect yours and mine
8055707 the democrats are slapping faithful catholics right in the face first they will nominate the most pro abortion candidate in history then they refuse to invite the beloved archbishop of denver even to offer a prayer at their convention and now they nominate a pro abortion catholic as vice president only self hating catholics could vote for this ticket
8055708 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
8055709 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington del has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
8055710 the fulfillment of a desire expressed by betancourt herself in bogota after she was freed on july 2
8055711 the holy father met with betancourts mother yolanda pulecio at the vatican and that the pontiffs repeated pleas for the release of all hostages and their return to their families as well as for a new dialogue of reconciliation in colombia are widely known
8055712 we wish to express to you our most sincere support for the work you are carrying out in defense and in benefit of life and the family in ecuador
8055713 we would like to take this opportunity to not only support your work but also your statement which encompasses the thinking of the church and the christian people of ecuador
8055714 we must put a stop to the violence or it will destroy us all
8055715 our reflection is focused in a particular way on the confrontation that is occurring between students and parents here we see that the culture of violence in which we are submerged has penetrated into the heart of the new generations and could even wound the family itself the fundamental cell of our society
8055716 these actions that hurt the dignity and freedom of the people and compromise a peaceful civic coexistence
8055717 everyone to put an end with a sense of responsibility to any over reaction and help rebuild a climate of dialogue and mutual respect

8055857 i totally was nervous about being around older players the speed they play at and how hard they hit the ball i really didnt want to look bad

8055868 they must have been satisfied with the people they found in the building
8055869 the sierra principal decided to start from a clean slate as they do each year
8055870 the principals have autonomy to follow those procedures but they have their own professional way of going about it
8055871 i can tell you the athletics people in the city are laughing about it
8055872 1 applicant must be a current employee of harrison school district two at sierra high school substitutes are not considered employees of the district
8055873 if someone in the building did apply and was already a known person to the students they would be considered perhaps more highly than an unknown applicant
8055874 it is common practice but you dont usually have enough applicants who are qualified or interested from inside the building
8055875 no matter what i do to help they will always be the same
8055876 quick to complain slow to pay or want more than is agreed

8055881 en mejor as quer amos hacer un video que llevara un mensaje claro quisimos aprovechar que nuestros j venes entran a clase para decirles que no se averg encen del evangelio pues es poder de dios
8055882 fue una muy buena experiencia ya que pudimos trabajar con un grupo de j venes actores cristianos muy capaces y dispuestos
8055883 la idea era cambiar un poco los personajes que fueran caras m s latinas para que nuestros j venes se identificaran con lo que est bamos tratando de decirles
8055884 among those doing this work many are ordinary local people and civic groups in places where survivors have been relocated who have gathered together their money and goods to help as best as they can people from religious groups of all persuasions are also actively involved others are famous actors who have some financial security and a concern for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens and some are members of human rights networks who have at this time put aside their ordinary activities to concentrate on the cyclone recovery effort the asian human rights commission is in contact with some of these persons and in view of the dramatic delay in assistance from abroad and continued restrictions on what is getting in has recognised the urgent need for continued support for these people and groups until the situation changes therefore it is now accepting donations on their behalf money received can be forwarded within the same day unfortunately for the safety of recipients the ahrc is not able to reveal their details publicly however for financial purposes some information can be given to credible institutional donors and those known to the ahrc upon request

8055893 the art of the deal is a commonsense guide to personal finance in practical advice books as in life there are no guarantees and readers are cautioned to rely on their own judgment about their individual circumstances and to act accordingly
8055894 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
8055895 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
8055896 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
8055897 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
8055898 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
8055899 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
8055900 have anyone ever told you youre pretty coz im not telling you
8055901 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
8055902 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8055903 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
8055904 and you see that is why i love this country
8055905 now you know why i asked her out so many times you want a persistent president
8055906 were looking to have a big year because were stacked as a team with more experience
8055907 i think we can win state as a team and i definitely want to win it as an individual
8055908 mike has all the skills necessary to be one of the best
8055909 but this team as a whole has all the talent to be better than the one that won regionals two years ago
8055910 weve got a better team this year because we only had two seniors leave and i think weve got a really good chance to win again at regionals
8055911 we have a deep team but we need max solomon kelly cobb jack stimple to step up if were going to make a run at state
8055912 after living in chicago you start to panic when you see your kid is not where you expect them
8055913 he really believed the lessons learned in football applied to life
8055914 i was a single mom with four boys and he was very fortunate to have great male role models
8055915 they were his football coaches and he wanted to make sure kids had that
8055916 he wanted to beat you during the game but before and after he was the nicest guy
8055917 he just wanted all the kids to improve not just his he coached football the right way
8055918 having a football team was a big step for hanover
8055919 it was important to the guys and the community he created a bond with the community
8055920 i cant believe no one has said this yet so i will

8055927 the iraqi security forces working with coalition forces in baghdad contributed immensely to the rashid districts decrease in the levels of violence
8055928 the iraqi citizens consistently help both the isf and soldiers of the 1st raider brigade in providing a safe and secure environment by furnishing tips on enemy activity and weapons caches
8055929 this violent act only serves as an attempt by the terrorists to affect the ongoing progress in jalula
8055930 the iraqi security forces will not be deterred and will continue to maintain security and stability

8055938 los hombres pol ticos no han escuchado las invitaciones del papa a ser constructores de paz en nombre de un inter s superior ha faltado el di logo interreligioso pero tambi n el di logo con los pueblos que no siempre han estado presentes entre quienes gobiernan
8055939 se cumple de este modo el deseo expresado por la propia betancourt desde bogot tras su liberaci n el pasado 2 de julio
8055940 ya el pasado mes de febrero el santo padre recibi en el vaticano a la madre de ingrid yolanda pulecio y conocidas son las reiteradas peticiones de libertad de todos los secuestrados lanzadas por el pont fice invocando el regreso a casa de los prisioneros y un

8055943 desde su altar del cobre la virgen de la caridad ha estado presente en el coraz n de la mayor a de los cubanos y nos ha acompa ado
8055944 conquist el coraz n de muchas personas pues la sent an cercana y acud an ante ella para manifestarle amor y alcanzar sus favores el cobre se convirti hasta el d a de hoy en

8055948 conversar sin interesarse por el resultado de la verdad es entonces quien miente con m s habilidad en las opiniones sobre temas pol ticos econ micos y culturales lo primero de todo es que la verdad tiene que estar encima de la mesa no la ideolog a
8055949 es necesario ese di logo en que la verdad y el bien com n sean el tema de conversaci n y que los t cnicos den los elementos para conversar
8055950 hoy se habla mucho de democracia inclusi n y de di logo pero hay que quitarse las caretas y que cada uno realmente sostenga si cree en el di logo que lo ejerza si cree en la democracia que la viva si cree en la libre discusi n de las ideas que respete y tambi n exponga las suyas y as seremos el pa s que queremos ser
8055951 es una pena contemplar de pronto c mo el pa s se encrespa y empieza a haber una situaci n un poco sorprendente
8055952 son nuestras familias nuestros amigos nuestra realidad y territorio es la estima por este pa s y el deseo de superaci n
8055953 qu beneficio trae al desarrollo de la zona desde el punto de vista social aqu hablamos de escuelas hospitales desarrollo humano comunicaci n y una serie de aspectos que van a hacer la vida m s humana y al mismo tiempo van a respetar el mbito cultural de las personas
8055954 es perfectamente compatible un buen nivel econ mico una buena situaci n social y al mismo tiempo un cuidado de una calidad de vida
8055955 el rol de la iglesia debe quedarse en iluminar a trav s de los principios que ayuden a los que sienten que tienen la fe cat lica que la experiencia de dos mil a os lleva a la iglesia a conformar la doctrina social que procura el bien com n en una sociedad
8055956 un mundo sin perd n es inhumano y es uno de los problemas que hoy atraviesa la humanidad
8055957 eso se logra si cada d a tienes unos minutos de silencio en el que le dices qu quieres de m se or
8055958 duele cuando un joven se quita la vida es algo que no nos deja indiferentes
8055959 ten an un dolor en el alma porque se insiste en promover una sociedad al margen de dios o como si dios no existiera
8055960 viven carentes de amor carentes de sentido carentes de trascendencia algunos de nuestros j venes no quieren vivir porque
8055961 el mundo y la sociedad se presentan para muchos j venes como algo hostil
8055962 dado que el suicidio es absolutamente contradictorio con el principio m s propio de los seres humanos de cuidar la vida nos interpela y nos impulsa a buscar las causas y las posibles soluciones
8055963 esto continu lleva a que haya personas de primera categor a los ganadores y de segunda los perdedores quienes por supuesto bajo esta ptica sobran
8055964 si queremos j venes m s sanos si queremos menos consumo de droga y de alcohol si queremos menos suicidios no queda otra opci n que fortalecer a la familia
8055965 se pudo observar que la madera de la cruz posterior era mucho m s antigua y que ten a unas hojas met licas superpuestas aunque estaban renegridas y feas los joyeros pudieron determinar que eran de plata repujada con
8055966 se deduce que los apliques de plata no fueron reconocidos durante los ltimos 150 a os porque no se les menciona en la cr nica detallada de los redentoristas llegados en 1884 quienes confirmaron que la cruz del santo cristo fue restaurada en 1748
8055967 nos indica que estamos celebrando los 260 a os de esa restauraci n ya que por esa fecha vinieron a buga orfebres que le pusieron apliques de plata al sagrario de la iglesia mayor la catedral de san pedro
8055968 no podemos caer en un desorden generalizado ojal que el gobierno vaya dando las respuestas que se puedan dar y que se deban dar en las circunstancias actuales
8055969 no podemos continuar con pa os tibios hace falta que se d una respuesta clara categ rica contundente al asunto del narcotr fico
8055970 no ser a de extra ar que en este mbito se prepare un asalto al c digo civil para cambiar la definici n del matrimonio y por consiguiente de la familia fundada sobre l
8055971 en la d cada del veinte del siglo pasado en un contexto de cultura eugenista donde el temor era que el hijo de una mujer deficiente nacer a deficiente
8055972 hoy se sabe que no es as por lo menos no es necesariamente as y querer proyectar a toda clase de violaci n
8055973 de que la mujer tiene derecho sobre su cuerpo y que el ni o la criatura es una parte de su cuerpo
8055974 quiz s no se piensa tanto en el violador no s si hay verdadera diligencia en perseguir y condenar a esos sujetos a los cuales se los libera con demasiada facilidad y
8055975 se comprende lo que significa la violaci n para una mujer
8055976 esta idea es la que hay que recuperar hay que pensar en el ni o y debemos abrir paso cada vez m s en la opini n p blica a algo que es hoy d a una certeza cient fica y jur dica hay vida humana desde la concepci n y el embri n a n en el estadio nfimo de su desarrollo
8055977 sin el don de la vida no es posible ejercer otro derecho
8055978 la defensa de un ser humano reci n concebido debe acompa arse de la defensa de la dignidad de la mujer respetar el derecho a la vida se encuentra en la base de la aut ntica democracia y del verdadero estado de derecho
8055979 el respeto a la vida humana desde la concepci n y hasta la muerte natural
8055980 sin el don de la vida toda oportunidad se extingue
8055981 la dignidad humana no depende de la cultura raza sexo convicciones pol ticas creencias religiosas desarrollo de las capacidades intelectuales o edad de la persona todo ser humano posee la misma dignidad y merece el mismo respeto en sus derechos fundamentales
8055982 ninguna situaci n por excepcional que sea justifica que alguien lastime la dignidad de las personas en especial de las m s vulnerables las marginadas o indefensas la defensa valerosa de un reci n concebido debe estar acompa ada de la defensa igualmente decidida de la dignidad de la mujer que vive un embarazo inesperado
8055983 trabajar para que ninguna mujer se sienta condenada rechazada sola o abandonada al encontrarse en esa situaci n es un deber humano atender solidariamente a la mujer que lleva un hijo en su vientre de este acompa amiento depende en buena medida que el aborto no sea la opci n a escoger
8055984 hoy m s que nunca garantizar el derecho a la vida y de manera igual para todos es un deber de cuyo cumplimiento depende el futuro de la humanidad
8055985 cuando en una sociedad se debate la despenalizaci n del aborto lo que en el fondo se discute es el futuro de una naci n reconocer y respetar el derecho a la vida se encuentra en la base de la aut ntica democracia y del verdadero estado de derecho
8055986 la misi n que hoy tiene la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n al analizar las leyes que despenalizan el aborto en el distrito federal
8055987 como ciudadanos confiamos en que los se ores ministros cumplir n su labor con responsabilidad esperamos que su decisi n est orientada por la justicia el derecho la verdad y el bien com n
8055988 el derecho de una persona no debe prevalecer sobre el derecho de otra la defensa y promoci n de la vida es responsabilidad de todos en consecuencia corresponde ahora trabajar decididamente por una cultura de la vida que a nadie excluya el derecho a la vida y su respeto absoluto debe ser la base de nuestra democracia
8055989 nuestra iglesia no solo aplaude sino que har todo lo posible para apoyar el acuerdo nacional contra la violencia organizada
8055990 me parece una contradicci n que mientras se firma con bombo y platillo un acuerdo contra la violencia se nos amenace con declarar constitucional la violencia contra los m s inocentes que son los que est n en el vientre materno
8055991 ser una ayuda espiritual para esta iglesia diocesana y a la vez abrir un camino para que el sacerdote revise su actitud en esp ritu de humildad obediencia y comuni n
8055992 en distintas oportunidades incluido alg n medio de comunicaci n social se manifestaron acusaciones hacia sacerdotes de la di cesis faltando a la caridad cristiana y al don de la vocaci n sacerdotal regalo de dios sin pruebas concretas y que llevan a cometer graves injurias que atentan no s lo contra los presb teros sino tambi n contra la iglesia
8055993 la espiritualidad de comuni n y en favor de aquellos que tienen la vida y la fe amenazadas
8055994 causan perplejidad y llevan a pastores y fieles a preguntarse si dichas afirmaciones son compatibles con la ense anza del magisterio aut ntico de la iglesia
8055995 para hacer nuevas publicaciones o disponer la reedici n de publicaciones anteriores
8055996 la ense anza de disciplinas teol gicas en cualquier nivel de docencia incluyendo cursos cortos conferencias y toda otra actividad an loga
8055997 participar en la organizaci n y uso de medios de comunicaci n social incluyendo la internet ya sea a trav s de escritos grabaciones filmaciones y cualquier otro tipo de soporte
8055998 parece que fue ayer cuando entregu mi vida al se or jesucristo siendo llamado por el esp ritu santo para obedecerle y servirle como l quisiera sin embargo han pasado 57 a os desde que dios marc mi vida para siempre jam s so que el se or iba a darme la posibilidad de alcanzar tantas vidas para su reino

8056031 in 2002 a survey conducted by the colombia university national arts journalism program found that judging art is the least popular goal among american art critics and simply describing art is the most popular
8056032 i use the camera to describe a world i dont see everyday my intention is to reveal things which take time to witness and are generally overlooked we live in an age that compresses time and values immediacy i seek a prolonged alternative
8056033 art criticism can content itself with description but then it loses the run of itself becomes something else dissolves into the ocean of undifferentiated nonfiction writing on culture

8056273 is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8056274 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8056275 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8056276 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8056277 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8056278 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8056279 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8056280 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8056281 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8056282 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

8056288 the most marvelous runner to have sped over our roads

8056297 ultimately property rights and personal rights are the same thing the one cannot be preserved if the other be violated
8056298 i t may be that the fostering and protection of large aggregations of wealth are the only foundation on which to build the prosperity of the whole people large profits mean large pay rolls but profits must be the result of service performed in no land are there so many and such large aggregations of wealth as here in no land do they perform larger service in no land will the work of a day bring so large a reward in material and spiritual welfare

8056321 i thought that the guys came out today and tried to play with great effort
8056322 they flew around we still had a couple of mistakes but we have two days to clean that up but i thought the enthusiasm and effort was really good today we just need to keep doing that for the next two days
8056323 it makes the defense cover the whole field otherwise they can count on the backs to always be in protection and the linebackers can get underneath a route so its important that we use them to stretch the defense out
8056324 i thought that the last two days were very encouraging with deanthony

8056332 put on your big girl pants and deal with it
8056333 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8056334 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8056335 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8056336 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8056337 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8056338 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8056339 keterangan di atas pihak yang mendakwa dan sumpah di atas pihak yang menafikan yang kena dakwa
8056340 sesungguhnya dijadikan sumpah itu hak bagi pendakwa kerana dia merasa lawannya sudah merosakkan haknya dengan penafian itu oleh itu dia boleh meminta lawannya itu bersumpah kerana jika apa yang dia anggap itu betul maka lawannya sudah melakukan dua kerosakan pertama membuat sumpah dusta sebaliknya pula jika apa yang dianggap itu tidak betul maka lawannya itu akan mendapat pahala kerana membuat sumpah secara besar dengan menyebut dan membesarkan nama allah
8056341 orang yang kena dakwa tidak boleh bersumpah kecuali apabila diminta oleh pendakwa pendakwa tidak boleh berbuat demikian kecuali dalam kes yang keputusannya boleh dibuat apabila orang yang kena dakwa enggan bersumpah oleh itu tidak boleh diminta bersumpah dalam kes hudud kerana hakim tidak boleh membuat apa apa keputusan apabila berlaku keengganan nukul keengganan bersumpah nukul sudah disifatkan sebagai pengakuan dalam kes hudud yang menjadi hak allah secara mutlak membuat pengakuan sesudah menafikannya tidak boleh diterima lagi oleh itu hudud tidak sabit apabila berlaku enggan nukul
8056342 twitter the ham radio two way radio of today at
8056343 were excited about this day because its been a long time coming and were thrilled about it
8056344 we see ourselves as sort of the anchor store in the mall for the industrial park
8056345 in this building we will be building subsystems for vehicles that well deliver in 2009 and then also starting those subsystems for the vehicles that well deliver from the operations facility in 2010
8056346 right now we have five employees in elgin and were going to continue to ramp up as we bring more work into this initial facility when we get the main facility on line well have a staff of about 100 employees
8056347 we intend to bring as much work here as we can were excited about the workforce the community and the potential here
8056348 were going to do the non line of sight cannon and non line of sight mortar here were going to do the paladin integrated management system program here and were looking for other work thats appropriate to the facility that we can bring in here
8056349 on behalf of the 100 000 men and women of bae systems around the world its a pleasure to be able to welcome all of you here to our newest home here at the fort sill industrial park
8056350 as i look around at the progress thats being made here the one word that comes to mind is commitment
8056351 today were not just about celebrating the doors opening on the first phase of the fort sill industrial park but were celebrating a commitment to this outstanding community
8056352 we knew if we could cast the vision for establishing operations here the hard working people of oklahoma would take care of the rest weve walked the long road during the past decade but the building you see here is a demonstration that our commitment was unwavering and this community is on the verge of something great
8056353 to all of our soldiers with us today we are grateful for your tireless and inspiring commitment you have never let us down and we together with the people of southwest oklahoma pledge to serve you with the same dedication that begins right here with the opening of our new facility
8056354 vital to the continued success of the non line of sight cannon and ensuring the revolutionary capabilities of this system reach the hands of our soldiers as quickly as possible
8056355 what we want to do when that happens is start a massive rebuilding
8056356 there is no better location than elgin for the future development of field artillery as well as other elements of the armys future combat system
8056357 today is about our national security the future of our united states army and most importantly our soldiers the security environment of the 21st century is unclear we must ensure our soldiers have the equipment to meet all challenges in this dynamic security environment
8056358 we believe as it ramps up and a year from now is going full steam ahead that other industries will see how strong the community is how widereaching the area is in terms of the workforce and that they will be willing and looking forward to opportunities within this industrial park as well

8056392 the concern a lot of us have is relative to last year a large number of transactions involve houses that have been foreclosed on
8056393 its cold comfort to know that the banks are succeeding on selling their houses at prices that are pretty breathtaking
8056394 in places like california or florida many of the homes that are listed for sale can be classified as distressed
8056395 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market

8056413 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice
8056414 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8056415 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world
8056416 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8056417 there is no way you can dash or cancel or terminate a resolution of the security council by force
8056418 so in the space of three weeks russia has gone from reaffirming georgias territorial integrity to using military force to redraw the boundaries of georgia
8056419 but frankly territorial integrity was an essential part of that and russias actions today have put a massive block in the way of achieving a common security council position

8056428 over the past week i have been working closely with the commanders at fort sill to ensure all wtu issues are addressed and prompt action taken
8056429 i was particularly pleased to meet with several of the wounded warriors
8056430 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8056431 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8056432 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8056433 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8056434 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8056435 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8056436 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8056437 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers
8056438 want to hear what their political leaders are going to do to reduce it

8056441 helen fisher ph d anthropologist and author of why we love
8056442 making people feel like they are truly emotionally engaged that is far far more important than any feature i can suggest
8056443 far more important than technology far more important than storyline its not just wow my gun can fire 500 bullets rather than 400 bullets its wow ive just shot someone and that person relied on me or cared about me in this game and making you feel like you really have shot someone thats what i think is more important thats what i think as a designer i should be thinking about
8056444 the world definitely is much bigger and it also feels better
8056445 there are more things to do within each area and we absolutely have to make them interesting and absorbing too many times have i spent playing rpgs set in vast barren wastelands fable 2 retains the fable 1 organic intimate feel while giving players tons to explore and discover we are really trying to pack the world with exploration interaction and secrets
8056446 with kynapse non player characters can move around in any 3d dynamic world understand their environment hide communicate cooperate drive vehicles etc
8056447 think of water levels rising and opening new higher positioned locations that were inaccessible earlier or think a big hole in the ground that you can fall into
8056448 if the characters in fable one were yokel fable 2s are highwayman you start life in the slums in fact the opening sequence follows a bird soaring over the land into your city and then the bird shits and the camera follows the shit down down and it finally lands on the head of your character a small child scum in the citys gutter your character has a wonderful unconditional love for its sister but shes taken away from you mysteriously early into the story its here i should also introduce lucien as the baddie of the piece lucien is engaged in building a 50 mile high tower which he constructs through the 50 year story your characters quest for a sword will sooner or later bring him into contact with lucien
8056449 the first time you encounter the camp you might think that any decision you make on how to interact with it is insignificant but according to molyneux the effects of even your seemingly trivial actions will be felt for decades if you choose to trade with the camp for example you might find that it has developed into a small settlement when youre in the area again 10 years later after another decade that small settlement might grow into a village and ultimately it could become a thriving town or city if you decided to loot the camp and kill its inhabitants on the other hand the land it occupied would be reclaimed by nature and 10 years later youd never even know it was there
8056450 your offsprings appearance will be determined by your spouses characteristics and by your own at the time of conception and regardless of what path you choose to take through the game that child will love you unconditionally if youve opted to play as a woman itll be you that gets pregnant of course but thats a preview topic for another day
8056451 further they would imitate you whether youre good or evil
8056452 youll start out as a street urchin with absolutely nothing to lose your physical transformation as you become an adult in the game will be determined by a number of factors in addition to the requisite good evil mechanic including cruel kind deeds and whether you become rich or poor if you manage to accrue a significant amount of wealth in the game youll have the option to unlock additional game content by purchasing each and every building in the world including castles catacombs and the like if you never have more than two gold pieces to rub together your experience your appearance and the ways that people in the world react to you will be very different

8056504 that type of recruiting has taken a great leap forward on the web
8056505 it gives colleges an edge and keeps them relevant if colleges dont engage in this medium they simply risk missing a lot of students
8056506 we were just amazed at how well this worked beyond our wildest dreams
8056507 its been the single best performing ad campaign in the history of alliant
8056508 if i were to advertise in a major magazine with a general audience we just wouldnt get this return
8056509 ive seen cases where institutions devoted scarce resources to a blog while their main web site was subpar
8056510 in that kind of situation they would have been better off not diverting their resources to the new whiz bang technology
8056511 im not just sending somebody a flier and saying you figure it out
8056512 we feel we need to jump on board because a lot of our competitors are doing the same
8056513 it gives me an entr e into a much fuller way of knowing who they are
8056514 i can see what their background is where theyre located what they studied in college what their interests are i can see if theyre avid sports fans who might be a good fit for my program

8056520 yes there are a lot of people and corporations in this world who are greedy scum sucking bottom feeders who take advantage and dont give back isnt it incumbent on those of us who are compassionate kind and caring to make as much money as we can so that we can help those who suffer who would you rather see with money in this world people like us who actually care about humanity or people like them who want to squeeze others dry for their own profit and gain
8056521 sure i want to be rich but who wants to put in 80 hours a week to do it
8056522 sure i want to be rich but the irs is just going to bleed me dry im not going to give them the satisfaction

8056529 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8056530 this recognition violates georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia as well as to the six point peace plan brokered by french president nicolas sarkozy on behalf of the eu
8056531 canada supports the democratic and legitimate government of georgia russia must fulfil its international obligations reconsider its actions and co operate fully with the international community to resolve the crisis in georgia in a peaceful manner
8056532 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8056533 short of losing our dignity as a nation we couldnt act otherwise
8056534 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument

8056560 gold remains hesitant and is not getting clear direction from the dollar which is essentially flat
8056561 higher oil prices and weakness in equity markets should result in gold remaining well bid as this market session progresses but given the degree of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty anything can happen in these markets in the short term
8056562 having less and less effect at the moment as we run out of time before the high season in gold begins in the last quarter
8056563 the bottom line is that this lack of supply and huge demand will result in materially higher prices in the coming weeks
8056564 unprecedented and phenomenal level of shorting in recent weeks and this shorting was heavily concentrated amongst just a handful of players
8056565 the market place is presently divided into two parts the jewelers who have a little time to buy before they need to together with investment demand which waits for the price to be ready to rise before they go in
8056566 the other side are the short term traders on comex who take opportunities on both the up and down side of the market
8056567 last week saw them sell until they hit support below 800 then vigorous demand take the gold price back up over 800
8056568 right now they are deciding whether to knock the price down again or have they hit too large a support
8056569 as to international news affecting the gold price i personally only see news relevant to the monetary system and directly to gold buying or selling as being of importance
8056570 georgia and such troubles like iraq dont make people buy gold
8056571 it is becoming clearer that the problems of the monetary system where they affect the future value of the dollar are worsening but are also affecting other currencies

8056595 you can have a marginal well that makes significantly more than the 10 barrels or 60 mcf but because it produces a lot of saltwater or its very deep in nature it can be much more expensive income off that well becomes marginal even though the amount is larger
8056596 you can have a well thats real marginal but if you can get a tax break on the well it allows you to keep it pumping oil and gas
8056597 that is the objective of the legislation to make sure that even when prices are high you dont have to plug these wells that only produce a couple barrels per day
8056598 and we only have two that are not stripper wells even at the high prices for oil when you only produce a barrel every other day and you have saltwater to get rid of you get to the point where youre just not making any money on the well and eventually you end up plugging it
8056599 taken all together they still make a significant amount of oil and gas for our state and country
8056600 you get to the point where it doesnt do the government any good to tax you to a point where you have to plug that well even though the government always gets 7 percent gross production tax the income tax would be small or even nonexistent the government doesnt get any more money in forcing it to be plugged
8056601 americas marginal wells collectively produce half as much oil as america imports from saudi arabia each year and are an important part of the domestic energy security equation
8056602 should lutherans reserve the consecrated elements for the communion of the sick
8056603 no one may publicly teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call
8056604 the universal custom in roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy is for the priest to commune the sick and shut ins with previously consecrated elements
8056605 in the catholic church itself all possible care must be taken that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere always by all
8056606 a practice that is not mentioned in scripture and is not universal must be judged according to scripture
8056607 that the elements were consumed immediately after the end of the divine service
8056608 possibly at first the holy sacrament may have been consecrated in the presence of the sick person but of this in early times the instances are rare and by no means clear
8056609 put away inclosed reserved carried about displayed and put to other uses
8056610 put away reserve it carry it about or display it to others
8056611 shut them in reserve them carry them about and use them for display
8056612 therefore reservation of the consecrated eucharist without distribution and reception has not been received approved and observed either always or everywhere or by all as a catholic dogma and necessary custom
8056613 used simply without superstition and without a peculiar worship apart from use
8056614 a certain number of indulgences in return for reverence when it was carried to a sick person
8056615 a legend about basil which invents the fiction that he reserved the consecrated bread that it might be buried with him
8056616 the papalists nevertheless reserve parts from the easter or some other solemn communion for the sick for nearly a whole year
8056617 to separate the community in which the sacrament is consecrated from the community in which it is consumed
8056618 the question of what the elements are apart from their use is avoided
8056619 nothing has the nature of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by christ
8056620 it isnt being used anymore after the service so its just bread and wine because the confessions say so
8056621 people willing to trade freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both

8056628 the real id act then is about more than a drivers license it puts in place a set of standards for identity management idm that can be leveraged across an entire government organization to create an integrated citizen identity security program
8056629 no the government didnt have this stuff in place precisely because it had been working on it and knew its limitations and didnt find any value for the costs involved

8056633 of the 25 countries that have been most adversely affected by terrorism since 1986 eighty percent have national identity cards one third of which incorporate biometrics this research was unable to uncover any instance where the presence of an identity card system in those countries was seen as a significant deterrent to terrorist activity

8056642 the increase in memorandums is not surprising given the more challenging market conditions faced by many banking organizations

8056748 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8056749 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner

8056761 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8056762 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8056763 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8056764 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8056765 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement

8056916 sudah 20 tahun akta mahkamah syariah 1984 tidak dipinda menyebabkan orang ramai mengambil jalan mudah dengan mengaku bersalah kerana hukuman yang dikenakan ringan berbanding mahkamah sivil

8056986 we continue to see unprecedented growth in u s gas production that will eventually overwhelm the u s gas markets
8056987 even if that number were to increase 100 fold in the next ten years to 11 000 000 or roughly 5 percent of the entire vehicle market a formidable goal the impact on natural gas supplies and the natural gas delivery infrastructure would be small equating about 4 percent of total u s natural gas consumption

8056989 saya memang bersetuju isu memeluk islam bagi seorang saudara baru adalah suatu perkara besar dan membawa kesan yang berkekalan lantaran itu memang perlu seseorang yang memeluk islam memaklumkan kepada keluarga yang masih menganut agama asal
8056990 meskipun begitu biarlah mualaf berkenaan sendiri yang memilih cara dan masa yang sesuai untuk berbuat demikian memandangkan mereka sahaja yang benar benar tahu isi hati reaksi dan ramalan penerimaan keluarga masing masing
8056991 undang undang juga tidak seharusnya mencampuri hal berkenaan apatah lagi menjadikan pemberitahuan tersebut sebagai prasyarat untuk memeluk islam ujar zainul rijal ketika dihubungi
8056992 sekiranya sesuatu peraturan tersebut menafikan hak yang dijamin oleh perlembagaan maka peraturan sedemikian tidaklah elok digarap kata zainul rijal
8056993 justeru pada pendapat saya saudara baru perlu memaklumkan status agama mereka namun keperluan ini tidak perlu dijadikan peraturan sehingga menyukarkan serta mengancam keselamatan saudara baru itu sendiri
8056994 sungguhpun saya seorang peguam namun isu perebutan mayat boleh dielakkan daripada dipanjangkan kepada mahkamah untuk menjayakannya ketua ketua agama misalnya mufti dan paderi perlulah mengadakan rundingan hasil perbincangan boleh dipanjangkan kepada sultan ujar zainul rijal

8056996 oklahoma has long been known for its energy production from oil and gas fields
8056997 however the potential for renewable energy production from my home state is endless in my district alone we can provide animal and plant waste corn crops for conventional ethanol and the land to grow cellulosic crops for switch grass
8056998 one of the best components of this bill is the permanent extension of tax credits for alternative energy production
8056999 oklahoma is the ninth largest producer of wind and we look forward to continued growth in that industry i know that extending the production tax credit on wind energy will send the right message to wind producers that the american government is ready to work with them to expand upon this already successful alternative energy source

8057042 that goes a long way to explaining the low turnout in the primary
8057043 i would rather have had somebody different than john mccain on the republican side but i cant even believe who the democrats picked
8057044 i know our country will be in bad shape if barack obama is elected president
8057045 i know the news media give john mccain fits and are for barack obama but tell me what has barack obama done
8057046 honestly it amazed me when the republicans began talking about putting george bush on the ticket back in 1999
8057047 most likely hes done more damage to the republican party than anybody ever hes probably going to be the one who elects barack obama
8057048 i think we need a younger man with some ideas to change things up a little
8057049 as americans continue to suffer from high energy prices we need to take advantage of domestic resources of oil and natural gas
8057050 i am proud to work closely with congressman boren in introducing the bi partisan marginal well production preservation and enhancement act which will reduce our dependence on foreign oil by streamlining and clarifying government regulations prolonging economic feasibility and enhancing production volumes from marginal wells
8057051 marginal wells produced more than 335 million barrels of oil in 2006
8057052 thats equivalent to more than 60 percent as much as the united states imports annually from saudi arabia or 67 percent as much as the nation imports annually from venezuela in my own state of oklahoma it is the small independents basically mom and pop operations that produce the majority of oil and natural gas with 85 percent of oklahomas oil coming from marginal wells
8057053 every day hard working oklahomans are facing rising costs of energy and our country continues to be dependent on foreign nations for its energy needs congress must ensure that we are taking full advantage of every option available to increase our domestic energy supply
8057054 that is why im proud to join my colleague and fellow oklahoman senator jim inhofe in introducing the marginal well production preservation and enhancement act this legislation would help reduce our foreign dependence by prolonging and enhancing production from marginal wells even though marginal wells produce 15 barrels or less daily according to the interstate oil and gas compact commission they contribute nearly 18 percent of the oil and 9 percent of the natural gas produced in the u s most importantly the producers who operate marginal wells are smaller independent operations that assist local and state economies with job creation and added revenue streams this bill ensures that the nations policies recognize the economic importance and energy contribution of marginal well production
8057055 the oklahoma independent petroleum association appreciates the bipartisan leadership of senator inhofe and congressman boren as they work to make america more energy secure
8057056 by fixing the marginal well percentage depletion rate at 27 5 percent eliminating the net income limitation for percentage depletion allowing the accelerated depreciation of tertiary injectant properties and providing common sense regulatory relief this bill would help independent producers more effectively meet the demands of operating marginal wells and enhance producers ability to develop new domestic crude oil and natural gas resources
8057057 the national stripper well association would like to thank congressman boren and senator inhofe for sponsoring the marginal well production preservation and enhancement act
8057058 americas marginal wells collectively produce half as much oil as america imports from saudi arabia each year and are an important part of the domestic energy security equation we hope congress will consider this bipartisan bill as part of a comprehensive solution to our nations energy supply challenges
8057059 the state of oklahoma commission on marginally producing oil and gas wells would like to express its appreciation on behalf of oklahoma marginal oil and gas well operators to senator inhofe and congressman boren for their bipartisan leadership as they work to make america less dependent on foreign oil and improve national security
8057060 at this critical time this bill will help the independent producer more effectively meet growing market demands while operating in a cost effective manner this bill will allow operators to offset the rising cost of operations while making it possible to reinvest in new development of domestic oil and gas
8057061 with approximately 20 percent of american oil production and 10 percent of american natural gas production coming from marginal wells they are americas true strategic petroleum reserve however they remain americas most vulnerable production assets faced with the highest operating costs this legislation is designed to encourage and protect continuing operation these essential american resources
8057062 on behalf of the association of energy service companies i would like to extend my support to the marginal well production preservation and enhancement act introduced by senator inhofe and representative boren marginal wells are a vital resource to our domestic oil and gas industry and i applaud these congressmen for recognizing their importance and working to promote their use
8057063 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games this has yet to happen
8057064 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
8057065 if olympic hosts are permitted to curtail and manipulate information available to the games global audience that breach of trust will inevitably undermine the credibility of the olympics itself
8057066 there will be limitations on website access during games time
8057067 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related

8057071 reforms work in 2006 and 2007 identified that the balance of taxation and public spending has tilted against young people so that they now face an unfair burden without being able to expect many of the benefits and this at a time when their economic profile is already difficult they are also faced with increasing levels of debt from higher education much stronger labour market competition lower growth in earnings and acute difficulties in getting onto the property ladder
8057072 at present however ipods feel disconnected from the public realm they tend to vote in smaller numbers than other groups express more cynicism about government and politics overall and focus on the personal sphere rather than the political worryingly for politicians they do tend not to connect the ups and downs of their daily lives with the macroeconomic sphere or with decisions made in local government or in the house of commons so they tend not to look to politics to provide a credible answer to societys ills

8057127 republicans in congress may be out of gas but that doesnt mean conservative ideas arent percolating elsewhere and even on the supposedly democratic stronghold of health care
8057128 but the florida reform which both houses of the legislature approved unanimously renounces mr
8057129 its hard to believe but this qualifies as a revelation in the policy world of health insurance the new benefit packages will be introduced sometime next year and include minimum coverage for primary care and catastrophic expenses for major illness
8057130 critics are already saying that without mandates the plan wont guarantee quality of care
8057131 these government rules are imposed without regard for how much they will cost and who will bear the burden
8057132 and though the plan will only enroll those who have gone without coverage for six months it also creates a clearinghouse that will let small businesses that cant afford coverage offer their employees a variety of similar policies
8057133 despite his often populist brand of politics such as on hurricane insurance mr
8057134 some 13 states currently offer bare bones policies on a full or trial run basis
8057135 the florida success also shows the political benefits when republicans talk seriously about health care mr crist has made increasing consumer choice a signature issue when mr mccain talked up his health care reforms earlier this spring he did so in tampa he chose the right state
8057136 prinsip membayar ganti rugi kepada pemiutang disebabkan kemudaratan yang dialaminya dengan sebab kelewatan penghutang membayar hutangnya adalah prinsip dapat diterima dan tidak didapati nas syarak dari sudut usul dan tujuan syariah mengharuskannya dan syarat penghutang dikenakan ganti rugi adalah disebabkan kelewatan pembayaran bukannya keuzuran yang diharuskan oleh syarak
8057137 penghutang yang enggan membayar hutang kehormatannya harus dijejaskan dan dikenakan hukuman terhadapnya
8057138 orang islam terikat dengan syarat mereka persetujui kecuali syarat menghalalkan yang haram dan mengharamkan yang halal maka persetujuan bekas suami yang dijadikan perintah adalah sah dan mengikat beliau untuk membayar dalam tempoh ditetapkan
8057139 seniors unfortunately are often targets of fraud because of the lifetime of savings they have collected
8057140 i am grateful for my colleagues support in protecting our most vulnerable citizens
8057141 we kept our promise to the people of florida and crafted a thoughtful budget that is both compassionate and fiscally responsible
8057142 it was not an easy task but the leadership of the house made a commitment early on to address the state budget the same way families all over florida are addressing their personal budgets we focused on preserving the core missions of government we reduced spending to a level floridians can afford and we didnt raise taxes or recklessly spend all of our savings we stayed focused all session on making florida affordable again and getting the states economy moving and this budget helps us meet those goals while protecting floridas future
8057143 the leadership of the florida house of representatives made a commitment to the taxpayers of florida and we delivered on that promise
8057144 despite the best efforts of democrats to raise taxes expand gambling and abandon responsibility on the budget we decided to focus on the needs of floridians not the wants of governments the budget we approved today is fiscally responsible and sets an example of how other states and our country should react in challenging economic times and the approach we took will play a major factor in revitalizing our economy
8057145 the world is getting flatter and smaller and competing with school systems in our own country is just not good enough anymore
8057146 the legislation approved today will refresh our curriculum with proven enhancements that are currently working all over the world so that the next generation of florida students can compete and thrive in a global setting
8057147 accountability must remain a key component of our education system we want parents and teachers to have a concrete understanding of what their kids are supposed to be learning and whether or not they are learning it
8057148 over the past eight years republicans in the house have increased per student funding by more than 41 and through accountability driven reforms we have seen remarkable improvement in our schools
8057149 we have made a historic investment in our schools but we also recognized that when it comes to education it isnt how much you spend but rather how wisely you spend it that matters most the reforms approved today will help us spend each penny wisely on a refocused school system that better prepares our kids for work for college and for life
8057150 for our kids to succeed and emerge as global leaders they need a balanced curriculum that builds on a rigorous foundation of advanced language math and science skills as well as stressing civics instruction and foreign languages and continues to build on this base year after year
8057151 floridas education system is leading the nation in accountability driven reforms but we recognize that reform is never final
8057152 this legislation reflects all that we have learned and applies it toward building an education system that doesnt just lead the nation but competes to lead the world
8057153 provides that fcat writing be administered no earlier than the week of march 1 all other fcat assessments be administered no earlier than april 15 and student test results be reported by the week of the first monday in june
8057154 requires instructional materials to demonstrate alignment to the new standards
8057155 67 of all people get health insurance through their employers the house plan will expand that number by helping small businesses and their employees purchase health care coverage while the governors plan offers affordable insurance to individual floridians who are uninsured
8057156 passing both plans together gives floridians the greatest number of options and will ensure that the maximum number of floridians will have access to quality affordable health care
8057157 our goal was always to complement the good work product suggested by governor crist to provide floridians with more options and greater choices
8057158 no one is sure when we will get the next opportunity to vote for expanded health insurance options instead of limiting floridians to just one approach we went the extra mile to propose a bold plan to reach as many uninsured floridians as possible
8057159 florida health choices is an innovative public private partnership a marketplace creating a new environment for buying and selling health insurance and health services
8057160 using competitive market principles florida health choices uses simple common sense principles to empower consumers with buying power increase choice foster competition and expand information on price and quality
8057161 participation in florida health choices will be voluntary and open to small businesses municipalities with less than 50 000 population school boards in fiscally constrained counties and statutory rural hospitals
8057162 once employers enroll in florida health choices resources for health benefits are placed in the hands of employees who can choose the best use of those resources to suit their individual needs
8057163 insurance plans and products purchased through florida health choices will be individual and portable allowing employees to maintain coverage even if they change jobs
8057164 florida health choices puts trust in consumers not government to determine the best way to purchase coverage and health services for them and their families
8057165 transparent pricing and a competitive environment provide the foundation for affordable health care products
8057166 regulatory relief will serve as an additional tool for stimulating affordability as well as
8057167 the florida health choices program will be administered by the florida health choices corporation a private entity that will create and implement the marketplace the corporation helps provide oversight to ensure that transparency and fair practices are maintained to protect consumers
8057168 the corporation will provide administrative services to employers allowing them to offer more affordable choices to their workers without having to maintain expensive human resource capabilities
8057169 the bill appropriates 1 5 million to provide start up costs for the corporation which is expected to be self sustaining in the future
8057170 a shared resource for small employers and their employees throughout florida the corporation will ensure that the health care choices offer real value to consumers
8057171 the florida health choices program offers common sense protections for floridians
8057172 the office of insurance regulation oir will review risk bearing products and provide comments to help consumers evaluate the products
8057173 the goals of the florida health choices program are to encourage competition offer more affordable choices to consumers provide individual and portable coverage and make price and quality information transparent to consumers who control the decisions about use of resources for health care
8057174 the code does not state that zina is equivalent to liwat which is sex between a man and another man
8057175 this means that mohd saiful would have had to accuse anwar and someone else not anwar and himself of zina

8057182 historic properties in downtown pensacola are a valuable asset to our city
8057183 this legislation makes it easier for uwf to manage the properties on a day to day basis and simplifies the process of applying and qualifying for alternative funding from grants
8057184 our students should not be contributing to nor legitimizing such a blatant system of apartheid nor should they be used in what is merely a propaganda and public relations ploy by a sworn enemy of america which shares the unsavory distinction of other rogue states such as iran and north korea of being included on the state departments list of terrorist nations i am certain that most americans would cringe at the thought of their children participating in a mahmoud ahmadinejad or kim jong il scholarship program
8057185 someone who puts their integrity aside puts blinders on to the human rights abuses ignores the hundreds of thousands of people executed murdered tortured or imprisoned by the castro regime and goes to cuba to receive a free medical degree from one of the last bastions of communist tyranny doesnt deserve the privilege to practice as a doctor in florida

8057211 rather than take the easy way out by continuing to spend without accountability the budget we approved today reins in government spending and preserves the tax relief our families and our economy need we also put the precious taxpayer dollars we do have where they are needed most toward the education of our children the safety of our communities and the healthcare of our most vulnerable most importantly this budget positions our state to come out of this economic downturn stronger

8057313 what were really doing is just saying thank you saying thank for all the work they do they dont get told thank you enough
8057314 most all of them are gone from home quite a lot of the time and away from their family so just to be appreciated of what you do
8057315 its a very stable job its one of the things were not going to see it being exported to china or mexico or anything place like that were going to need mechanics to work on these trucks for all years to come
8057316 something that maybe the public will realize that were not just out there bothering people were really doing something
8057317 can be overpowering too much airbrush too many effects distracting textures
8057318 but thats a problem with the colorist not photoshop a little restraint goes a long way
8057319 after id done as few stories and covers that were colored by other people i started asking the editors if i could do my own guides
8057320 most of them were agreeable there was some resistance when i asked to do guides for the outsiders story the editor was okay with it but called back rather sheepishly and explained that id have to send in some samples before theyd let me do it
8057321 first colorists are now colorist separators if im doing my own coloring i dont have to work with a separator i can get exactly the results i want secondly if im working with a colorist it can be a real collaboration they send the separations to me and i can make changes before the story sees print in the old days you didnt see the mistakes until it was too late
8057322 there are fewer hands spoiling the broth but back then no one saw what the colors would look like until the book was on press the guides were done with watercolor or marker and the separator was working with film running proofs was expensive and time consuming so you had to just imagine what it would look like when it was printed
8057323 i wouldnt want to recreate the separations with the old process
8057324 the only thing worse than that would be those zipatone overlays that we used for hand separations at fantagraphics tedious doesnt begin to describe that process
8057325 it didnt seem to overpower the line work as much as modern coloring can the limited palette pushed us towards a visual shorthand that works well with comics
8057326 but we can still do that with photoshop editors are resistant to it and sometimes insist on but i like seeing a variety of approaches from flat coloring to heavily modeled my own work tends to be somewhere in between
8057327 when they started printing on the good paper with offset presses instead of letterpress many of the old coloring rules had to be discarded
8057328 the colors were no longer subdued by the soft light tan paper everything became too bright and intense in the old days subtlety in color choices had been discouraged but now its essential if you dont want to blind the readers
8057329 when baxter paper was introduced new possibilities seemed to be opening up one of the nicest things about the offset printing was that the blacks were finally solid black as much as i like the letterpress newsprint look it was very inconsistent we all got used to seeing the black ink looking like a dark gray if any of the four colors were run a little light on the press it threw everything off
8057330 id like to see some books printed on off white paper i think most of us who grew up reading books on newsprint are still put off by the bright white paper
8057331 my yardstick is still the silver age dc comics covers they used a little airbrush but generally the effect was created with flat colors i think they still look great today
8057332 because its too time consuming and expensive when you compare it to photoshop

8057348 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8057349 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8057350 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8057351 im very very happy because just to be here and to be able to compete for me its already a great achievement
8057352 after beijing i thought i might not be able to compete here so without so much practice i thought i did pretty well
8057353 when i went first on the court i was very excited and i started to play really well obviously the lack of practice showed a bit later but i am just so thrilled to have an opportunity to slowly get into tournament and improve

8057362 i wanted to make sure that the bag could transition seamlessly from work to the playground
8057363 and so worked on integrating features like the snap out laptop holder the removable changing pad and the new low profile handles to give dads a multifunctional bag that didnt scream baby on board
8057364 details like an adjustable shoulder strap and antique brass hardware take the style quotient to the next level
8057365 when we first saw photos of this rugged leather satchel we referred to it as the diaper bag indiana jones might carry now that weve held it in our hands we know that the harrison ford worthy exterior belies a truly swank interior invest in this bag and you may not need to buy another one for years new baby or no new baby
8057366 the scout journey pack is a great baby bag for stylish dads it features absolutely tons of pockets and comes with a water resistant changing pad and a cool antique brass wipes case
8057367 this is a well tailored and beautifully designed baby hold all based around a single strap system in a classic satchel style the scout features detachable bottle pockets a matching embossed wipe case changing pad and it still has room to fit all of juniors needs with space left over
8057368 i just stumbled upon this fantastic bag the scout rubicon rucksack in black buffalo by petunia pickle bottom the perfect options for the dad on the go
8057369 can you believe this is a diaper bag the journey pack from petunia pickle bottoms scout collection isnt too pretty to deliver its billed as a bag that dads wont object to toting around but a minimalist mother will surely appreciate the sophisticated subtlety too
8057370 crews when they arrived a short period of time after they were told there was a child inside
8057371 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8057372 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8057373 where the evidentiary facts in the case before us make up a thin indeed in
8057374 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
8057375 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
8057376 we feel like weve been managing our business very well and cutting expenses
8057377 its a really tough retail environment out there but we managed to improve our results
8057378 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
8057379 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
8057380 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
8057381 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
8057382 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools

8057384 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8057385 it was a hard decision because i know how hard hes working to get back
8057386 the smart thing for us to do and for him is to do it this way and to give him that extra time and make sure when he in fact comes back on the field that he is ready to go
8057387 we tried to treat it and just last week we realized it was a little worse off than what we thought
8057388 you go back and look through the years its amazing how many kids have made a team on the last game
8057389 there have been players who lose jobs because of that game the thing we want to do is get them on the field be able to look at plays and evaluate those kids without having to make those decisions strictly off practice
8057390 weve got a lot of young guys who are fighting for positions on this team
8057391 like weve talked about the entire training camp you try to put as much competition together and try to let the decisions play themselves out on the field
8057392 i dont believe in just bringing camp bodies in so i would like to think that every guy in that locker room feels like they have a legitimate opportunity to make our club i hope there are a bunch of guys feeling like they have to perform on thursday just like they have to do every time they step on the field
8057393 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
8057394 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
8057395 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies
8057396 if hes locating and we feel he can make the next step then were going to do it
8057397 did not rule out chamberlain being activated after that bullpen session
8057398 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
8057399 god save this county save this court and give us a right mind amen
8057400 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
8057401 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8057402 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8057403 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8057404 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8057405 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8057406 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8057407 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8057408 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8057409 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8057410 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8057411 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming
8057412 yeah i thought we had a really good preseason were excited about our execution
8057413 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offense has started for us at camp
8057414 usually the defense is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8057415 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys
8057416 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8057417 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game
8057418 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok
8057419 if he fell over he must have bounced 12 times
8057420 were going to be interviewing family members and close associates and reviewing surveillance tapes from nearby businesses to see if we can determine a timeline
8057421 given the fact that none of the landowners want a fence and the fact that the government is under marching orders to build a fence
8057422 this is something we ought to work out to accommodate both parties needs
8057423 my concern is how and which city employees are going to be able to get down there on a daily basis
8057424 mess with me one more time and you will feel the fury of an angry puertorrican
8057425 the emotional keynote of most europeans is the feeling that man belongs to the state
8057426 as a property to be used and disposed of in compliance with his natural metaphysically determined fate a typical american can never fully grasp that kind of feeling an american is an independent entity emotionally an american has no concept of service or of servitude to anyone even if he enlists in the army and hears it called service to his country his feeling is that of a generous aristocrat who chose to do a dangerous task
8057427 is that barack obama wont be buried in a landslide hes more likely to be elected in one
8057428 these are so contradictory that approval on some issues necessitates disapproval on others
8057429 a matter of a single fundamental issue the imperative necessity to defeat george mcgovern i e statism
8057430 saw the obscene spectacle of altruisms essence sacrifice and surrender
8057431 is any reference to the freedom political liberty or individual rights that made americas enormous wealth and scientific achievements possible
8057432 he is not by any measure a friend of life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness
8057433 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8057434 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8057435 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8057436 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
8057437 senti bill non puoi startene l per le strade vieni a cantare nella band
8057438 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8057439 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8057440 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8057441 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8057442 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8057443 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8057444 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8057445 qualunque strada tu scelga con chiunque tu scelga di condividerla mi basta che tu sia felice vorrei poter dire che questo il mio desiderio pi profondo ma in realt purtroppo non ho un carattere cos equilibrato la mia immagine cos come si riflette nei tuoi occhi insieme forte e delicata come quella di un eroe dei fumetti troppo perfetta per essere vera

8057448 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8057449 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8057450 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8057451 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8057452 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8057453 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8057454 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8057455 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8057456 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8057457 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8057458 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8057459 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8057460 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8057461 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8057462 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8057463 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8057464 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8057465 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8057466 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8057467 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8057468 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8057469 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8057470 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8057471 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8057472 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8057473 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8057474 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8057475 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8057476 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8057477 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8057478 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8057479 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8057480 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8057481 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8057482 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8057483 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8057484 seeing all those sweet little babies in the nicu and hearing horror stories from some of the other mothers about how little milk they were able to produce started to make me feel pretty guilty
8057485 here i had this overabundance of milk and the mother next to me had almost nothing i couldnt just pour the bottles down the drain
8057486 from my first visit to the site i was completely touched
8057487 i really connected with the founders story of how she started the organization and as tired as i was from the emotional roller coaster of our nicu experience and as daunting as the process seemed i just felt like this was what i needed to do
8057488 i felt very connected to the mission of the milk project and excited to be a part of it though there was a small pang of fear when it was all packed up and ready to be shipped it was completely irrational fear like
8057489 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8057490 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8057491 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8057492 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8057493 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8057494 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8057495 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8057496 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8057497 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8057498 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8057499 crafting this album with a vocalist rather than an emcee was more of an open pallete like our instrumental music rather than our hip hop stuff it gives room for the music to branch off in any direction and breathe a lot more
8057500 the best heartbreaking horrifying slab of downtempo ive heard in quite some time
8057501 the beats are constructed with expertise balancing sampled elements and originals to impressive effect
8057502 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misapproriating this administration would take the gold world records we cannot afford another republican administration
8057503 zara was sitting awake playing on a nintendo ds she was absent mindedly talking to herself about sonic the hedgehog she looked up soon after though and her eyes suddenly went dull and cold locking onto toni like a homing device about to launch a missile
8057504 suddenly a huge lorry ploughed through the front of the house

8057509 tools and insights on professional development quality of life and career issues that impact every lawyers success and satisfaction
8057510 when i help people i like to see them smile and happy when i am leave my favorite was when we went to elementary schools because they really look up to student athletes i feel like i can be a role model to them
8057511 it is important to us that our student athletes become active members of our community fresno and the central valley have been so wonderful to us over the years and we feel it is our responsibility to give back to this great community
8057512 wherever there are safety concerns for athletes i am there
8057513 i make a lot of adjustments roughly 15 20 for the first practice
8057514 you have to be sure and wash the clothes at just the right water temperature
8057515 i have been doing this job for 26 years and ive been at fresno state for 17
8057516 you have to be sensitive to all athletes needs and an understanding of extremely high expectations you wont always be in the fore front but i like it that people count on me
8057517 the key is to be organized and even tempered we want athletes to feel at home when they are on the road
8057518 when athletes see what you do and the service they gain a new level of respect
8057519 it is fantastic to create new opportunities for men and women and offer a wide variety of sports it makes the athletic department and this university all the better

8057527 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade when whether youre looking at it scientifically or theologically if he were to come and say help me out here madam speaker what would you tell him
8057528 the notion that the catholic church declared abortion a sin at the same time as the pill is patently absurd and shows that pelosi has either lied about studying the issue in terms of church history or lied about what she found
8057529 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance
8057530 the catholic catechism is extremely clear on the nature of its position on human life and has been remarkably consistent on this point for almost 2 000 years and it finds that position in the old testament
8057531 in psalm 51 david refers to his sinfulness beginning at the moment of conception and sinfulness requires physical life and a soul to exist
8057532 but wait a minute the catholic church at the moment feels she strongly that life begins at the point of conception
8057533 a persons historical perspective begins with the day they were born
8057534 well its been a bone of contention a controversy in the church for 50 years
8057535 of course i understand the sanctity of life im pro life and so forth but i cannot impose my political will my religious views on people i cannot impose my religious views on the rest of the country
8057536 i dont know what steps publicly the catholic church takes in a situation like this but the first thing that is going to happen is american catholics are going to hear about it on this program
8057537 mans dignity therefore requires him to act out of conscious and free choice as moved and drawn in a personal way from within and not by blind impulses in himself or by mere external constraint
8057538 rush is frequently lacking in charity and as intelligent human beings we can say that his criticism of pelosi for hubris and arrogance rings somewhat hollow
8057539 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization

8057546 there are many ways that a legal couple status may support a relationship more family understanding acceptance by friends and co workers greater commitment that results from a public declaration and enhanced legal protections in the form of healthcare benefits and community property
8057547 the results of this first study on the topic suggest that same sex partners who legalized their relationships in vermont may have been more committed to each other or functioning better prior to obtaining a civil union or that civil union status itself is helping to preserve their relationships future research will help clarify whether various legal statuses actually increase the likelihood that lesbian and gay couples stay together
8057548 in contrast to old myths about same sex couples being deficient or less viable than male female couples this research project shows that same sex partners who seek to legalize their relationships actually may be among the best functioning couples in this society
8057549 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8057550 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8057567 miami based psystar owned by rudy pedraza will sue apple under two federal laws designed to discourage monopolies and cartels the sherman antitrust act and the clayton antitrust act saying apples tying of the mac os to apple labeled hardware is an anti competitive restrain of trade according to attorney colby springer of antitrust specialists carr amp ferrell

8057598 our scores compared to the rest of the nation speak volumes about the quality of education students in this state are receiving
8057599 its so tricky now with all the ballparks and the different dimensions
8057600 the umpires are not enough they cant always pick it up you have all these quirks that make it so difficult i cant tell sometimes and players cant tell sometimes i believe its the way to go you want to get it right
8057601 my three partners were adamant that the ball was foul
8057602 very very tough call you got all the fans down there standing around the pole hands up actually sometimes you can almost get blocked out we want to make sure we try to get it right
8057603 when i turned first and i was about to step on second the umpire called safe like the plays still live
8057604 i tried to get to third with a standup triple but third base coach mike quade waved me home i was like no way i was using my last breath to get to third and he wants me to go home i just kept going and i just got there
8057605 theres no need for that type of confusion in a big league ballpark
8057606 its nothing against the umpires or trying to take away the human element of the game im for getting the call right because theres so much at stake lets not have something happen at a very pivotal moment that changes the course of history for a particular franchise
8057607 i could just tell by the reaction of all the guys in the dugout and by the reaction of all the baltimore guys that it was a home run
8057608 well i did tonight i didnt want it the other night against the mets im torn
8057609 i think it should be for the home run and the home run only i actually think it would be a quicker decision and it would speed up the game
8057610 that is what replay is going to be there for
8057611 i tried to tell him to ask for help they agreed it was a home run
8057612 everybody missed it i dont argue unless i need to argue because i knew the truth it was right in front of me i knew it was a foul ball thats why there is all the talk about instant replay
8057613 thats a huge impact i mean some guy hits a three run homer a legitimate three run homer and you get nothing for it i think they should look at it as long as you dont turn it into a fiasco i think its good i dont have any problem with that
8057614 i dont think its going to take time away from the game no more so than when they meet and are standing there and nothing is resolved anyway now they can meet stuff will be resolved and we can go forward
8057615 its nothing against the umpires or trying to take away the human element of the game im for getting the call right because theres so much at stake lets not have something happen at a very pivotal moment that changes the course of history for a particular franchise

8057656 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8057657 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8057658 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

8057691 im just so thrilled to be here and to have the opportunity to play because after the olympics it was obviously very disappointing said the roland garros champion who was forced to withdraw from the games with the thumb injury
8057692 after beijing i thought you know i might not be able to compete here i really tried to do everything possible for my recovery i even went to australia to see my doctor and to be able to practice
8057693 but they found a few cysts that were causing inflammation the doctor just did lots of treatment to me he is also a chiropractor so he fixed my back and my neck and everything was so connected
8057694 before i had no power in my hand i couldnt hold my racquet finally my powers back and the inflammation started to calm down the last couple of days ive been totally without the pain so it was really good said the player who still limits her training to a sparse one hour per day
8057695 i had holidays and i was really motivated to start working hard and to get my form back and to compete i think i started too fast and too much and i got obviously injured
8057696 i was so much looking forward to olympics and was very excited to compete there when i had to pull out it was probably one of the hardest days of my career

8057704 thats not just cancer related to melanoma or other skin cancers
8057705 for prostate cancer the trend was in the direction of increased risk but the association was weaker and not statistically significant
8057706 people who have suboptimal ability to repair dna damage that the sun can cause are far more likely to get nonmelanoma skin cancer we are hypothesizing that that might also be the link to why there is a greater increased cancer risk in general
8057707 it is not unreasonable to suppose that patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers especially if diagnosed when the patient is young puts that person in a higher risk category of systemic cancers
8057708 in addition these patients are followed closely for further skin cancers and therefore may have an increased diagnosis of other cancers because they are plugged into the medical system
8057709 then youre in the wrong species love be a duck
8057710 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote

8057712 the board is working toward a substantial release of value to shareholders in 2010 which will coincide with gpgs 20th anniversary and my own retirement as chairman of the company
8057713 arguably misplaced investment judgment where prospects of recovery are more remote and where cost exceeds market value
8057714 that is supported by substantial undrawn credit lines so gpg is well placed for selective buying opportunities
8057715 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 22 million which is purely international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result

8057723 it is time for a total change in washingtons world view
8057724 that will require more than a great soldier it will require a wise leader
8057725 if you do not attempt to change the status quo by negotiations theres only one option
8057726 actually two options left status quo bogged down for decades losing our blood and treasure or war if john mccain has ruled out talking that means were going to get more of what weve had for most of the
8057727 instead of regime change we should focus on conduct change
8057728 it also requires a more sophisticated understanding that by publicly engaging iran including through direct talks we can exploit cracks within the ruling elite and between irans rulers and its people who are struggling economically and stifled politically
8057729 este es el problema las minas de rajo abierto son m s y m s profundas y las leyes del mineral en una escala global son cada vez menores
8057730 muchas de las nuevas minas subterr neas que est n proyectadas son muy profundas muy grandes y en algunos casos con rocas muy malas y las inversiones que se tienen que hacer en tiempo y dinero son incre bles

8057747 david twowy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
8057748 the chronicles of riddick was presented as a three part trilogy that would answer pitch black in the same way that lord of the rings answered the hobbit
8057749 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it
8057750 it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
8057751 sooner or later we all end up in the underverse
8057752 oh how i love your law it is my meditation all the day your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies for it is ever with me i have more understanding than all my teachers for your testimonies are my meditation i understand more than the aged for i keep your precepts i hold back my feet from every evil way in order to keep your word i do not turn aside from your rules for you have taught me how sweet are your words to my taste sweeter than honey to my mouth

8057760 its the first time something like this happens whatever theyre doing is bad someone should go to jail for that
8057761 mr macs commitment to the blue jackets our fans and this community was deep rooted and it will be a privilege for all of us to honor him this season and beyond
8057762 this mark will serve as a reminder to all of us to continue to work every day towards accomplishing the goals he set for this organization both on and off the ice
8057763 i think the most powerful thing for me im 27 and never in my lifetime did i think i would see this let alone have front row seats to watch history happen
8057764 and to listen to both ted kennedy and michelle obama speak last night you know it is a culmination of my grandparents vision for america meeting my future for america so it was just very moving very heart wrenching
8057765 i have never been so optimistic i have never been so engaged i have never been so motivated

8057773 so many things now have embedded systems from mobile phones to whitegoods which raises the problem that the cost of continuing improvements is more than one company can bear
8057774 we get to have our name out front of all of these people and we become well known and by winning we become a well respected entity too
8057775 nicta would like to continue entering the artemis orchestral competition but its not really our core activity so we would like to sponsor some university projects
8057776 taking your beliefs moral and political and working them into your fiction and why your beliefs have caused you to write a book of this nature
8057777 thats impossible at some level one must know what one believes and this must inevitably come across in the writing
8057778 all great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning great works are often born on a street corner or in a restaurants revolving door
8057779 without freedom no art art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself and dies of all others
8057780 without culture and the relative freedom it implies society even when perfect is but a jungle this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future
8057781 all great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning
8057782 without freedom no art art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself and dies of all others
8057783 without culture and the relative freedom it implies society even when perfect is but a jungle this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future
8057784 you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life
8057785 ship him to the coroners office theres no return address on this shipping bill where the hell did he come from
8057786 tem fogo pergunta o cara tenho responde a mo a ent o cospe drag o
8057787 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
8057788 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
8057789 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
8057790 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
8057791 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
8057792 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
8057793 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
8057794 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
8057795 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
8057796 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
8057797 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
8057798 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
8057799 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
8057800 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
8057801 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
8057802 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
8057803 because of my greater struggles i will have even greater blessings
8057804 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8057805 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8057806 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8057807 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8057808 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8057809 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8057810 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8057811 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8057812 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that
8057813 it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class
8057814 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8057815 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8057816 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8057817 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8057818 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8057819 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8057820 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8057821 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8057822 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8057823 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8057824 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8057825 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8057826 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8057827 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8057828 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8057829 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8057830 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8057831 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8057832 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8057833 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8057834 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8057835 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8057836 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8057837 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8057838 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8057839 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8057840 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8057841 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8057842 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8057843 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8057844 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8057845 primeiramente postulemos que o inferno exista e que esse o lugar para onde v o algumas almas
8057846 s irei pra cama com voc no dia que o inferno congelar
8057847 a mente que se abre a uma nova id ia jamais volta ao seu tamanho original
8057848 s irei pra cama com voc no dia que o inferno congelar
8057849 virtually all the ex shop and cafe staff will be re employed at the new centre which has been one of steves other hopes over the past months
8057850 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8057851 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8057852 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8057853 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8057854 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8057855 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8057856 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8057857 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8057858 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8057859 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8057860 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8057861 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8057862 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8057863 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8057864 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8057865 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8057866 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8057867 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8057868 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8057869 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8057870 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8057871 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8057872 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8057873 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8057874 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8057875 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8057876 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
8057877 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
8057878 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
8057879 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
8057880 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
8057881 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8057882 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8057883 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8057884 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8057885 i cant refute the ugly truth about niggers so ill hurl
8057886 gridando e correndo per le vie di messina insieme e bellissime come non mai
8057887 i think hes a genuine person i think hes been through a lot in his life it would mean a lot to him and to me for him to be in the final
8057888 sh t mo i never thought you had it in you to be so good
8057889 i dont like him like that dont get me wrong
8057890 its not about you every time dude it takes more than just you to get someone to the final dude
8057891 first rule is everyone can stay in bed for two hours
8057892 i love my friends so much and when friends say things about me it makes me very very sad
8057893 and its with a very special man hes unique hes a very special man mario and i love him to bits
8057894 i think you are actually quite not attractive like youre an ugly b ch
8057895 i just dont get darnell at all now i really dont im so confused
8057896 would you flash your t tties for one million dollars
8057897 how can you call me a sl t when you dont know me thats so rude darnell you are so rude
8057898 well you called me a sl t and you called me an ugly b tch and i know you meant it so probably not
8057899 can you just stop it what have i done to you
8057900 you just take everything to heart you are so paranoid you are f ing up friendships
8057901 cant wait for him to get out and see its him
8057902 soy una gran creyente creo que ella debe haber tenido un ngel guardi n estoy tan feliz
8057903 we are working on some bugs which affect around 2 of the iphones shipped and hope to have a software update soon
8057904 the product is just 6 weeks old and already weve seen two software updates so clearly the company is working to resolve issues that exist with the iphone 3g
8057905 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8057906 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8057907 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8057908 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8057909 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8057910 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
8057911 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8057912 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8057913 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8057914 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8057915 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8057916 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
8057917 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
8057918 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
8057919 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
8057920 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
8057921 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8057922 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8057923 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8057924 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
8057925 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8057926 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8057927 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8057928 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8057929 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8057930 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8057931 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8057932 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8057933 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8057934 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8057935 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8057936 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
8057937 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
8057938 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8057939 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8057940 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8057941 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8057942 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8057943 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8057944 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8057945 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8057946 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8057947 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8057948 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8057949 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8057950 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8057951 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8057952 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8057953 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8057954 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8057955 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8057956 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8057957 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8057958 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8057959 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8057960 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8057961 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8057962 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8057963 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8057964 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8057965 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

8057982 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8057983 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8057984 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

8057987 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8057988 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

8057991 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8057992 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8057993 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8057994 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8057995 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8057996 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8057997 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8057998 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8057999 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8058000 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8058001 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8058002 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8058003 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8058004 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8058005 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

8058016 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
8058017 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure

8058020 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8058021 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8058022 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8058023 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward

8058066 its official barack obama has received no bounce in voter support out of his selection of sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
8058067 there was liable to be a bit of a near term backlash whenever obama announced his vp choice provided that the vp was not hillary clinton
8058068 if hillary is able to rally her supporters to the obama biden ticket tonight there could still be a latent lagged vp bounce for obama that gets rolled up into his convention bounce

8058078 thanks to the dedication and collaboration of aeonsolar evergreen solar pv powered ibew turner construction and the dncc we have been able to provide clean renewable solar power to the pepsi center and raise awareness on renewable sources of energy to those attending the democratic national convention
8058079 were thrilled to be involved with the democratic party on its biggest stage
8058080 there is tremendous legislative support in both parties and both chambers for renewable energy and were hopeful that federal legislators see the benefits in extending the investment tax credit for renewable energy beyond 2008
8058081 there is great importance in being part of the democratic convention to showcase the practical use of solar energy to our nations leaders and also for the democratic party to set an example for clean and responsible energy use
8058082 we are pleased with the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2009 for several reasons we were able to manage dynamic growth while achieving both gross and operating margins at record high levels additionally we increased our investment in r amp d and approached completion of our previously announced factory expansion our backlog remains strong and we continue to see a robust order pipeline in both of our major product areas our balance sheet and cash flow provide us with more than ample capital to fuel our growth objectives
8058083 because we supply the global solar power industry with its core equipment and technology gt solar has a unique perspective on macro trends and developments given that perspective we believe that the solar power industry is continuing to make additional progress in lowering costs and bringing solar power closer to parity with more conventional energy sources we therefore remain optimistic about gt solars future and that of the industry as a whole
8058084 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
8058085 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
8058086 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
8058087 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
8058088 i have handled many investigations but i cant recall a single other investigation that turned all of our stomachs in which investigators came out of briefings with tears in their eyes
8058089 ronny and marie are involved in the murder and disappearance of rose
8058090 she did something which angered ronny and he struck her on the head
8058091 she slumped her head and ronny thought she was angry at him for hitting her he then realised that the blow had killed her and he panicked he was terrified by the prospect of facing his partner marie so he drove to the yarkon river placed the girls body in a suitcase and dumped it into the water
8058092 we have conducted an extensive search in different places including the yarkon river where for several days we applied different means to locate the body

8058095 when we go into schools and talk to young people or talk to young offenders were hearing very similar things young people feel that there is no hope and no future for them

8058099 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming lovely boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss justice has to be done in this investigation all of those involved in committing this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy should be punished
8058100 we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
8058101 i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
8058102 less than an hour later mohammed had been beaten to death there are no words that can describe the horror of what happened the attack seemed unprovoked and without reason
8058103 mohammed i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and has fallen and struck his head on the pavement we need to try to find the exact circumstances of how this came to be clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to mohammed
8058104 a lot of it is religious language and he would abbreviate common phrases with one letter so righteousness would become an r wickedness would become a w so seeing how severely he was abbreviating things was quite helpful
8058105 the interesting thing about the journal is what you get is a raw unedited version of things
8058106 when history is written it is largely based on a sanitised version shorthand is a way of storing away information
8058107 this is a warts and all portrait of what was happening on the ground its the eerie privilege of peering over the shoulder of one long dead and looking into their world it is in many ways an ordinary diary wesley was quite often depressed about things and you see him struggling in depression and you see his faults as well as his strengths and virtues
8058108 there was a suspicion of lay preaching and methodism was frowned upon by the established church
8058109 my brother and i having promised each other that we would neither of us marry or take any step towards it without the others knowledge and consent
8058110 he john is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8058111 sally is slowly recovering her strength after her miscarriage last week
8058112 how far it was occasioned by our late affliction i cannot say but my brother has cast poison into the cup of temporal blessings and destroyed as far in him lay all future usefulness to the church
8058113 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables
8058114 i have a body mass index of 28 which means im classified as slightly overweight i make no secret about the fact that i could be fitter but following fitness training with mens health last year i use a running machine and my children wear me out playing football
8058115 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight
8058116 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as im concerned thats the end of the matter
8058117 we have been monitoring traffic for a long time and trends dont just happen for no reason in the past six months congestion has eased quite significantly the credit crunch is clearly the reason for that
8058118 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at slower and more economical speeds
8058119 part of the reason for these decreases is simply that there are fewer cars on the road as the price of fuel is making it too expensive for people to drive
8058120 peoples budgets are being squeezed and what is happening is that they are changing their driving habits while they are not necessarily getting rid of their cars they arent driving as often or they are perhaps car sharing to save money
8058121 the figures show that congestion has steadily continued to ease over the past six months it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next year or so because the credit crunch looks like its going to continue
8058122 it is true that people appear to be aware of what is known as eco driving they realise that if they drive slower they will be able to make a tank of fuel go that bit further its quite sensible when you consider most people will be paying upwards of 60 for a tank of fuel
8058123 it does not surprise me in the least to hear that the price of fuel and the countrys economic situation is driving people off the road i think that what is happening is that people are continuing to make necessary journeys but they are cutting down on social driving
8058124 dissident republicans groups pose a significant threat to both the police and the general public
8058125 the secretary of state has admitted as much in the house of commons and the recent attempt to murder police officers in lisnaskea by way of a rocket propelled grenade shows that these groups are developing their capacity to inflict injury and damage on people and property
8058126 the chief constable has said that the dissident republicans will be pursued to the ends of the earth now lets see it backed up with serious and co ordinated action to take the criminals behind these groups out of circulation and put those involved behind bars were they belong
8058127 we therefore have no problem in supporting a serious and robust campaign against these dissident terrorist groups
8058128 people will be aware that the provisional ira itself started out as a splinter group and because it wasnt strangled at birth in the early 1970s it grew
8058129 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republicans
8058130 the dup will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will be meeting with the security minister to discuss the threat posed by these groups and the resourcing of policing in the areas where these groups are most active specifically in the west of the province
8058131 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming lovely boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss justice has to be done in this investigation all of those involved in committing this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy should be punished
8058132 we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here

8058134 less than an hour later mohammed had been beaten to death there are no words that can describe the horror of what happened the attack seemed unprovoked and without reason

8058136 this tour has shown all people in tv at least i hope it has that this is what is lacking nowadays
8058137 you should be able to make a joke about anybody without them taking offence thats whats wrong with comedy now it has gone too politically correct
8058138 but now you can eff and blind all you want
8058139 everything starts at the beginning it is like a circle it all comes back again eventually someone comes along and they find these things in the archive and they say this is all right this
8058140 i have done more television in the past 12 months than when i was the bbcs brightest discovery
8058141 i have done so much television it is not true i dont think any of us has ever not been in work but there is that peculiar belief that if you are not on television you must be starving
8058142 i suspect that todays breaking news that there are more people over the age of 80 than we have children hasnt filtered through to television executives who have come from media studies rather than actually doing something when i say this people say he wants his show back on but i dont because it was damn hard work
8058143 people ask me why im not on telly any more i tell them i cant do magic while im cooking or painting a house
8058144 if they are not patriotic why the hell have we got the olympics
8058145 if i dont do a joke about an indian a black fellow or a chinaman it is racist to leave them out
8058146 we are the last of the line of the vaudeville performers
8058147 there has been no variety on television for the past 10 years it has just been reality what is sad is that people have never seen a juggler or a balancing act they have never heard the street comic they might have heard the university comic but not the comic who learnt his act on the street comedy became the new rocknroll and kids decided they didnt want to laugh at what their mums and dads were laughing at
8058148 audiences have got easier than they were in the seventies or eighties there was so much competition then but everyone has not got the same taste and people have the right to like what they like
8058149 when the public dont want you the worst thing you can do is hang on it is important to get out gracefully
8058150 it is very rare for anyone to get to win a gold medal for their country athletes do it but singers dont often so it is a great honour to be doing this best of british
8058151 we have known everyone from the beginning we all came up the same way
8058152 we are working all year round but when people find out i am with brotherhood of man they say whatever happened to them
8058153 everybody ends up in our dressing room after the show it is like the green room we have so much fun
8058154 if someone had said to us when we wrote save your kisses for me that people would still be singing it in 32 years time i would have been very happy with that fans bring their kids along and i can remember when they were 10 years old with their mums and dads it is a bit frightening
8058155 mr krankie your little boys willy has fallen off and i think hes going through the menopause
8058156 come here i rang up the optician hes no good he couldnt see me he said have your eyes ever been checked i said no theyve always been this colour
8058157 ive got a beautiful house a beautiful swimming pool all in its own grounds ball ive got my own beautiful house all in its own grounds with two swimming pools one with water and one without water
8058158 it may mean more public spending but it doesnt necessarily mean a windfall tax there are other ways of being able to provide the money for this energy action
8058159 the only stick they energy firms will understand is a windfall tax i have no problem with companies making profits these are excessive profits these are immoral profits it isnt good enough and we have got to take action now
8058160 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8058161 the sale should attract enormous interest not only from within britain but also from lady pidgeons customers from around the world

8058183 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8058184 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8058185 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8058186 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8058187 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success

8058199 in kurdistan there is no freedom for journalists i have proof of that the most recent proof was soran
8058200 we dont know who killed him but we do know that the government didnt care
8058201 the recent incidents have really stripped off the veneer and revealed its not much different than other parts of iraq
8058202 in kurdistan there isnt really a political opposition so the government thinks that journalists are the opposition
8058203 the problem you know with our journalists they think they are free to say anything and do anything
8058204 a free and independent press will make an important contribution to democratic development
8058205 there are no red lines there is no censorship for any subject published in livin

8058226 the jury is still out on some of the new models because the legends have been modeling for so long and have done more in their careers that is the case with linsey dawn mckenzie and merilyn sakova linsey has been modeling longer and has done a lot more therefore merilyn has a long way to go but she is definitely on the right path shes without a doubt the closest thing to linsey but merilyn would have to do at least two or three xxx videos reinvent herself constantly and might have to reach celebrity status like linsey did
8058227 its really time to finish this show so lets start again in a parallel universe
8058228 the number of people without health insurance coverage decreased to 45 7 million people in 2007
8058229 generally what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8058230 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8058231 you have to remember that the numbers in the report are from last year this year americans have been faced with record high petrol prices and rising food prices unemployment is also up meaning fewer americans have access to employer health benefits
8058232 in 2006 the number of poor elderly people would be higher by 12 6 million people if social security payments were excluded from money income more than quadrupling the number of poor elderly

8058237 xxx ceo thomas tog goss has been one of my friends for 25 years
8058238 i was one of the first ones to teach him how to drag race
8058239 xxx racing fuel is unleaded and makes more horsepower than any unleaded or leaded fuel and it burns clean the exhaust pipe emits zero or very limited hydrocarbons and it needs 50 less oil than any other racing gasoline xxx is a first step toward taking motorsports worldwide into the green zone
8058240 i was 12 and my dad bought me a gs1100 suzuki i was about 85 pounds on that big bike and george came over and gave us advice on wheelie bar height and such as we got deeper into racing we found more inconsistency with oxygenated fuels and the inconsistency comes from the oxygenating process we also found issues with fuel systems and injectors gumming up and getting residue with leaded oxygenated fuels so what weve done is develop an oxygenated unleaded fuel that creates no residue and does not have to be drained out after you race with it we have a very high oxygen content and provide complete combustion that reduces emissions
8058241 as we dynotuned that very first day with xxx we found it to be extremely consistent
8058242 the ama dragbike real street bike i race had a brand new motor in it for the start of the year and ive run nothing but xxx in this thing
8058243 were definitely going in the right direction and have a good product
8058244 we have the problem where its almost too good to be true
8058245 its a lot of exciting things going on rather than come out as a six inch sticker sponsor on a wheelie bar i thought it would be more beneficial to have a bigger presence at the biggest race of the year and also it will be cool to be a new sponsor in the field for the ringers gloves battle
8058246 were real excited to have tog and xxx come on board
8058247 i know that their fuel works because ive been watching them come along and they really have a good product im really happy to represent them
8058248 the xxx race fuels people are all such good down to earth kind of people and im really happy to help promote their company
8058249 ill be doing everything i can to take their sticker into the indy winners circle along with all of our other great partners
8058250 there will be lots of news to follow as this product continues to develop
8058251 the whole concept is accelerating at a rapid rate i wish it was legal now for our class but were happy to help introduce it to the motorsports world at the 54th u s nationals were very very proud to help introduce this brand new company to our favorite form of motorsports nhra powerade pro stock motorcycle racing and get this product into the hands of the racers

8058260 i came across your story on the internet and offer the following only as information for future reference it is in no way meant to detract from your story
8058261 one of the customs rendered at a funeral for a former servicemember would be a rifle volley not a 21 gun salute the 2 customs are often confused and misidentified even among veterans but are distinctly different traditions with specific origins and meanings
8058262 the 21 gun salute is this nation s highest protocol gun salute and the only individuals it is rendered to are presidents heads of state and reigning royalty
8058263 specifically 21 guns cannons firing blank charges 21 times are fired in salute only in honor of a national flag as a formal greeting or farewell to a sovereign or chief of state of a foreign nation a member of a reigning royal family and the president ex president and president elect of the united states
8058264 on the other hand anyone who is entitled to a military funeral generally anyone who dies on active duty honorably discharged veterans and military retirees are entitled to 3 rifle volleys rifles firing blanks into the air in 3 separate volleys
8058265 the 3 volleys come from an old battlefield custom of a bygone era

8058267 we make no apologies for the tough action that is being taken in relation to this or any other home where potential problems with care are identified
8058268 older australians in aged care deserve good care and any home failing will be dealt with
8058269 the welfare of the residents was the governments primary concern and that is why the aged care standards and accreditation agency and department of health and ageing are monitoring the facility
8058270 acceding to the optional protocol demonstrates the rudd governments positive re engagement with the united nations after many years of inaction on a number of important international instruments
8058271 if australia is to be taken seriously when it comes to international human rights then its important that we impose on ourselves the same high standards we expect of our neighbours
8058272 the government received a high number of positive responses from womens groups and community organisations
8058273 by signing up to the optional protocol australia places itself as a global leader when it comes to womens rights

8058275 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8058276 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8058277 the privacy and spam acts provide australians with protections against receiving unsolicited emails and it is in business best interests to familiarise themselves with their obligations to ensure they are not in breach of the law
8058278 my office has found that many of the privacy complaints we have received could have been resolved successfully by the organisation or agency that was the subject of the complaint
8058279 it is to the benefit of the complainant and the organisation or agency involved for complaints to be dealt with as quickly and effectively as possible at an organisational level before my office needs to become involved
8058280 by using these new guides organisations and agencies will have a step by step checklist to work through that aims to help them develop efficient and effective processes to address complaints
8058281 these guides are part of a large range of materials my office has produced to assist the community
8058282 in fact the csa has 10 348 separated parents registered within berri and surrounding areas
8058283 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
8058284 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
8058285 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
8058286 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering

8058288 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
8058289 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
8058290 at first remote applications could send arbitrary intents meaning that your google talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did
8058291 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
8058292 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
8058293 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
8058294 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
8058295 i dont know but something caused that they only happen in accidents and when there are very extreme temperature shifts
8058296 when our neighbor drove off the snowy road and got his car stuck up against on top of my car thats what did this
8058297 in fact the csa has 7984 separated parents registered within colac and surrounding areas
8058298 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
8058299 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
8058300 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support

8058303 metal manifesto is really the simplest most direct injection of metal ive ever had the illicit pleasure to produce
8058304 metal manifesto this album is really the simplest most direct injection of metal ive ever had the illicit pleasure to produce it is worth the weight trust me its either our crowning glory or my scorched swan song no click track no kbds no autotune no gratuitous octupled guitars or vocals no cutting out all the mistakes ok i admit we did tune the guitars but that was after much gunplay its as warts n all and as in yer face as i could get it and it phreakin rocks me all that i can ask of an album is that the songs and musicians are strong that the sound is unique and most importantly that it sounds to me what my favorite album would sound like as far as reference to past pile issue musically i would think that this album sounds like it belongs smack between inquisition and ugly but done with todays gear a few of the songs battle axe and road pigs were even written back in 86 and 87 more importantly it sounds as totally different and fresh as it sounds familiarly old school and pile icious after its release on halloween the fans will no doubt let us know loud and clear what this album is and where it fits then well all know hyaaar the bottom line is im quite pleased with it it rocks my face off so the fans should like it too after all as the exalted high priest of the metal inquisition could i really do other than bang my head thrash it out and speak the words that thou wouldst not of course not that wouldnt be living to the word of my metal manifesto

8058370 to me saying all african american journalists think alike is just as insulting if not more so than saying they all look alike
8058371 john bodette and charles pittman deserve recognition because their qualities are so similar to those of bob mcgruder and because they havent lost their focus on the importance of diversity despite extraordinary economic challenges for the industry
8058372 their passion for diversity is unwavering and an inspiration to others they model what they preach by mentoring hiring and promoting journalists of color their organizations and readers reap the benefits of newsroom diversity through richer fairer more inclusive and more relevant content
8058373 has been a persistent and influential voice for diversity and industry change particularly among the people who lead newspaper companies
8058374 through actions and words he has leveraged the access that he has to industry leaders and at his company has set an example for others to follow
8058375 charles understands as so many do not that if we abandon the goals and principles of our business now were truly lost
8058376 charles stands tall for the idea that newspapers obligations to serve all parts of their community hasnt gone away just because advertising and circulation revenues are lagging
8058377 that shows that his legacy of championing diversity will extend long into the future it also shows the impact one committed editor can have on the careers of individuals
8058378 sets a tone and creates a culture that invites journalists of color to boldly display their abilities and launch their careers
8058379 he has made that a priority during his 33 year tenure first as managing editor and now as executive editor for the 45 professionals in the room the welcoming is as natural as breathing and talking thats just the way it is ask john why it is and you will eventually hear his creed do the right thing
8058380 during my five years at the st cloud times john became an invaluable coach and mentor to me always encouraging me to think big and go for the key stories even when it seemed impossible
8058381 he taught me to care about our readers be passionate about my job and look for the truth no matter how difficult it may be johns passion for journalism and his heart for young journalists have left a lasting impression
8058382 being black in america has little to do with skin color being black means that your heart your soul your mind and your body are where the dispossessed are

8058384 the protest of which we are speaking have an inevitable political character to be with the oppressed is to be against the oppressor

8058386 they have to be more entrepreneurial and more opportunistic about seeing possibilities for the industry they have to be mentally very nimble and very comfortable with constant change
8058387 from soundbites to solutions bias punditry and the press in the 2008 election
8058388 bias punditry and the press where do we go from here
8058389 the media plays an essential role in our democracy both providing information and shaping the conversation about who we are as individuals and as a nation
8058390 but this election has raised questions about how the press is fulfilling its role as the great public educator and whether more should be done to ensure that the images we see in the media are both accurate and representative
8058391 this election has presented not just a challenge but an opportunity for our country to meaningfully address the issues that have for too long kept us apart
8058392 voters candidates political parties and the media are being called upon to address the ways that race gender age and class shape our political system the mixed results weve seen throughout the primary season indicate that its time to develop solutions for better communication as we head into the general election this forum is an opportunity to do just that
8058393 at the maynard institute we believe the fault lines of race class gender generation and geography are the prisms through which we see ourselves each other and events around us
8058394 they are the most enduring forces shaping lives experiences and social tensions in this country its our responsibility as media professionals and consumers to help our fellow citizens learn to better communicate across the fault lines

8058467 and as i am a psychiatrist we are all paranoid after the war we are all traumatized we developed suspiciousness during the civil war we had blood on our hands we fought against a dictator and we killed each other so everybody is paranoid that somebody is following him and we think that if we give up the arms that other tribes will attack us let us disarm ourselves and give the arms to the government
8058468 if we give our arms to the government we will become like the ladies other tribes from the east and from the west they will attack us
8058469 we will disarm ourselves but our boys and the guns will remain together they will go into the military camp they will get to keep their guns but they will be out of the town out of the city if our tribe will be attacked from the west from the saad muse subclan or from the east and the airport our boys with the kalashnikovs they will jump over the fence and they will come to defend us dont worry
8058470 our boys will rest our boys are traumatized from what they experienced and witnessed during the civil war the life threatening they have gone through they killed some people and they lost their loved ones so they experienced and witnessed the deaths of their friends and disintegration of their families they will rest they will sleep they will have a shower they will cut their hair they will clean their teeth they will clean their clothes
8058471 they will get rid of the trauma symptoms they will become human they will marry our girls they will think about their families

8058587 let me point out that our youth centered culture is youth centered particularly in one important way education for years and centuries and millennia it has always been assumed that education is the prerogative of the very young that theres such a thing as finishing your education we teach kids that to be grown up is to be able to be stupid for the rest of your life in the 21st century were going to have to think of education not as a task to be completed but as a process to be continued i foresee a 21st century in which the educational process will be organized so that every human being has a right to institutional help for education in any field he wishes in any direction he wishes at any age he wishes education and learning will be the name of the game
8058588 tools for thought is an exercise in retrospective futurism that is i wrote it in the early 1980s attempting to look at what the mid 1990s would be like
8058589 cyberspace consists of transactions relationships and thought itself arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere but it is not where bodies live we are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race economic power military force or station of birth we are creating a world where anyone anywhere may express his or her beliefs no matter how singular without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity your legal concepts of property expression identity movement and context do not apply to us they are all based on matter and there is no matter here

8058604 the website is principally a marketing and communication channel and therefore the domain of marketeers but it is also a technical channel so technical management plays an essential role as well the sitestat watchmouse connection has made the communication between both stakeholders much more direct and easy
8058605 by measuring from different locations on the internet we can give a clear view of how the performance of a website is experienced by the visitor research has shown that visitors already leave after a waiting period of 4 seconds the nedstat and watchmouse measurements are perfectly complementary in giving insight in the relationship between performance and visitor behaviour

8058611 some could not bear even to mention it to their wives and children it was inhuman degrading and endured in private but it cut deeply into one of the most basic of all human needs the need to be wanted instead they had been rejected even the new world did not want them now they must rely again on the old the committee suffered in silence knowing it was not just an anonymous group of people who had been turned down but that they individually each one had had the open door shut in their faces through them their entire race had been judged and found wanting

8058614 we were so frightened we put the jeep in reverse and drove out backward real fast
8058615 we didnt know what was going on in there and we didnt want to end up like the people we saw the german guards had abandoned the prisoners but we didnt know that to be safe we wanted to bring more men
8058616 the people were in such bad shape i dont think they had another day left to live
8058617 looked like the walking dead they were skin and bones the people were so happy to see us they were tugging our clothes feeling our uniforms between their fingers like they were gold
8058618 remember this day passover in which you went out of eygpt out of the house of bondage it shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes that the lords law torah may be in your mouth for with a strong hand the lord has brought you out of egypt

8058631 should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8058632 for pelosis blatant misrepresentation of her own professed religion for despicable political purposes
8058633 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8058634 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8058635 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
8058636 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
8058637 doubts about the value of life and the beauty of life and even a doubt about the future
8058638 selfishness and fear are at the root of pro abortion legislation
8058639 we in the church have a great struggle to defend life life is a gift not a threat
8058640 the church says life is beautiful it is not something to doubt but it is a gift even when it is lived in difficult circumstances it is always a gift
8058641 i think i was reading romans 10 where paul speaking of the jews asks and how shall they know unless someone is sent this command to take the gospel good news to israel reminded me of the verse from isaiah chapter 40 and the music just sort of came to me from there

8058650 i cannot compare the philippine healthcare system with australias medicare there is no point of comparing ang layo talaga at ang laki ng kaibahan

8058655 up with education for all up with peace up with obama biden wake up america
8058656 and guess who voted with the bush administration 90 percent of the time john mccain
8058657 if you look past the speeches to his record one thing is clear john mccain has never believed in in renewable energy
8058658 just as i am proud of arizona i like to be positive about my fellow arizonans
8058659 so i wanted to say something positive about senator mccain
8058660 when i heard him say the economy is not an issue he understands as well as he should my problem was solved
8058661 because i can say to you tonight positively that john mccain is right he doesnt understand the economy as well as he should and he doesnt know how the policies he has supported and wants to perpetuate have so terribly misfired
8058662 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
8058663 en la educaci n de los ni os como lectores tradicionalmente se ense an h bitos de lectura asociados al silencio y al orden h bitos en los que no se ha establecido un rol importante a la m sica como un factor de desarrollo por otra parte en la educaci n escolar es habitual que el ni o reciba clases de educaci n musical que no vinculan la m sica y las destrezas que l necesita adquirir para convertirse en un buen lector sin embargo actualmente existen numerosas investigaciones que sit an a la m sica como un factor importante en el desarrollo integral del ni o en edad escolar aport ndole elementos importantes para su crecimiento intelectual f sico y psicol gico es prop sito de este trabajo de patricia castillo guerrero rescatar conceptos tiles tanto de la ense anza musical como de las teor as acerca de la lectura con el fin de promover el desarrollo de actividades de animaci n a la lectura impulsadas tambi n por las ideas de quienes insisten en la necesidad de lograr aprendizajes significativos con metodolog as no tradicionales que apuntan hacia una formaci n integral del escolar
8058664 barack obama is a charming and fine person he has a loving family
8058665 barack obama would mean that wed have less prosperity and less security
8058666 after eight years of george bush you might be surprised that a texan is president of planned parenthood
8058667 after all there arent many people eager to see the words
8058668 women deserve a president who understands their health care needs the record is clear barack obama does and john mccain does not
8058669 has voted against womens health care 125 times you can look it up he voted against real sex education against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade

8058693 hes just making a more sophisticated more interesting version of the same mistake that traditional superintendents have made
8058694 they figure that they know how to make this stuff work theyre just going to put these pieces together and if everybodyll get out of their way they can solve it fix it
8058695 a talent pipeline that can be sustained when new orleans is no longer the flavor of the month
8058696 the real opportunity of new orleans is that with all this energy and mojo and enthusiasm and talent its actually an opportunity for a superintendent to focus much more on creating an environment where you allow new schools to bring in talent and to launch schools rather than necessarily presume theyre going to be part of the system
8058697 that would either be taken as an indictment of the possibilities of urban schooling or of whats being perceived as aggressive reform
8058698 its not the reed of old its not the douglass of old its not the john mac short for john mcdonogh of old if you come to school every day and try real hard we will not let you fail you will succeed

8058738 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8058739 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8058740 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8058741 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8058742 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8058743 i want a floor that looks like that stunning modern museum we ran into when we got caught in the rain in chicago

8058745 many other acts of terror even recently that are comparable
8058746 to advance a right wing agenda on every front every uterus must be examined every tree chopped down every oil well dug i mean its absolute madness
8058747 i mean the only group of people that i know who werent weeping for the next several weeks after sept 11 were the people who were busy typing legislation into their computers
8058748 e verybody in the world knows that americans are geographically challenged and historically challenged
8058749 and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable and there are other acts of terror that have gone on in places like bosnia that we forgot to notice
8058750 i think i was on the side of justice and ultimately it will be seen that way
8058751 i dont think our move was so much towards violence
8058752 i think that what we did was to look at this situation of 2 000 people a day being murdered in vietnam and try to figure out a couple of things
8058753 and in that moment sds students for a democratic society and every other organization came unglued and people went different ways
8058754 so yeah we we found that an appalling alternative and so we set about building a clandestine organization and the whole point was to survive them and then possibly to take the fight to them against the war and against against empire generally i think we were moving in a direction that said demonstrations you know weve tried to demonstrate weve tried to petition our government weve gone door to door and knocked on doors weve talked to our neighbors weve talked to you know our parents our republican parents and everybody agrees with us but we cant stop the war so what do we do
8058755 i think that we were driven by hope and love and aspiration as much as we were driven by despair
8058756 you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
8058757 how far are you willing to take that step into what i consider the abyss of violence and we really never did except for that moment in the townhouse i actually think destroying property in the face of that kind of catastrophe is so restrained and i dont see it as a big deal i mean the catholic left when the berrigan brothers climb into nuclear silos and hammer on the warheads is that terrible terrorism and violence i dont i dont get it i dont see what the equivalency is yes theyre crossing a line yes theyre breaking the law yes theyre using weapons but theyre also not hurting anybody theyre not killing anybody meanwhile in the background 2 000 people are being lined up at a pit and shot and laughs where those things become equivalent just boggles my mind
8058758 we examine less in this country the way the ideology of anti communism wreaks the same results
8058759 y ou know its easy sitting in america with all of our wealth and privilege and layers and layers of denial its easy to say to point to all the evil out there in the world and say but were good people were good people
8058760 t he problem there is that we fail to actually look at our history and our impact on the world so if you say something if you point out whats happened in the last two weeks a reference to the abu ghraib scandal oh thats an aberration thats the face and un american i love that donald rumsfeld says its un american when this began george bush said were going to shock and awe what the hell is shock and awe its murdering innocents its humiliating people its devastating a country so were doing it now up close and personal
8058761 well hes very charming and charm does get you pretty far in american politics its kind of frightening

8059032 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8059033 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8059034 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8059035 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8059036 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8059037 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8059038 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8059039 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8059040 on the separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
8059041 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8059042 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong

8059088 they say the art markets due a correction like all the others
8059089 but it wont happen you know why india russia and china theyre pouring so much money in they buy at any price they dont care its a hyper market and theyre going crazy for it
8059090 people always like things with the real touch of the artist
8059091 they have become unique theyre not going to come up again like this
8059092 right now most markets are dropping but what happens is people sell their shares and use the cash to buy art
8059093 the people buying contemporary art now are increasingly rich indian business people
8059094 and they are buying into a western mindset and values
8059095 the real growth and switch from traditional art to modern was not until 2002 this coincided with the indian economy expanding the market in india was underpinned by the new wealthy entrepreneurs and non resident indians nris based in new york amp dubai this group of people whose wealth was based on new technology and films were drawn to new art rather than traditional art and its close association with the colonial era in china this has not been the case the contemporary art market is essentially driven by european money as all the galleries are owned by europeans and most of the clients live abroad the chinese market is therefore more volatile and regarded from an investment stand point as less mature
8059096 the rapid rise in the more established indian artists will probably plateau but there is still some growth in the new artists of today

8059231 parents need to realize that they should treat me like an adult and not keep babying me around they treat my older sister as a grown up for things they should not although she is only 2 years older than me she is given the importance and respect of being at least 5 years older than me
8059232 it should be noted that vidal is conservative in many respects
8059233 he stands behind individual choice the limitation of executive power and preservation of the environment like his grandfather he dislikes the empire he would return us if possible to the pure republicanism of early america

8059238 the decision will require us to make some extremely difficult decisions
8059239 unless life or limb is in immediate jeopardy or sexual abuse is about to occur
8059240 what we didnt need to do was raise the white flag in a memo to every cps worker to simply protect cps rather than protect children
8059241 you have to have a safe place apart from the family to successfully interview a child and find out what happened
8059242 although the changes which are necessary are substantial and call for a rapid transition this in no way lessens our commitment to do what is in the best interest of each individual child in each individual circumstance
8059243 the whole reason we started the litigation was because we felt there were wrongs in the system
8059244 a chance to stop and think whether there is something that can be done that is less traumatic to the child
8059245 in that way the government may ensure that everyones interests are considered and the least amount of harm will come to the children the government seeks to protect as well as their parents
8059246 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8059247 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8059248 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8059249 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8059250 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8059251 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8059252 john mccain offers four more years of the same bush cheney policies that have failed us
8059253 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8059254 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8059255 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8059256 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8059257 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8059258 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8059259 all my friends keep saying you should try to hook up with shawn johnson
8059260 they said youre not good enough for him and youre ugly
8059261 you can see why people want to keep things to themselves
8059262 she told me and i was like are you serious
8059263 i was like maybe it will get to the top 40 i just cant believe it
8059264 it was actually the first song that the label played for us to listen to
8059265 they played just a rough demo of it and i was just like wow
8059266 we only have a month and a half to work on it
8059267 were just looking for the best songs we can find in the shortest amount of time
8059268 i used to have days off but now when i have a day off i have to just work on the album
8059269 i dont feel overwhelmed or anything im finally living my dream
8059270 prima di guardare la pagliuzza nellocchio altrui togli la trave che offusca la tua vista
8059271 e un gioco spieg la pazzia in cui io mi copro gli occhi e mi metto a contare fino a 1 000 000 mentre voi vi nascondete e quando avr terminato di contare il primo di voi che scopro prender il mio posto per continuare il gioco

8059273 i am coming to save the world i just need to build a bigger boat
8059274 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8059275 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8059276 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8059279 i voted in my first i think it was my first year
8059280 i had not been involved in the issue i had come from being in the military to running for congress in a state that did not have a very large african american population and it had not been in issue it just simply had not been
8059281 it was not necessary to have another federal holiday that it cost too much money that other presidents were not recognized
8059282 they told us the day that martin luther king was shot they told us the day that bobby kennedy was shot but they never bothered to tell us about the moon shot so it was certainly selected news
8059283 best described as a poetry slam backed by hip hop beats and acoustic instruments the set defies any hopes at categorization food for thought and a banquet for the ears this sets atmospheres linger long after the final notes sound
8059284 12 1 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord 12 2 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven 12 3 and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth 12 4 how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
8059285 4 1 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter 4 2 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne 4 3 and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald
8059286 he kept harrassing me about i never get to spend any time with her because of you
8059287 i enjoy this i feel like proud its an honor to me to look like some smart people some great man maybe im not the right people to speak about him but thats my personal opinion and i think the future of the united states is in the obama hands

8059290 steve jobs eventually will get old i like our chances
8059291 does anybody paint anymore you cant do that everyone is doing installations now or performance or video
8059292 painting is not dead um its alive and um at least um
8059293 if some painting is still to come if painters are still to come they will not come from where we expect them to
8059294 today there is an almost uncanny resemblance between the discourses around the status of contemporary painting and rock music the techno factions in both art and music have repeatedly buried the canvas and the guitar for good and time and again both have risen from the grave claiming that their time had not yet come that there was still something substantial to say with and about them
8059295 these paintings are reconceived in terms of the larger cultural spectacle without allegory or any idea that looks backwards for its own relevance i want them to be the symbolic language object come to life the way it is impossible to ignore something that stirs in the ashes not dead but rising from the death of everything that has been poisoned and made extinct around it
8059296 yes i am the first to admit that my paintings are willful perversions of my training inversion and perversion only serve to reinscribe the law they seek to undermine it is all shit the law is there and in my last breath like all lapsed believers i will whimper and ask for forgiveness i will die groveling begging to be reinstated into the ranks i never truly left the ranks of the law abiding stupid me i was a beliver all along
8059297 beh a dire il vero il tuo cuore molto meno bello del mio
8059298 confronta il tuo cuore col mio il mio perfetto mentre il tuo un rattoppo di ferite e lacrime
8059299 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai a cambio col mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio amore ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ne ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi e cos ho qualche bitorzolo a cui sono affezionato per ciascuno mi ricorda lamore che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini a mare rischioso certo ma per quanto dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che provo anche per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo spazio che ho riservato per loro comprendi adesso che cosa sia la vera bellezza

8059314 but ignatius that was the only time you worked since you got out of college and you was only there for two weeks
8059315 all you did was paste them little slips in the books
8059316 yes but i had my own esthetic about pasting those slips on some days i could only paste in three or four slips and at the same time feel satisfied with the quality of my work the library authorities resented my integrity about the whole thing they only wanted another animal who could slop glue on their best sellers
8059317 you think maybe you could get a job there again

8059320 stunning artwork fabulous wall or floor coverings and fashion forward furniture are often the primary focus of home decorators
8059321 using window treatments in much the same way that gorgeous frames accent cherished photos or paintings can make all the difference
8059322 getting proportion right takes a good eye and a lot of experience
8059323 one size definitely does not fit all so it can pay to have treatments created specifically for the windows in your home
8059324 custom furnishings are often comparably priced to ready made and can represent great value when you factor in the time and expertise of professionals
8059325 the different elements of a room or a window should be in harmony
8059326 even a simple decorative band of trim in a pretty complementary pattern on a solid fabric panel can add visual interest to a window and tie in the other design elements of a room
8059327 when people hear the word makeover they usually think that means replacing the cabinets counter tops and appliances which can be an expensive venture not to mention inconvenient with all the stress youll soon be under why not start small with some dramatic changes that can be made by a do it yourselfer in a day or two

8059336 lately when i retired to my home determined so far as possible to bother about nothing except spending the little life i have left in rest and seclusion it seemed to me i could do my mind no greater favor than to let it entertain itself in full idleness and stay and settle in itself which i hoped it might do more easily now having become weightier and riper with time
8059337 that on the contrary like a runaway horse it gives itself a hundred times more trouble than it took for others and gives birth to so many chimeras and fantastic monsters one after another without order or purpose that in order to contemplate their ineptitude and strangeness at my pleasure i have begun to put them in writing hoping in time to make my mind ashamed of itself
8059338 to say that one has left certain intellectual habits behind is easy enough but how is it to be achieved for a rationalist this constitutes a minor daily crisis a sort of split in ones thinking which even though its object be partial a mere image has none the less great psychic repercussions
8059339 it seems like it was just yesterday that i was on the phone with howard dean saying you have to bring it to the west you have to bring it to colorado and as he worked on it very hard really for the last two and a half years it is finally here and it is 100 times more wonderful and more thrilling than i thought it would be so im very proud with what denver has done
8059340 i think new media is essentially what has energized this election in 2008 i think new media has brought about the young people of america to be so engaged and involved and educated about their choices in this election it is absolutely phenomenal and i must admit that coming from my own three statewide elections attorney general in 1998 2002 and then us senate in 2004 new media is new it was not around in my 98 or 2002 campaigns it was coming in a little bit in 2004 but from 04 to 08 it has become absolutely phenomenal so its very very important and its going to have a dramatic impact on the outcome of these elections

8059393 and when he desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men and to set the world in order he revealed observances and created laws among them he established the law of marriage made it as a fortress for well being and salvation and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down out of the heaven of sanctity in his most holy book

8059408 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8059409 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8059410 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8059411 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8059412 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8059413 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8059444 the tomato is so accommodating in flavour that it lends itself to all styles of dishes and is equally delicious in them all on the continent it is in common use but the americans appreciate it even more highly than the french and exhausting all methods of combining new culinary delicacies eat it in its raw state just gathered as a bonne bouche at an early breakfast fresh tomatoes may be cooked in a variety of ways cut in thick slices and fried in a little butter they form an excellent addition to a matutinal chop or a fresh and delicate flavour may be given to the time honoured rasher at breakfast by mashing them up with a little butter and seasoning and simmering them over the fire for a few minutes until thoroughly hot through

8059466 the spirit of the laws of the hive for in them the individual is nothing her existence conditional only and herself for one indifferent moment a winged organ of the race her whole life is an entire sacrifice to the manifold everlasting being whereof she forms part it is strange to note that it was not always so we find even to day among the melliferous hymenoptera all the stages of progressive civilisation of our own domestic bee at the bottom end of the scale we find her working alone in wretchedness often not seeing her offspring the prosopis the colletes amp c sometimes living in the midst of the limited family that she produces annually as in the case of the humblebee then she forms temporary associations the panurgi the dasypodae the hacliti amp c and at last we arrive through successive stages at the most perfect but pitiless society of our hives where the individual is entirely merged in the republic and the republic in its turn invariably sacrificed to the abstract and immortal city of the future where there is progress it is the result only of a more and more complete sacrifice of the individual to the general interest each one is compelled first of all to renounce his vices which are acts of independence among the humblebees for instance the workers do not dream of renouncing love whereas our domestic bee lives in a state of perpetual chastity little city abounding in faith and mystery and hope why do your myriad virgins consent to a task that no human slave has ever accepted another spring would be theirs another summer were they only a little less wasteful of strength a little less forgetful of self in their ardour for toil but at the magnificent moment when the flowers all cry to them they seem to be stricken with the fatal ecstasy of work and in less than five weeks they almost all will perish their wings broken their bodies shrivelled and covered with wounds

8059470 by its nature marriage can offer you the opportunity to be with someone with whom you can fall short and make spiritual advances ideally within a harmonious and unified atmosphere
8059471 one thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred cause namely the extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed by bahaullah

8059474 and while this way of thinking about marriage doesnt fit the romantic notion of marriage
8059475 it is a way that we can help change the world every day
8059476 you know we dont usually think of reading as a spiritual exercise but i think it is because in order to hear a story you have to quiet yourself and you have to empathize with the characters in the story and isnt empathy part of the spiritual life isnt quietude part of the spiriitual life

8059491 this is the first time genetic testing has been recommended for a common disease
8059492 using cascade testing we should be able to move to the point where we have identified the majority of people with fh in the long term future we will be able to find them all
8059493 they can be offered semi skimmed milk it is crucially important no children should ever start smoking if they have fh if they smoke it multiplies their risk by two and a half fold almost without exception children will require treatment with statins by 18 but very small numbers of children will need treatment earlier
8059494 my prognosis is excellent i was given the chance to control my life unlike my father
8059495 we are not just dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers the proposal to add 7 500 to these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who we expect to be kept from one another
8059496 those present were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal and believed there were other ways of deploying the huge sums of money involved that would make a far more effective contribution to the governments stated objectives
8059497 prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour they will be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained
8059498 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8059499 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8059500 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health
8059501 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings age related macular degeneration results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8059502 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8059503 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8059504 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8059505 at present we cannot detect differences in effects or risks although avastin may require fewer injections as it appears to last longer after each injection so the taxpayer may wish to question why they are paying so much more for lucentis when avastin appears to achieve the same outcome
8059506 they are an extra pair of eyes and ears and if tasked properly they will get results because unlike police officers who can get diverted they are usually on the street for seven hours engaging with the community
8059507 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8059508 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8059509 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change

8059514 an increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west africa then it is taken on by land or ship to europe across some dangerous and difficult terrain
8059515 we are forcing criminals to raise their risk factors by turning up the heat and forcing them out of their comfort zones
8059516 its too early to tell how much cocaine is arriving but it is not a small amount
8059517 corruption has always been in the back of our minds in difficult operating environments such as africa it is a challenge to find partners who we can trust but we are making headway
8059518 it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
8059519 since 2000 average street prices in the uk have fallen consistently for heroin cocaine ecstasy and cannabis
8059520 there is some evidence to suggest that a two tier market for powder cocaine has emerged in the uk during recent years at both wholesale and street levels these data suggest that there is now an expanding market for cheaper heavily adulterated cocaine among young people and students for example and that higher purity cocaine is aimed at more affluent buyers
8059521 over the past 10 years cocaine has become increasingly available in the uk while it still retains its glamour image prices have fallen and put the drug within the reach of a wide range of people for whom cocaine has become an unremarkable part of their lifestyle
8059522 it seems as if this process began with the break up of the large cocaine cartels in colombia during the early 1990s resulting in the development of several smaller cartels who needed to find new outlets beyond the traditional us market
8059523 this is the same gang there are an awful lot of connections between the two
8059524 the plane tickets were booked at the same north london travel agents and by a man using the same name and with the same credit card
8059525 this gang circles around potential couriers sizing them up these three girls could be the tip of the iceberg
8059526 although plane tickets have been bought inoculations organised and hotel accommodation in west africa arranged the three mules were only asked to return with a package because they do not explicitly mention class a drugs the authorities are finding it difficult to prove a conspiracy
8059527 they buy them things and offer them holidays hairdos clothes and nights out what girl wouldnt want that
8059528 but theres a price theres always a price to pay these people can send 10 girls out there at a cost of 20 000 if one gets through they make more than 100 000 profit
8059529 he took her to another hotel where he was staying and said to her if you want to get back to england you will be taking this weed with you and youll get 1 000 that was the only way she was going to get back he told her
8059530 we were given one minute together before the hearing separated by a perspex screen we were both crying our hearts out she kept saying im sorry dad im so sorry dad

8059532 right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract i wont play in kiev everything has happened very quickly so i couldnt even say goodbye to my team mates
8059533 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8059534 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled
8059535 there is a concrete sum which tottenham proposed and we have agreed the amount

8059538 every parent wants the most outstanding place for their child and there should be enough to go round
8059539 the proportion of daycare providers inspected with good or outstanding childcare has risen from 53 in 2005 06 to 64 in 2007 08 though the proportion of childminders judged good or outstanding has fallen from 65 to 59
8059540 parents should keep the ofsted reports in perspective its the experience of one inspector on one day and they fulfil an important function in keeping things safe but the school gate and nursery car park are the best places to find out what a nursery is like
8059541 though only a small proportion of childcare settings are inadequate that masks the fact that there are almost twice as many inadequate childminders this year providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the eyfs and provide the high quality education and care children deserve
8059542 its heartening that childcare in this country is improving but we want to drive up standards even further that is why we are introducing the eyfs in september which will give every child equal right to the best quality care and learning
8059543 bahai marriage is union and cordial affection between the two parties
8059544 my tita screeched knocking wildly on the gate i was napping and the sound of my aunts slightly hysterical voice shocked me into waking i ran to the door and yanked it open
8059545 how a disillusioned but trusting nation was deceived by a bunch of carpetbaggers
8059546 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8059547 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8059548 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8059549 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8059550 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8059551 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8059552 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8059553 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8059554 the weirder it is the more likely somebody is going to pick it up and read it
8059555 we try to think of things that are a little raunchy unorthodox
8059556 the humor is not as in your face as it used to be

8059571 awwwww oh my goodness brothers name come here they are making a rhino webkinz it is so cute
8059572 in all seriousness there were five and a half years of my life when i didnt have a home i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair so im not doing this to get a house im doing this so that the american people can have a house and can keep that house and i know how to do that
8059573 ive given a lot for my country i didnt do that because i thought it would make me rich i did it because i love my country and the people that live here theyre the ones whose interests i want to serve not my own
8059574 ive been really disappointed with our performances this season and i have told the players that
8059575 i think we need to improve in every area in the second leg
8059576 we were lucky to leave belgium with a 0 0 when you see the goal that wasnt given and the penalty it could have been worse and we were not a threat at all but the positive is that it can be a wake up call the players must understand what a massive game this is
8059577 the first thing is silverware i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing
8059578 but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money it is the same for the club
8059579 they are well organised they have good players and they have quality it will be a tough game for us because when a smaller club faces a top side they can play without pressure
8059580 that was their best game together so far the understanding between them was much better but the team didnt play well and all the attention went to carra jamie carragher and steven gerrard because of their goals
8059581 you have to put eight british players on the list and we had to decide before the first leg
8059582 so we considered who might be in the final and left javier and lucas out
8059583 well give it our best but if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8059584 all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night im pretty sure they were top with maximum points thats some poor start
8059585 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season
8059586 no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
8059587 ive made my feelings known about transfers and we need to back up the squad if we can

8059591 as we have a very obliging director in john wardle the loan was made by him and it was repaid in two days it was never needed to pay wages
8059592 maybe anton needed a new environment to get his career on to a new level
8059593 he has had a very good club in west ham dont get me wrong but sometimes when a player comes through the ranks and they have been there since they were a young kid i think sometimes they get to a bit of a crossroads they think which road am i going to go on am i going to go to another level or just stay where i am
8059594 there is no reason why he cant go on and become a top top player i think he has an international future
8059595 he has played over 150 games and were on about players with a bit of experience so for all his rawness he has a few games under his belt he knows the premiership he is english its a good price so it suits everyone it will be up to anton if he goes up to the next level he has the ability but trust me it is always up to the player how far they go
8059596 we paid good money for danny and he has done well for us he played 20 odd games in the premier league last season and scored three goals if someone tells me his value has halved in that time then he wont be going anywhere

8059618 sen obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops
8059619 when i pass my boards im going to challenge your job
8059620 i respond after all what are instincts but learnings that lead to behaviours from a long time ago that were previously found to be
8059621 there are very many who though not denying the holy scriptures do not believe in endless torments
8059622 there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
8059623 this is so ironic im giving you good for nothing junk and youre charging me money i mean i already had to pay for this stuff once ive got to pay again just to get rid of it
8059624 as a minimalist what should i do with my books
8059625 a bed requires only two sets of sheets period one to wash and one to wear
8059626 the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak
8059627 if they republicans were sincere about recruiting blacks and latinos they would have more success
8059628 we consider the values of inclusion tolerance and social justice to be fundamental to the fabric of our nation

8059634 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal stations to which the laws of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
8059635 all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8059636 we dont need more spin about how the surge is succeeding in doing what it was supposed to do which is to get the iraqis to stand up and take responsibility for their own future so we can start sending ourtroops home
8059637 i welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place although i would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in anbar province sunni tribes who started to see after the democrats were elected in 2006 you know what the americans may be leaving soon and we are going to be left very vulnerable to the shias we should start negotiating now thats how you change behavior
8059638 so i think it is fair to say that the president has simply tried to gain another six months to continue on the same course that hes been on for several years now it is a course that will not succeed
8059639 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
8059640 the problem the surge the goal of the surge was to create space for iraqs political leaders to reach an agreement to end iraqs civil war at great cost our troops have helped reduce violence in some areas of iraq but even those reductions do not get us below the unsustainable levels of violence of mid 2006 moreover iraqs political leaders have made no progress in resolving the political differences at the heart of their civil war

8059712 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8059713 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8059714 although one may be sympathetic to the tribes suspicions that powerful political forces interfered with an independent review of their tribal recognition the court must accept that the evidence presented at face value in particular the testimony of the agency decisionmakers that they were not unduly pressured by particular politicians or the political climate at large
8059715 one by one the judge has batted away the schaghticoke claims leaving no shred of legal or factual support

8059735 well in my humble opinion the phenomenon is very interesting it has some elements of a psychological nature but is also an interesting sociological and cultural epi phenomenon for those listeners who dont understand what that is let me explain
8059736 so when someone attached a moniker or name to their automobile it usually signifies one of a number of things or possibly a combination firstly it may be a way of objectifying an intimate object by naming it with a familiar name it gives the vehicle the status of a member of the family or a friend this is particularly so with elderly cars our research has shown that new cars very rarely are named until they have done many thousands of miles it might be then that the car has become a part of the family and shared a number of adventures with them it becomes familiar secondly our culture increasingly relies on machines to perform many tasks we might spend up to seventy five percent of our day only interacting with a machine thus we form an attachment to them and the best way of solidifying that attachment is to add a name thirdly it is usually women who name cars women have much stronger social bonding than males and you may have noted that when women who are strangers meet they are often talking at an intimate level very quickly this had historical anthropological meaning and this has probably hung over from earlier times when it was highly adaptive
8059737 looks like its a goner probably only get a couple of hundred for it now not much call for these pity it looked like it was a good un

8059740 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8059741 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8059742 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8059743 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8059744 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8059745 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8059746 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8059747 now i could stand up here and say lets just get everybody together lets get unified the skies will open the light will come down celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect

8059783 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
8059784 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
8059785 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations

8059894 our experience shows that unfortunately defenders of the israeli governments actions have used a charge of anti semitism as a tactic in order to smother democratic debate
8059895 personally i have very little time for the politics peddled on hp warmed over social democracy plus humanitarian imperialism plus trenchant zionism do not suit my radical palate but they have as much right to push their rubbish politics as any other blogger regardless of how distasteful they can be at times so down with the complaints the writs and the threats of court action and away with those of censorious intent if youre stupid enough to make the kind of mistake jenna delich did then you should take the blowback on the chin not scrabble around for a lawyers letter
8059896 for it would seem that people at ucu are not content merely to silence the majority of the most effective and trenchant of the anti boycotters who have been forced to respond to the vile bile which passes for solidarity in this union silenced for nothing other than trying to do something about the virulent antisemitism which has been allowed to become rife in ucu no now it would apear that ucu or at the very least people most active within it have set the net far wider still and are presently engaging in their usual threats and intimidation only this time its out there in public in full view for all to see and not merely behind closed academic doors as has happened to date in the deepest and most frightening secrecy imaginable courtesy of ucu hq apparently adamant to protect none but the racists
8059897 i would add this if you agree with what is written on a fascist website then you should stop and wonder why that might be
8059898 as far as i can see ms delich used passed on a link to david dukes site his name was in the url i am not a fan of the israel right or wrong position but if your opposition to the policies of the state of israel encompass neo nazi scumbag retards then you need to ask yourself some very hard questions about personal anti semitism even as a simple mistake it really doesnt pass muster to even bother reading those sites suggests a lack of awareness of the white supremacist movement and that really is dreadful ignorance at best at worst well that kind of opposition is worthless as it is based in prejudice principled opposition to israels policies involve in part opposition to racism and that anti racism applies just as equally to racists who hate jews but clothe it in objections to israel every person who is critical of israel has to be keenly aware that others might base that criticism in bigotry and so a due diligence is necessary to make sure those racists have absolutely no part in your politics you cant fight one kind of racism with another
8059899 when this boob was pointed out her responses have included that she didnt know who he was will she now link to one kenny smith 5 on immigration issues or is it only israel she takes the bnp line on or my favourite that because it was on google it was alright had nuremberg been an academic senate goring would have said of von rippentrop he deserved to be dismissed if only for his stupidity no heres a tip doctor delich sorry ms delich i habitually call academics doctor try googling your name in the top ten you will find six references to your disseminating nazi literature got to be true ah but fortunately the anti daddy warbucks of the ucu list lse based research fellow mike cushman came like st george to her rescue and fought the zionist worm and accepted her apology on behalf of the whole list mr cushman with study in correct web usage was able to assure the lesser mortals that web searching can be fraught with difficulties and it there is just a cigarette paper of difference between appropriate resources and promoting with government and staff funded services hate material ah bless maybe he should point her in the direction of the correct web usage guides every first year student has to pass
8059900 it is imperative that minority voices not be silenced or ignored
8059901 isnt it kind of funny that the likes of delich always ready to wank on about the power of the jews and the zionists to stifle criticsm and about the influence of jews in the formation of public opinion turn out to be able to to close down a web site that published an entirely justified critcism of delich for citing a neo nazi website

8059936 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8059937 this is a consequence of the governments obsession with policing on the cheap as well as their staggering complacency towards the extension of surveillance
8059938 it is beneficial to use accredited persons to target those community problems that are deemed unsuitable for the police because police enforcement might be seen to be excessive
8059939 this is a sinister move towards a stasi snooper state in which jobsworths are devolved the powers of the police
