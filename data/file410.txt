4100000 because when youre sitting typing at your computer unless your boss is behind you looking at your screen they dont know what youre doing whereas looking at somebody hunched over a phone its a little easier to know that theyre probably not working
4100001 most organizations have already well recognized the potential distraction of having cell phones in the workplace and are already creating policies to limit that conduct where its not business related
4100002 if an employer doesnt have a policy for cellphone use theyre very behind the times and one component of that policy is that the volume should not be a distraction to others in the workplace and that would go for the gaming applications as well
4100003 my advice to employers is to focus on results if employees are getting their jobs done and they are productive and they are working to the capacity that you believe they need to work to then you dont have a problem with what they do for five minutes here or there
4100004 so employers have to allow their staff some freedom 15 minutes a day or half an hour a day or certain times when you can have a fun break and play the iphone thats going to work a whole lot better

4100013 questi fatti recenti si scatenano contro i pi deboli ovvero il punto finale di un fenomeno che si continua a voler combattere reprimendo chi si prostituisce e i clienti piuttosto che le organizzazioni criminali che spesso ne costituiscono lelemento forte se veramente si volesse intervenire decisamente contro gli aspetti criminali della prostituzione basterebbe decidersi a regolarla facendone una professione in attesa di cio lassociazione radicale certi diritti interverra con un sostegno anche legale nei confronti di chi subisce soprusi come quelli di questi giorni

4100072 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
4100073 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
4100074 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio morgan stanleyof 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto
4100075 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
4100076 what was the state supposed to do stop people building houses that wouldnt be reasonable tell the banks who they can lend money too we couldnt do that either we warned that building 800 000 homes a year was not sustainable and that granting mortgages for 40 years was folly but there are certain things the government cannot prohibit

4100084 its coming up about three months this weekend and ive had the clearance from the specialist to get back into it so that was basically my first run with the team
4100085 i broke my radius it was a complete break and i had a rod inserted through the canal in my bone and ive actually had the same one done in the other arm
4100086 it was quite a severe break huricanes wing hosea gear was running with the ball i went to tackle him and my forearm hit his knee hes a strong boy and bringing his knees up through sprinting there was a fair bit of force behind it and i was going in quite strongly with my arm too
4100087 it was two forces colliding so someone had to come off second best and the radius isnt that big a bone
4100088 it comes with its ups and it comes with its downs and its about how you manage them at the end of the day im nearly back so the frustration has been and gone
4100089 im not a good watcher of rugby and ive tried to stay out of it as much as possible because i found myself getting frustrated
4100090 obviously i was around at the start of the campaign when we were doing our team building but once we got into the season leading up to the manawatu and otago games i pretty much kept clear and let the boys get on with their jobs
4100091 i cant really say if im able to get through training and tick all the right boxes then i could be anywhere from one to three weeks away but it all depends on how it the arm reacts to getting stuck in
4100092 i mean the wrist is still a bit weak i threw a ball about two weeks ago and it was quite painful so ive got to try and get back into that
4100093 even though i want to get back and play i cant come back too early because then i wont be doing the team justice and ill end up looking a bit of a fool

4100112 both the presidential candidates have been supportive of our bids
4100113 obama of course is from chicago and did a video for us in our domestic phase
4100114 he lives three blocks from where our olympic stadium will be he is from the same political party as our mayor who endorsed him in the presidential nomination race against hillary clinton
4100115 i think that the ioc wants to go where they are really wanted and so its very important that the head of state is there and i believe whichever candidate wins they will do that
4100116 it worked well for london tony blair did a great job and it worked well for sochi with vladimir putin

4100118 we learned from london about the stadium and like londons it will be a legacy stadium that will be reduced in size and will be used for athletics and other sporting and cultural events for that community which is predominantly an african american community
4100119 our stadium is very beautiful practical functional and relatively economical and the design is something other countries could utilize afterwards

4100146 weve set up a company called honey ryder music ltd and were selling shares in 50 per cent of the band 3 500 gets you one share which gets you half a percent of album sales touring profits merchandise in perpetuity
4100147 its a high risk project but because were an enterprise investment scheme you can get tax breaks former emi ceo eric nicoli has bought a lot of shares and is really into us but anyone can buy a share if they like the music and can spare the money
4100148 it was weird coming back but humbling everyones really excited about the music and what were doing a lot of people came down to watch us play and then had to head back to work until 9pm
4100149 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
4100150 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
4100151 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
4100152 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
4100153 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
4100154 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
4100155 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
4100156 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
4100157 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor

4100159 we have to agree on the gradual deployment of troops and police in gori but there are mutual suspicions
4100160 they suspect that the forces we are deploying are not police forces the separatists are trying to intervene and meddle in the situation it is quite tense and the ceasefire is quite fragile here
4100161 they promise to leave tomorrow we have many reaaons not to believe them but we try to help them to stick to what they have said

4100214 it found that there were a thousand times more amino acids released by chemical extraction than pyrolysis
4100215 within a month rafael told me about his puzzling result with the jarosite
4100216 navarro gonz lez and mckay think that during the heating step of the viking experiment any organics given off at moderate temperatures would have been turned into co2 before they reached the gc ms thanks to catalytic iron compounds in the martian soil
4100217 we suggest that a small portion of the carbon dioxide seen by the viking experiments could have resulted from the oxidation of organics
4100218 even if its just a small percentage this could mean levels of organics on the surface of mars a thousand times higher than expected

4100414 since camecos quarterly results vary significantly comparing todays results to our record second quarter last year is not a good indicator of future performance
4100415 we will continue to benefit from our uranium contracting strategy which will provide upside benefit from rising market prices and protection should prices fall
4100416 the metal price environment during the quarter strong production results and the volume of sales allowed us to deliver net earnings of 65 0 million or 1 10 per share for the second quarter of 2008 our ebitda of 222 6 million for the six months ended june 30 2008 is just shy of the 222 8 million ebitda generated for the entire year of 2007 with record copper production and strong gold byproduct revenue the cash cost per pound produced was 0 91 for the quarter the lowest quarterly unit cost the mine has recorded since quadra assumed ownership in 2004

4100418 other quarterly activities included the ongoing construction at carlota where its development remains on schedule with the first production of cathode copper expected in the fourth quarter at sierra gorda we made significant progress with an updated resource estimate that increased the project resource four fold we also acquired significant additional water rights elected to secure our land position by exercising our option agreements and we are currently moving forward with an aggressive 37 million development program to advance the project towards pre feasibility
4100419 an additional 15 7 interest in international molybdenum was acquired bringing the total interest in the malmbjerg project to 98 2 we continued with permitting and engineering studies but are waiting for receipt of our exploitation license at that time we will be in a position to finalise the schedule and the costs of the project and make a development decision
4100420 with cash on hand of 262 million as of june 30 2008 and no debt the companys balance sheet is robust and we are well positioned to pursue further m amp a opportunities and continue with the execution of our growth strategy

4100591 the results of the first six months of 2008 reflect significantly higher revenues compared to the first six months 2007 due to the higher average time charter equivalent rate our vessels have achieved and the higher number of vessels in our fleet
4100592 as of today about 80 of our ship capacity days in the remaining of 2008 have been fixed including the spot voyages already concluded for which the revenue is already known in 2009 34 of our capacity is under time charter contracts or protected from market fluctuations we believe that our contract coverage gives us a solid revenue base for 2008 and 2009 more predictable cash flows and sufficient downside protection while still allowing us to participate in the potential upside of the market
4100593 the university of toronto has partnered with ibm to become one of the worlds premier computational research institutions a collaboration that will attract researchers from around the world
4100594 scinet will have one of the best facilities in the world that will allow canadian physicists to participate in the adventure of the large hadron collider
4100595 this research may change our view of matter and the universe
4100596 a system this complex could only be designed by bringing together the best minds from the university of toronto and ibm
4100597 this is a tremendous example of public and private collaboration that will benefit the canadian research community for many years to come
4100598 with the support of ge energy financial services as our partner we are confident in submitting a very strong bid into the bc hydro clean power call request for proposals in november
4100599 these projects have the potential to generate enough clean energy to meet the needs of over 300 000 homes and will position plutonic and ge energy financial services as leaders in the development of clean energy and reduction in reliance on fossil fuel generated electricity by annually offsetting over 2 2 million tonnes of co2 emissions
4100600 this bid strengthens the existing relationship between plutonic and ge energy financial services and if successful would significantly expand ges renewable energy base in the province of british columbia

4100617 knowledge proven dedication to historic sites and enthusiasm will be outstanding contributions to the success of woodlawn and the pope leighey house as we move forward with plans for restoration and new initiatives
4100618 even as barack obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections they said president clintons 1993 deficit reduction plan would wreck the economy eight years and 23 million new jobs later the economy proved them wrong now they are making the same claims about sen obamas tax plan which has even lower taxes than prevailed in the 1990s including lower taxes on middle class families lower taxes for capital gains and lower taxes for dividends
4100619 sovereign wealth funds are a hot topic but theyre poorly understood
4100620 with both elements of price and wage rigidities inflation creates distortions due to wage and price dispersions and due to its effects on monopolistic mark ups by price and wage setters the choice of the optimal inflation rate balances these distortions at the margin the paper first characterizes these tradeoffs in the steady state version of the model and finds that for a wide range of parameter values the optimal rate of inflation is negative when the monetary policy is committed to adjust nominal interest rates to ensure its objective of price stability it might target a deflation rate this is due to the fact that the mean of inflation is affected by shocks and on average this mean is approaching zero the welfare analysis then reveals that real growth decreases the welfare cost of inflation

4100627 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4100628 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4100629 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4100630 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4100631 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4100632 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4100633 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4100634 my father was a colleague of known muslim league leaders like fazlul haq and husyn shaheed suhrawardy when they visited rajshahi they used to stay at our residence so i grew up in a dense political environment
4100635 my father could never have agreed to send me there
4100636 there was freedom and a lot of work to do transport was cheap there was a tram service and there were friendly people all around i cannot recall a single calcutta street lane or by lane where i did not leave my footprints
4100637 calcutta and assam which we had always considered a part of the eastern wing of our new country pakistan went to india
4100638 there was a feeling that we had been robbed of a part of our victory but not the entire victory we had achieved something too
4100639 but the secession of bangladesh in 1971 was a full blown shock in which we lost everything
4100640 i spent three years at the parliament trying to tell the rulers they should not spend all the east pakistani money for development in west pakistan i tried to warn them that there was already smoke in east pakistan and there would soon be fire
4100641 the first thing i noticed here was that men looked at women with lust something i had never experienced in bengal and then there was bonded labour due to the domination of feudal lords

4100647 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4100648 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4100649 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4100650 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4100651 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4100654 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4100662 this marks the very first public appearance of dragon age origins ever with fans able to get a first hand look at some of the exciting combat devastating magic and credible digital actors that make up this epic adventure
4100663 revealing new details about combat exploration dialogue the games origin stories and a few other juicy surprises not to be missed
4100664 mandrake have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water
4100665 what weve got here is probably one of the largest if not the largest stone built
4100666 at some stage in the sites life it wasnt domestic at all
4100667 the sheer scale of these structures suggest its something way beyond that
4100668 only half of this structure has been revealed in this trench as the other half disappears under the house of lochview as indicated by the geophysical surveys
4100669 however in this half we can already make out a sub rectangular building with rounded corners over 11 metres wide internally surrounded by a massive wall over two metres thick the scale of this structure is even larger than the monumental
4100670 if structure ten was roofed it would have have been truly incredible monumental in every sense of the word an astonishing sight and something that most neolithic people would have been in awe off
4100671 just having the one structure like structure ten on a site would be amazing
4100672 but weve got more one or two which are bigger than those at barnhouse our structure eight for example features these beautifully constructed regular stone piers creating a building over seven metres wide internally
4100673 at the end of the day weve got several large buildings which appear to be contemporary youre looking at a complex of large buildings which highlight the importance and significance of this site
4100674 whereas excavation at other settlement sites has tended to produce a limited range of pottery here from the quantity of different pottery uncovered might suggest it was brought in from a wide range of sites
4100675 from simple incised decoration to pecking and more substantial carved motifs for obvious reasons we cant say for sure what these represent whether purely decoration ritually symbolic or perhaps just somebody making their mark on a structure
4100676 it would indicate that all the structures here were special something more than domestic houses when it comes to the artwork i suspect were looking at something which again truly emphasises the importance of this site
4100677 the weight of these sad times we must obey to speak what we feel and not what we ought to say
4100678 since i am not running for an office here and have no reason to state this politically or politely i am going to call this exactly what it is my brothers gentlemen it is hypocrisy
4100679 brothers let me reiterate unless there would be any lack of clarity and let me muster as much boldness and passion as i possibly can to say it one more time gentlemen it is hypocrisy
4100680 when i look into the eyes of my sisters how can i not speak
4100681 if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am but a clanging cymbal
4100682 those offices are on the front lines they know who is making the loans and who isnt
4100683 ideally you should locate failed businesses and inventory liquidators in your local area

4100685 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god

4100714 i am changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood
4100715 i wouldnt change my past because it has groomed me to be the man i am today growing up has nothing to do with age people grow up mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop it is almost impossible to get past the stereo type it associates you with i will always love hip hop it plays a major role in who i am today i have branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all of that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry
4100716 its important for young hip hop artists to know that they are not limited to one career they can educate themselves and prepare for life after hip hop the same way pro athletes prepare themselves for life after sports
4100717 also know that you can branch out into other avenues if you are multi talented or have other dreams my dream was to enter corporate america my sons dream is to go to college and play basketball and will smiths was to be a famous actor many of us can begin new careers take advantage of different opportunities and still remain true to hip hop
4100718 there are a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the businessman
4100719 my goal is to educate the hip hop culture now and if they dont get it then hopefully their kids will get it and understand my fellow hip hop artists should know that we cant rap forever im glad im in a position in my life where i dont have to put out music because ive prepared myself for the future to build the generational wealth we have to educate our families thats why my son is going to college fifteen years later im still successful because ive realized the importance of education growing up and responsibility
4100720 i only did this for the kids to show them somebody had to do this everybody else is afraid

4100869 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place

4100919 houghton is getting whatever hes asking for so he is doing well sukhwinder also did well for india if we get all the facilities even we can produce the desired results but we should have patience with the indian coaches what happens is that allegations fly thick and fast after a poor performance

4100986 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4100987 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4100988 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4100989 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4100990 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4100991 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4100992 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4100993 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
4100994 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4100995 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4100996 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
4100997 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4100998 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4100999 only served to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4101000 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4101001 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4101002 we would like to underline that the representatives of international and humanitarian organisations have not been granted an access in the territories controlled by the russian armed forces
4101003 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4101004 only western peacekeepers can end the war i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4101005 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st century system of security
4101006 neighbors are getting farther and farther apart all the time
4101007 when the state starts purchasing land it takes away some of the fabric of the rural community
4101008 both leaders have agreed to resume the work of the joint committee for demarcating the syrian lebanese borders in accordance with a mechanism and priorities both parties would agree on in order to serve the target aspired
4101009 there are certain procedures that we should follow next thursday the lebanese cabinet will sit and take a decision that will establish the diplomatic ties a week later we will take the necessary steps with the syrian foreign ministry that will allow us to carry out what we agreed upon
4101010 both leaders have also agreed to reactivate the work of the joint committee in charge of the missing people from both sides
4101011 the issue of the missing people is thorny and complicated communal tombs may need to open the most important thing is that we should solve this topic away from politicization
4101012 weve done a lot of changes to the car to try and get traction and to try and make the car faster
4101013 we will have to see if it works and if we are fast enough
4101014 theres definitely more to do more work to come in areas the team has taken the dampers in house which shows there is an issue but as i say were working on it we need consistency from the car for the whole rally
4101015 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4101016 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4101017 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend
4101018 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4101019 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4101020 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4101021 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4101022 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4101023 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4101024 he was an admirable arkansan and gave so much to this state and his party

4101084 all of a sudden i saw the truck hit everything just went everywhere
4101085 the front of the truck flew up into the air then i saw the carriage of the train coming past opened up like a tin

4101098 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
4101099 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
4101100 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
4101101 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
4101102 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
4101103 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place

4101107 with more cars on our roads increasing levels of congestion and rising emissions it is time for us all to look at our travel behaviour
4101108 we need to look at new ways of persuading people out of their cars and onto more sustainable forms of travel such as trains buses walking and cycling
4101109 the proposals from local authorities and regional transport partnerships have been impressive and the seven communities selected now have the chance to improve travel options for thousands of residents
4101110 initiatives like the bike rental schemes the development of park and choose sites more pedestrian only areas and free trial bus and train tickets will help us to meet our ambitious climate change target to reduce scottish emissions by 80 per cent by 2050
4101111 these proposals will help to promote healthier travel choices too providing more opportunities for cycling and walking allowing more people to enjoy the benefits of increased physical activity
4101112 these schemes will make a real difference making transport choices cheaper healthier safer and greener
4101113 we look forward to the lessons learned from this project being used as a template for other local authorities showcasing the very best of sustainable travel initiatives it could result in a catalyst for change right across scotland
4101114 cosla is happy to be involved in this project it helps both councils and the scottish government to meet a number of aspirations we share with the scottish people we have far too many short journeys being undertaken nearly three in five car journeys are for trips of less than three miles
4101115 where councils are involved in this initiative local people will be able to see the advantages of intensive sustainable travel initiatives
4101116 one of the less direct but equally important benefits of this project is that it will provide information and experience useful to other councils in preparing similar schemes over the coming years this project will allow participating local authorities to address these issues with a significant amount of resource and support
4101117 i recognise the importance of rural supports role in providing assistance to farmers and farm families suffering stress associated with farming they understand the issues that affect the farming and rural community most and work with the farmer and the farm family to help them deal with stress an accelerated rate of change within the agriculture sector risk of animal disease and financial pressures are challenges that face farming families these combined with difficulties caused by regulations and legislation and changing social environments including family breakdowns and isolation among older people can all contribute to increased levels of stress i would urge farmers and farm families who are anxious or feeling stressed to contact rural support as soon as possible so that support can be put in place to help alleviate worries and anxieties
4101118 i want to take this opportunity to thank rural support for all their work in the last few years and commend the contribution made by the charitys team of volunteers
4101119 this funding will allow rural support to continue developing our outreach work and support farmers and rural families who are feeling worried or stressed it secures our position for the next year and we look forward to strengthening our relationship with dard and other key statutory community and voluntary organisations with a role in rural areas in helping to build a strong base for our ongoing work
4101120 despite the fact that twitter is in english we continue to see exciting growth from all over the
4101121 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4101122 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4101123 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4101124 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4101130 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4101131 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4101132 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4101133 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it

4101136 ordinary in terms of time and place taking into consideration that al zawahiri delivers monthly addresses
4101137 determination to deliver an address at this time in particular refutes rumors about his death in the most recent raid on the pakistani afghan border that targeted abu khabab
4101138 the timing of message is consistent with his media appearance tactics
4101139 al zawahiri appears almost once every month and in the past year he appeared about 10 times nevertheless the rumors that have been circulated by the american cbs news network about him being wounded or killed give his recent message special importance
4101140 this falls within the framework of the media diversification strategy which al zawahiri constantly seeks to pursue
4101141 this message is a way for al qaeda to prove itself following the painful blows it has been dealt including the death of abu khabab

4101152 there are many ways to be free one of them is to transcend reality by imagination as i try to do

4101305 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4101306 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4101307 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class

4101313 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4101314 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4101315 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4101335 inevitably when you spend a year as mayor away from the cut and thrust of local politics it takes a little while to re adjust to the role of a ward councillor

4101634 the hawk can be used to provide basic advanced and weapons training in its operational role it can be used as a ground attack fighter as it is capable of carrying and delivering munitions it also has air defence capabilities when armed with air to air missiles
4101635 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4101636 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
4101637 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4101638 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
4101639 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family
4101640 for years all my hens were infertile but today theyre finally fertile
4101641 the leaders of the party have chosen to groom mark warner for national prominence
4101642 warner is more valuable in delivering virginia at this point than tim kaine
4101643 his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country
4101644 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
4101645 showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia and the results we achieved in our effort to help people compete in a changing economy
4101646 this will be a great opportunity for the country to see governor warner and virginia on the national stage
4101647 america needs more common sense leaders like mark warner and barack obama who are willing to roll up their sleeves and work across the aisle to get things done
4101648 they only put people they respect in that high profile position like obama four years ago
4101649 it puts to rest the false claim that he is bipartisan what will he say to 20 000 liberal democrats that will sound bipartisan to the working people of virginia

4101653 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4101654 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4101655 they are the eyes and the ears of our communities
4101656 a lot of kids are scared of law enforcement we want to bridge that relationship so these kids can feel like they can come talk to us
4101657 its one of the best programs that parks and recreation has
4101658 its one of the most highly attended programs we offer its a really good program with a really good idea behind it
4101659 were learning what can happen in real life and how one thing can lead to the other
4101660 things can be bad and we dont want to do bad
4101661 the gold medal is what we came to get to go back with a bronze is good but its not what i came to get

4101666 we are really going after a man on the street grassroots feel with this
4101667 its a combination of questions of whats on peoples minds and the issues they are confronting in their own lives
4101668 why has the dysfunctional government failed to extend the tax incentive for the solar and wind industry
4101669 how many people out there have said i cant do this because im gay then they wake up and see the third openly gay member of congress may be seated in november
4101670 we are reaching that point where among democratic voters sexual orientation of a candidate is not a factor
4101671 what we had was some press issues and those issues that were highlighted in the press came home to roost
4101672 a lot of it was people saying were tired of bruce
4101673 now there will only be two parties represented in the colorado state house republicans and democrats
4101674 we dont want to give people intent on being disruptive the opportunity to be disruptive
4101675 they tried to keep it quiet until they got caught
4101676 it was always known there would be a need for increased capacity and after those decisions were made there would be a community outreach component
4101677 we dont anticipate widespread arrests but the city has an obligation to plan for that possibility
4101678 in that planning weve taken into account the concerns of the aclu and the groups they represent
4101679 detainees will have everything at this facility that they would have at the jail
4101680 colorado law requires that confidential attorney visits be accommodated at the temporary detention facility as well
4101681 i kept waiting for those internet numbers to come up
4101682 i must have hit the refresh button until i wore it out
4101683 you guys love to get predictions but really thats not my major concern
4101684 its more about accuracy than it is about speed for me speed is not the primary concern if ballots are counted slow people might be a little irritated but if theyre counted inaccurately theyll be very irritated
4101685 we have to look at that for the general election
4101686 the outcome for those presidential candidates in the state of colorado will come down to precinct by precinct voting and were going to need to know where people have voted and where they havent voted yet
4101687 if its a two pager youve doubled your processing time
4101688 its a balancing act we could spend 8 to 10 million on new machines and have quicker results because we wouldnt have to tabulate at the end of the night but is it worth it to spend 8 to 10 million to get something two to three hours faster in our judgment it wasnt worth the expense

4101693 youd be better off making your point if we were partners with large isps but we dont have any major isps using us

4101698 we are closely examining initiative 100 as we stated before it passed the city attorneys office has concerns about its constitutionality
4101699 given those concerns we will carefully analyze the initiative over the next several days and advise city officials regarding implementation and enforcement
4101700 i think there will be legal challenges it was ambiguous and very poorly articulated
4101701 the global market is becoming increasingly competitive and the states hpc high performing computing assets can help differentiate new york firms from the rest of the world by increasing the speed in which they can innovate
4101702 a decision has been taken to appoint a retired high court judge to conduct a judicial inquiry into wednesdays clash between farmers and the police in greater noida
4101703 besides the ex gratia payment of rs 200 000 that had already been awarded by the greater noida authority the chief minister has decided to give an additional compensation of rs 300 000 to the family of each of the deceased he said
4101704 the rate at which the final compensation was paid to the farmers towards their acquired land was more than double of what was originally agreed upon between the greater noida authority and the farmers pandey pointed out

4101706 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4101707 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4101708 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4101709 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4101710 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4101711 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4101712 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4101713 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4101714 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4101715 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4101716 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4101717 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4101718 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4101719 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4101720 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4101721 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4101722 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4101723 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4101724 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4101725 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4101726 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4101727 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4101728 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4101729 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4101730 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4101731 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4101732 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4101733 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4101734 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4101735 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4101736 whether a company is sourcing for stainless steel wire rope networking cables coated electrical wire harnesses or virtually any other kind of wiring or cabling product theyll find what they need in one of the wire and cable directories

4101739 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
4101740 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound

4101744 what we are hoping to do is really to not just encourage our local businesses to undertake cdm project but also to attract international companies to set up shop here for their carbon trading operations and also to encourage companies to identify cdm projects in the region so that we can build up a carbon trading hub in singapore
4101745 sectors that we see we can be doing good business with singapore are financial services it based industry and services and logistics
4101746 you need to understand the regulatory requirement to run the business so what we want to do is with this platform well be able to package these services not just by sbf but together with local authorities
4101747 many will probably say one year down the road weve not seen much given the backdrop of the rising cost of living to a certain extent the measures that are in place cpf life the various options that we have the irs integrated resorts and so forth are more long term projects
4101748 are we using the help that government has given us properly have we made use of it for the best of our family so that we are able to keep some for rainy days before we ask for more because i think we will continue to say its not enough
4101749 in singapore having a kid is an extremely expensive affair its not just dishing out a couple of hundreds here hundreds there and giving you tax rebates its a much more wholesome phenomenon i think theres a need for a more holistic approach
4101750 at times when the economy looks bad everybody will be extremely cautious people put off marriages people will put off having kids people put off buying homes people put off holidays
4101751 its a spiral and this is the problem we are facing today
4101752 una vez la polic a tuvo conocimiento aplicamos el plan candado en esa regi n del departamento y seguimos alerta a cualquier novedad

4101756 ive played all over the place in the last four years and its not really that different wherever you play the skill sets pretty much the same
4101757 its just the opposition that changes and i happen to be marking the fastest rugby player on the planet so it is going to be a big challenge but im looking forward to that
4101758 obviously they the springboks wings are quick habanas one of the quickest men around so when you are playing someone like him its just being a bit smarter and being ahead of wherever hes going
4101759 pace is a real advantage and he will be looking to use it so i need to use my brains and the pace ive got to shut him down
4101760 no one really takes too much notice of speed times its funny because some guys who are lightning quick between the lights at training when they get on the field they arent quite so quick
4101761 its more about what they call game speed your balance being able to beat a man at pace that sort of stuff so we arent worrying about them having more pace out wide than us
4101762 the sheer number of people that turned out it was just crazy
4101763 the queue for autographs literally stretched out the door of the shopping mall and there were people waiting as far as the eye could see
4101764 whilst we usually do not offer such properties as hotels having recently signed an agreement with a leading real estate agency in bulgaria they showed us this hotel that was for sale and we just believe it would make a great investment for any potential investor looking at eastern europe or even for any of our clients that are looking for a change in career and a well run well situated and hugely popular hotel might could be an option

4101777 nein einen geldstrafenkatalog gibt es bei uns nicht stattdessen ein ernstes wort vom trainer sollte einer fter zu sp t kommen muss er es mit mir ausfechten ich wei nicht ob er viel spa dabei hat
4101778 nein nein wir haben in jedem mannschaftsteil spieler die akzente setzen k nnen mit lukas podolski und miro klose zwei st rmer der extraklasse einen muss ich vielleicht auf die bank setzen wenn luca toni wieder fit ist
4101779 das eine ist f r ergebnisse zu sorgen das tagesgesch ft da hat kalle recht das andere diese ein zwei jahre beziehen sich auf die entwicklung von spielern wie z b toni kroos
4101780 es ist sch n dass ottmar f r seine leistung gew rdigt wird ich wei dass mit jeder ver nderung immer eine gewisse skepsis verbunden ist jeder fragt sich auch bei uns klappt das was wenn nicht wenn du was neues anpackst musst du es mit ergebnissen belegen
4101781 die quoten war noch viel viel negativer als ich die nationalelf bernommen habe mir macht das nichts ich werde beweisen dass bayern und ich zusammenpassen dass wir erfolg haben werden davon bin ich zu 100 prozent berzeugt
4101782 da mischt sich keiner beim anderen ein er macht das was er f r richtig h lt und wird von mir keine kommentare bekommen umgekehrt genauso
4101783 ich habe mir nicht vorstellen k nnen dass sie so kontrovers diskutiert werden die buddhas sind doch nur teil der dekoration wenn sie einen spieler st ren w rden k nnten wir sie sofort runternehmen
4101784 i have stated time after time after time that roe v wade was a bad decision
4101785 the final decision would be made by meghan with our advice and counsel
4101786 i dont think it is the pro choice position to say that my daughter and my wife and i will discuss something that is a family matter that we have to decide

4101796 having spent several years trying to identify and serve the particular needs of the imaging industry we have become extremely familiar with the importance of specialized tools and were positive that customers of vertus and imagenomic will be very pleased with the pairings of these different programs they will have access to multiple powerful applications at a significant discount

4101853 a factor which contributes to the brahmans unique ability to withstand temperature extremes is a short thick glossy hair coat which reflects much of the suns rays allowing them to graze in midday sun without suffer ing in severe winters brahmans grow a protective covering of long coarse hair beneath which a dense downy fur like undercoat can be found an abundance of loose skin characteristic of the breed also aids in its ability to withstand warm weather by increasing the body surface area exposed to cooling in cold weather the skin is contracted increasing the thickness of the hide and density of the hair which aids in retaining body heat a special feature of the brahman breed is their ability over other breeds to sweat freely which contributes greatly to their heat tolerance

4101866 if that means something needs to change with regards to the tssa we will look at all that
4101867 its time for the government to acknowledge that this experimentation this flirtation with privatization has been a failure

4101895 orang ini telah lancang duduk di atas singasana yang mulia
4101896 saya hanya mencoba coba saja yang mulia untuk merasakan betapa nikmatnya singasana itu tetapi saya yang hanya duduk sebentar saja mendapat hukuman yang begini beratnya para pengawal baginda memukuli saya hingga babak belur hanya karena saya duduk disana beberapa detik saja lalu bagaimana dengan baginda yang telah duduk disana setiap hari berbulan bulan dan bertahun tahun hukuman macam apa yang harusnya baginda terima

4101899 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4101900 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4101901 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4101902 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4101903 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4101904 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4101905 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4101906 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4101907 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4101908 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4101909 durch einbindung einer mbg beteiligung verbessert sich die finanzierungs und risikostruktur so dass viele vorhaben dadurch erst m glich werden
4101910 das zeigt dass gerade die finanzierungsvorhaben der kleinen und mittleren unternehmen in baden w rttemberg durch die mbg mit beteiligungskapital unterst tzt werden
4101911 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4101912 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4101918 die repr sentative umfrage des instituts der deutschen wirtschaft k ln iw im auftrag der vbw unter ber 700 personalverantwortlichen bayerischer unternehmen hat best tigt wovor wir vor inkrafttreten des agg immer gewarnt haben das agg ist ein kostentreiber ein b rokratietreiber und hat bei den unternehmen zu erheblicher rechtsunsicherheit gef hrt das sind die fakten in bayern und diese gelten unabh ngig davon was von anderer seite behauptet wird
4101919 ein unternehmen mit 100 besch ftigten das das agg vollst ndig umgesetzt hat hat daf r im schnitt rund 24 400 euro aufgewendet ein unternehmen mit 1 000 besch ftigten sogar 241 000 euro das sind erhebliche belastungen die die wettbewerbsf higkeit beeintr chtigen
4101920 unsere umfrage hat auch ergeben dass in 42 5 prozent der unternehmen die unsicherheit in personalfragen zugenommen hat unternehmen mit mehr als 50 besch ftigten gaben sogar zu rund 70 prozent an dass die rechtsunsicherheit gr er geworden sei
4101921 die vbw tritt zusammen mit ihren mitgliedern gegen jede art von diskriminierungen ein ich halte es aber f r verfehlt den kampf gegen diskriminierungen durch neue gesetzliche vorschriften zu f hren solche regelungen helfen den betroffenen in der regel nicht erschweren aber die abwicklung von rechtsgesch ften
4101922 auch 26 millionen euro sind keine peanuts jeder euro den wir f r zus tzliche sinnlose b rokratie ausgeben ist ein euro zuviel

4101928 durch die b ndelung der jeweiligen st rken und fachlichen kompetenzen haben wir gemeinsam ein praxisnahes studienprogramm geschaffen von dem nicht nur die studenten direkt sondern mittelfristig auch die unternehmen profitieren
4101929 denn ber die absolventen werden die technologien modelle und konzepte die wir entwickeln systematisch und nachhaltig in die unternehmen transportiert
4101930 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4101955 there is no constitutional role for the prime minister to reprimand individual members of parliament who are accountable to their electorate for their own comments the government is committed to strong equality legislation in northern ireland and citizens in northern ireland are protected against discrimination on grounds of race religious belief or political opinion gender sexual orientation age or because of a disability if anyone in northern ireland believes that they have been discriminated against on any of these grounds they may be able to bring a complaint to a tribunal or to a county court

4102236 nbc needs to capture every second of every competition at multiple venues in china quickly turning them into dynamic programming for television and internet broadcasting nothing can fall through the cracks
4102237 we welcomed the opportunity to work with omneon to support nbc for its olympics coverage omneon is the market leader for developing storage solutions for broadcast video which is becoming more prevalent via the web especially for hugely popular sporting events like the olympics
4102238 for the first time the average american will be able to create their own unique olympic experience whether at home at the office or on the go
4102239 with 25 sports streamed live at nbcolympics com and significant live coverage on our cable platforms and nbc highlighted by all swimming finals the biggest nights of gymnastics and beach volleyball live in primetime the viewer has plenty of options for live coverage in the 41 years since my first olympics its staggering to me to be involved in a games where we are producing 2 900 hours of live coverage especially from an olympics half a world away its more live coverage from a single olympics than the total of all previous summer olympics combined the enormity of what were doing just blows me away
4102240 because the workflow must be seamless and the nature of the programming is so significant we decided to use seagates enterprise hard drives which are the best fit for our needs in terms of reliability best in class design and unrivaled performance

4102267 it was clear from my visit to affected areas in the constituency yesterday wednesday that the amount of water and the damage that ensued had taken most people by surprise the work of the emergency services and residents alike must be commended for their swift action and the following clear up
4102268 it is also apparent that there is a need for a full review of north east fifes flood plans we must identify where flood prevention needs bolstering and how residents can be protected in the future
4102269 the priority is to ensure that all residents affected have any damage to their homes fixed as a mater of urgency it is imperative that all agencies are doing everything they possibly can to help those affected
4102270 by all accounts the emergency services did a very good job during this flooding but it is clear that a full review of flood plans needs to be carried out
4102271 the areas where flooding has occurred up and down the constituency needs to be identified and evaluated in order to ascertain what more can be done to minimise future disruption and damage

4102301 since the spectrum pricing formula is auctioned to which the ministry of finance is fully agreed and the process in which the ministry of finance is fully involved we are consistent with the decision of the cabinet
4102302 it is therefore surprising that the ministry of finance has now decided to express its reservations on procedural aspects
4102303 as we promised 3g auction will take place within the scheduled time there will not be any deviation fro m the announced guidelines

4102313 until now many people found it complex to download music legally and ended up frustrated when they discovered their music was locked onto a single device or was impossible to transfer to the player of their choice
4102314 but from today bigponds new service means consumers can transfer tracks from their computer to almost any device they care to use we are confident the popularity of the mp3 format our australian first agreement with all the top music labels and the power of the bigpond brand will mean customers will be clicking and downloading from us because we are the only place in australia to offer legal downloads in mp3 format from all the major labels
4102315 we welcome the launch of bigpond musics mp3 download store

4102322 the cbcps opinion even in the past is to have a constitutional convention whose members are elected by the people secondly should there be a charter change then it should be done after 2010 the new administration should handle it
4102323 if there is no consultation no communal discernment before acting the problem will get worse there is also the possibility that the solution is the wrong solution
4102324 this covert accord has been uncovered more so the certain provisions that are not only untenable but also unbelievable if the philippine constitution would not be changed
4102325 but more than just accommodating the said secretive consensus there is something much more deviate and sinister in the cha cha charter change about which malaca ang has been long since salivating in other words any constitutional change done in any way and anyhow before may 2010 is primarily geared at extending the reign of the present national leadership
4102326 may be a way to keep president arroyo in power beyond 2010 because once you begin changing the constitution anything can happen
4102327 the need for consensus is as important as for the grp it is wisdom to consult ask questions and secure assistance regarding directions and goals from stakeholders for the government consult with the different branches of government and with the people directly affected by conflict

4102367 we all find success when we realize our own dreams
4102368 carriers are already conducting trials because they want to deploy 100g systems as soon as possible and we are feeling that pressure
4102369 choosing a modulation scheme is just the beginning of this project
4102370 we need to define a whole architecture for a 100g photonics module so decisions have to be made about issues such as where to draw interface lines between parts of these modules
4102371 companies will bring 100g products to market soon they will be big clunky and have relatively high power dissipation but they will work
4102372 component vendors can see their way to take all the modulators for a 100g transmitter or receiver and put them on one chip
4102373 whats needed is investment from the component industry in integrated photonics
4102374 long haul dense wavelength division multiplexing has been stalled at 40 gbits sec for some time now even as carriers have pushed hard for an upgrade to 100 gbits sec
4102375 the oifs decision brings a common approach to modulation methods and it will also help lower the cost of transceiver components
4102376 we are creating an implementation that lets vendors pack 40 to 80 channels of 100g signals into a single fibre
4102377 that could expand the amount of capacity on a single fibre from 1 2 tbits second today to as much as 8 tbits s
4102378 we are completely complementary with the ieee effort and depend on them to create a standard for signals we can capture and modulate
4102379 we have selected an implementation approach supported by a critical mass of photonic component vendors and users
4102380 network element vendors have already begun work on products that will accelerate the adoption of 100g in long distance optical transmission

4102415 a 16th place time in 2008 would have been on the medal podium in 2004 i have friends in track and field and they ask whats up with all the world records i think its because track is a lot more advanced in its evolution than swimming but phelps is pushing everyone else to new heights

4102418 while georgian ground forces have been pushed around by the recent russian invasion georgian air defenses have been noticeably more effective the russians have admitted to losing four aircraft three su 25 ground attack bombers and a tu 22 bomber flying a reconnaissance mission most or all appear to have been brought down by the sa 11 bukm1 surface to air missile systems obtained from ukraine georgia claims to have downed ten russian aircraft as of august 11th and the true air losses wont be known until photos appear of all the aircraft wreckage it is interesting that russia was unable to come up with effective countermeasures against missile systems they had designed the russians knew of ukrainian arms exports to georgia and the presence of the sa 11s and sa 15s this is another mystery that will only be explained over time

4102438 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4102439 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4102440 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4102441 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4102442 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4102443 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4102444 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4102445 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4102446 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

4102448 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4102449 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4102450 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4102451 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4102466 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa

4102477 the best reason to choose wabash is the colleges emphasis on the individual if there is something that isnt available to me in the core curriculum i have opportunities to expand on them in other ways through college its a hands on approach that allows undergrads to do work that is normally reserved for graduate students

4102648 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4102649 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4102650 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4102651 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4102652 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4102653 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4102654 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4102655 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4102656 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4102657 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4102658 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place

4102778 both leaders have also agreed to reactivate the work of the joint committee in charge of the missing people from both sides
4102779 the issue of the missing people is thorny and complicated communal tombs may need to open the most important thing is that we should solve this topic away from politicization

4102810 yes but not very often youre not the type to do a lot of projecting because youre willing to look deeply at things youll think about a relationship or whatever for years and years willing to see it from all angles in fact you strive to do this and once youve exhausted the thing you typically come to a conclusion about what happened and invariably its fair in my mind you are not only fair youre generous youre very forgiving of other peoples foibles you know how you are you give enormous benefit of the doubt people are in good shape when theyre dealing with you you find reasons to explain their behavior that actually favor them and its rare i dont know that i have ever seen anyone do this as well as you you set the example of how this is done
4102811 i know and youre successful so if you do project something its fleeting it gets projected for a day or two you may go a week if youre extremely mixed up but generally youre going to be on top it especially if someone says something if someone like me says there is something going on youll look at it exhaustively to see if there is merit where as most people immediately move to defend themselves oh hell no thats not me
4102812 yeah but you do this for everyone not just me its in your character to be benevolent you always take the time to get to the bottom of something and this is why when you say something people have to listen its because whatever you say has been thought through you have thought about it deeply and consequently when you come up with something to say about something it has punch its very different from someone who is puking up what their neighbor told them the week before there is nothing like drawing your own conclusions that are rooted somewhere deep you can always tell you know
4102813 but yeah you dont project much and when you do its not for long i think you and i have learned this we dont like being blindsided so we use our minds wed rather discover things for ourselves and its always none of your business what the other person is doing anyway its their soul your soul is your problem
4102814 okay well thats what i am talking about when i say projecting your shadow i am talking about those people who never do anything wrong but they can tell you all kinds of the ways you suck what you did wrong or what you should be doing or maybe they see a small spot or blemish on themselves but that is also because of you whatever they did is justified because of what you did you know their pinkie may be dirty but you well youre the devil incarnate

4102832 reading in paris about kashmiri muslims rioting because of land transferred to the shri amarnathji shrine board sasb and the peoples democratic party pulling out of the jammu and kashmir government coalition one feels a little bit surprised
4102833 millions of devotees have flocked to amarnath over the centuries and muslims from kashmir should show them generosity because in india although muslims have been a minority since the beginning hindus have always respected the religion of islam
4102834 furthermore indian muslims returning from the gulf have built in the last 20 years tens of thousands of mosques thanks to the gulf money often with land donated by the indian government and without the hindus ever protesting
4102835 kashmir is also the land of sufism where the best of islam and vedanta blended which allowed many generations of kashmiri hindus and muslims to worship together in mosques and temples and attend each others festivals unfortunately after the creation of pakistan a hard sunni fundamentalism has entered the valley mainly with pakistan and afghan jihadis and four lakh kashmiri hindus have been forced by death terror and violence to flee the valley of their ancestors one of the biggest ethnic cleansings in human history
4102836 goi provides air fare subsidy to about 140 000 haj pilgrims annually the cost of it runs close to rs 400 crores annually subsidy runs to about rs 35 000 per pilgrim goi allows every muslim to transport 10 liters of holy zam zam water free of cost there is a separate haj cell in the ministry of external affairs haj committee of india has its own premises in mumbai similarly such committees in each state have their own premises on land and building provided by governments states in india have waqf boards in fact kashmir has a ministry dedicated to muslim affairs almost all of the activities and programs of the indian ambassador in riyadh and consul general in jeddah are haj related despite india proclaiming to be secular all muslims are appointed to these posts accommodations in mecca and medina are provided and they are fitted with lifts phones running water electricity and computers in last years haj a contingent of 115 doctors including 63 specialists 141 nurses 3 coordinators 46 haj officers 165 haj assistants and 186 khadimul hajaj were sent from india facilities provided by the govt include polio meningitis and influenza vaccinations 75 bed hospital and 12 dispensaries another 15 bed hospital and 6 dispensaries in medina 3 medical teams at jeddah airport 17 ambulances in mecca and medina all medical instruments treatments doctors services and medicines are free at delhi air port a special terminal is set up for easy and quick transit of the pilgrims
4102837 perhaps our outrageously petty minded and self righteous muslim leaders of kashmir will tell us what the only muslim majority state in india does in return for the hindu pilgrims in kashmir

4102845 kui eelmise aasta augustis inimene arvas et ta v ib kohe peale keskkooli l petamist juhiks minna palju palka n uda et mul on sellised teadmised siis enam mitte noored on muutunud teadlikumaks reaalsest olukorrast ning kandideerivad rohkem ametitele teenindussektoris teenindussektor on olnud alati v ga muutlik
4102846 2007 aastal oli aga i kvartalis keskmine kandidaatide arv 5 6 ning ii kvartalis 4 6 seega t us on olnud le kahe korra
4102847 k ige v hem aktiivsed valdkonnad olid meil teises kvartalis loodusteadused p llumajandus energeetika loodusvarad haridus teadus kultuur kunst rekreatsioon avalik ja riigihaldus
4102848 ega neil valikut ole palgad on ikkagi head ja minnakse
4102849 paljud noored kandideerivad hoolimata omandatud haridusest v i erialast v lismaale teenindus v i m gisektorisse
4102850 endiselt on keeruline leida head spetsialisti eriti t stuses ja tootmises its ei ole samuti m rgata n udluse langust
4102851 meie hinnangul t otsijate aktiivsus kasvab mitmel p hjusel nagu koondamised ettev tete ning t de reorganiseerimised ja palkade k lmutamised v ivad sageneda juhtumid mil m giinimesed ei leia enam t andjaga sama keelt kuna nende t tasu s ltub otseselt l bim gist mis aga tugevalt kahaneb seoses makromajanduslike muutustega samal ajal t andjad ei ole valmis v ikese v i olematu tulemuse eest senist palgataset paremate aegade ootuses s ilitama

4102876 studies of mouse skin cancer have contributed little to our understanding of human skin cancer
4102877 when it comes to skin cancer mice are not reliable models for extrapolating what happens in human skin
4102878 if the theory that applying moisturisers increased the risk of non melanoma skin cancers were correct you would expect to see more of these cancers in women and on their faces
4102879 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so

4102892 our approach is a simulation in which the starting point is the physics of muscle and tendon movement
4102893 the parameters to control the deformation of the skin arent biomechanical its just cosmetic
4102894 the network of muscles and tendons in the hand is very complicated

4102914 my concern is my son we lived in escobares our entire life and he wanted his dad to be buried here in this community i come here everyday i cant drive yet to i come walking this is where my grandma is buried so i thought id come visit my dad but the guy wont sell us anything i think its cause my dad was born in mexico
4102915 i just want an explanation from the person who runs this place hes roquer rosales

4102919 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4102920 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4102921 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4102922 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4102923 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4102924 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4102925 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4102926 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4102927 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4102928 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4102929 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4102930 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4102931 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4102932 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4102933 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed

4102936 weve got a lot less money than a lot of the teams in this league but weve got the selling point of our fans
4102937 they turn up in big numbers and that has helped us amass a decent squad which will cause a few surprises
4102938 i believe well be up there with a good chance of winning the league as we have the players to compete at this level

4102951 the mongol hui tibetan miao li and gaoli peoples can voluntarily decide whether to break away from the soviet federation to set up independent regions
4102952 it is necessary not to stress the right of national self determination for ethnic minorities during the civil war to win over minority nationalities to oppose the kmts reactionary rule our party stressed the slogan this was absolutely right
4102953 every communist must grasp the truth political power grows out of the barrel of a gun our principle is that the party commands the gun and the gun must never be allowed to command the party yet having guns we can create party organizations as witness the powerful party organizations which the eighth route army has created in northern china we can also create cadres create schools create culture create mass movements everything in yenan has been created by having guns all things grow out of the barrel of a gun
4102954 i would like to note that the air regiment that you sent to china was very helpful let me thank you comrade stalin for the help and ask you to allow it to stay a little longer so it could help transport provisions to liu bochengs troops currently preparing for an attack on tibet
4102955 its good that you are preparing the attack the tibetans need to be subdued

4102961 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4102962 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4102963 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
4102964 i must be able to do then what i can do now if everyones satisfied okay but if you are confronted with injuries and you miss long periods then you look at it differently
4102965 when things went so well in the group phase i was told by the guys that i should reconsider my decision that i should go on
4102966 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost
4102967 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4102968 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4102969 we did not have abou diaby cesc fabregas tomas rosicky samir nasri kolo toure eduardo da silva and philippe senderos while alex song is at the olympics
4102970 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4102971 im not into the theory of us just going an enjoying the day
4102972 the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4102973 the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal

4102983 weve only got two reserve team games in a month if they can play conference south or below it would help
4102984 if they played four or five games it would help them it would also help to balance the finances
4102985 we are an easter people and alleluia is our song
4102986 democracy and change can be scary but they are scariest to those in power who derive their power from suppressing change by any means necessary
4102987 to believe that a commission would adopt a plan that would end democratic majorities necessarily demands that you also believe that three out of five democratic members would be gop moles or such morons that they wouldnt understand what was happening
4102988 what weve got to find out is whether in fact it was a safe workplace
4102989 thats one of the issues that we need to find out
4102990 weve been to the afl players association weve asked them to go check the ground and at this stage we dont have a final result on that
4102991 if its found that its not a safe workplace then i would think thats probably going to be a thing that well follow up

4103039 everything speaks to the lack of desire of official tbilisi and washington to settle the conflict otherwise why did us military planes transport 800 as published georgian servicemen with military hardware from iraq to georgia
4103040 we know that saakashvili has not distinguished himself recently by the appropriateness of his analysis and actions and we would not like to think that he was given some order from washington we would like to hope that possibly we were talking about some sort of incorrect interpretation on the part of the president of georgia of any signals that could have been sent from washington
4103041 recall its own actions in various countries of the world and not engage in propaganda for the sake of one of the presidential candidates
4103042 decided to conquer the world in a consistent way economically informationally ideologically and through military operations most often by others hands the us made georgia into a nuisance state for russia
4103043 saakashvili is not an independent figure and this aggression was done in order to tie russias hands reduce the effectiveness of her policies and generally undermine the strengthening of russia which has occurred in recent years
4103044 for the first time the united states decided on a direct military probe of the russian soft underbelly in the caucasus

4103056 quando ho aperto il blog la precariet non era cos dilagante come oggi e io mi confrontavo con persone che avevano un lavoro stabile e mi davano dei consigli ora il mio blog diventato un punto di riferimento per tanti precari come me ci diamo una pacca sulla spalla a vicenda
4103057 mi piace provocare ho messo online anche il mio numero di telefono specificando che non si tratta di una linea erotica molti mi chiamano e devo dire che la quantit di maniaci prima era pi alta
4103058 ho avuto il primo contratto a tempo determinato nel 2003 sono passati cinque anni da allora ma lindeterminato ancora un miraggio
4103059 a desacelera o da economia global evidente o que n o se sabe ainda qual ser o seu tamanho
4103060 certo que o consumo de petr leo de soja de milho e de a o tende a diminuir daqui por diante mas os pre os das commodities n o est o caindo somente por causa disso houve muita especula o nos mercados que levou os pre os a patamares inaceit veis o que estamos vendo agora um corre o dos exageros que levar a economia mundial a uma acomoda o n o a uma recess o
4103061 a supervaloriza o provocou uma onda de infla o no planeta para conter esse processo os principais bancos centrais do mundo tiveram de aumentar os juros prejudicando o crescimento de economias j debilitadas agora com as commodities em queda a infla o tende a recuar e os juros parar o de subir podendo at cair
4103062 por isso estamos mantendo a previs o de mais uma alta de 0 75 ponto percentual em setembro
4103063 portanto o tombo das commodities n o pode ser t o grande se isso acontecer teremos uma crise porque os pa ses emergentes como o brasil que dependem desses produtos e t m sido importantes para o crescimento mundial sofrer o pesadamente
4103064 pris en compte le travail que le club a r alis avant et pendant le match afin de pr venir tous les incidents dans le cadre dun match dont le club n tait pas lorganisateur
4103065 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
4103066 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
4103067 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
4103068 the nra is wrong to suggest we are misleading anybody
4103069 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4103070 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4103071 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4103072 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4103073 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4103074 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4103075 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4103076 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4103077 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4103078 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4103079 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4103080 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4103081 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4103082 i have had contacts with representatives of those two clubs roma and spurs they asked monaco about my situation and about the chance of transferring me so there is a possibility that an official offer could be made in the coming days i always played very well against sevilla and i created some goals this should have left juande ramos with a good impression and now my name is on their list of signings
4103083 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4103084 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4103085 has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that might have related to
4103086 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4103087 yak n zamanda marseille ya gelin almaya gidecez biz de i te
4103088 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4103089 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4103090 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4103091 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4103092 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4103093 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4103094 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4103095 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
4103096 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
4103097 the world is whizzing around her and shes cool as a cucumber saying jack just started can i call you back
4103098 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4103099 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4103100 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4103101 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4103102 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4103103 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4103104 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4103105 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4103106 the big sort why the clustering of like minded america is tearing us apart
4103107 we are growing more isolated in our communities because we are living more and more only with people we agree with and we are growing more isolated in our political debates because we look at the television news and we read the websites of people who confirm what we think already this is not good in a democracy
4103108 every speech should contain a line saying that you were born in the middle of america to a middle class family in the middle of the last century
4103109 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
4103110 because i knew if they had those it would be harder to go back
4103111 you will regret the day you have given up control
4103112 ma mere nencouragerait jamais une enfant de 14 ans alt rer son corps
4103113 hey you there you dont know the rules of tennis do you
4103114 it is impossible that the minister was in such a state
4103115 michel daerden really has a drinking problem everyone knows it
4103116 incidents dans le cadre dun match dont le club n tait pas lorganisateur vous tes vraiment quune vraie bande de charlot
4103117 la competitivit delle aziende non importa che siano piccole medie o grandi indissolubilmente legata a un modo nuovo di gestire i flussi dellinformazione allottimizzazione delle risorse alla riduzione dei tempi vince sul mercato chi percepisce prima degli altri le mutazioni in corso
4103118 we had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay
4103119 he has been at the club for four or five weeks now and he said he would so he now becomes our record signing
4103120 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4103121 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4103122 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4103123 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4103124 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4103125 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4103126 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4103127 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4103128 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4103129 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4103130 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4103131 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4103132 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4103133 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4103134 i only know of people who have spoken about their problems getting pregnant after they succeeded thats great but i felt that people who are struggling with this need to hear from someone going through it just like they are
4103135 during the last olympics i was acutely aware that i had accomplished comparatively zilch in my life and yet was older than nearly all the athletes so the games made for kind of sucky viewing thankfully ive gotten past that stage and now just lust after the young male athletes especially the swimmers
4103136 it actually felt pretty great today because i got some house cleaning done to the tune of the olympics on tv it was pretty inspirational i think i turned in at least a silver medal performance but it doesnt feel great day in and day out
4103137 plans constantly change and theres so many variables at stake
4103138 this does a very good job at cutting through the price variable price isnt the only factor but its an important one
4103139 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4103140 we hebben een nieuw trainingscentrum een eis van de coach
4103141 het voelt als thuis aan dat is goed want onze coach wil dat we acht uur per dag op de club vertoeven
4103142 de gsm mogen we niet gebruiken maar er zijn nieuwe telefoons ge nstalleerd
4103143 klinsmann wil met drie centrale verdedigers spelen dat komt mij goed uit want zo is er minder concurrentie
4103144 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4103145 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services
4103146 to advance the education of the public in the appreciation of trees and their amenity value and in furtherance of this the planting and protection of trees everywhere and in particular inner city areas
4103147 a pretty good indication that multistate commercial traffic and regional vacation travel are down
4103148 the effects of that may be digging deeper in rural areas
4103149 consumer sentiment and the drop in discretionary spending are affecting us like they are affecting everyone
4103150 the consumer is hypersensitive about price shopping because thats the only way he can exercise control
4103151 a majority of our system is in the metro area and most of our travel is from commuters so the traffic level is very stable
4103152 if i could have gotten a bus ticket that was even cheaper but the buses were all full
4103153 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4103154 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4103155 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4103156 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4103157 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4103158 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
4103159 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
4103160 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
4103161 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to

4103167 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4103168 if the idea of an african nick drake or cat stevens appeals then daby is your man
4103169 i get up in the morning i pick up my guitar and i start working i dont know where im going to go
4103170 he needs the practice before he goes back to hong kong
4103171 so i talked him into riding for me and who knows we might fluke a winner
4103172 its been very windy and it might even get up to good for saturday
4103173 i am going into the race enthusiastic about my chances
4103174 fitness wise light fantastic is in a zone where he can run well and not get hurt
4103175 i want to see him run well have every chance and then move on
4103176 i am thinking that it is a little bit of a disadvantage but certainly he is fit enough to run
4103177 if he runs well and gets beaten i will be happy and if he runs well and wins i will be even happier
4103178 it would good if was like the 1986 cox plate with bonecrusher and our waverley star i just need to be bonecrusher
4103179 i have got to see what he does on race day in australia under weight for age conditions but he will run a cheeky race and i reckon he will be in the prizemoney
4103180 he had a foot abscess a couple of weeks ago but hes had a good preparation overall i am pretty happy with him
4103181 the rails is probably the worst draw for him because he tends to miss the kick
4103182 you dont have much time going from the winter to the spring and hes only been in work six weeks and hasnt had a barrier trial
4103183 im not sure what caused his mouth abscess but i couldnt do anything with him for a week
4103184 he won it as a maiden but hes had no luck in his races and he should have won three of his four races
4103185 he ran ninth in the champagne classic but he was caught on the fence and was only beaten a few lengths by court and should have won that day
4103186 craig newitt rode him for the first time and missed the kick and he only went around at three quarter pace
4103187 his next run was in the sires when he was runner up to fravashi but he was a run short for the race after what happened in courts race
4103188 hell have a couple of runs here and if his form is good enough hell go to melbourne for the caulfield guineas
4103189 i want to feel my way with him first as the wheels could fall off straight away
4103190 they just like adding up and playing with numbers it was not down to any pressure from their parents
4103191 ive been into it since the age of two when my grandfather bought me my first computer and at the moment i am in the process of setting up an online blog for my family
4103192 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning
4103193 sitting down and having a chat about our results and the different futures it means for all of us
4103194 and im going to make sure whoevers made the decision whoevers behind it is going to be accountable one way or the other
4103195 there is a very serious concern that this horse could have a relapse of this disease
4103196 this disease has already seen two people hospitalised and in a very serious condition
4103197 i think most people in the industry understand while its very sad protecting the industry does involve these sorts of very difficult decisions
4103198 these people were innocently doing something with the horse and became critically ill as a result of it
4103199 so from that point of view i have to support the unfortunate course of action that has to be taken
4103200 he is a big strong colt now and a ball of muscle
4103201 they are at the top of the weights and probably stand out over the rest
4103202 i dont think he was 100 per cent in the blue diamond but it should be a good contest between the two of them on saturday
4103203 he had a little break during the worst part of winter but we have got him going again

4103215 es una pena porque como todo el mundo vio jefferson estaba en muy buen momento pero conf o en la fuerza del resto del equipo para superarlo
4103216 no he hablado con bojan he preguntado a su entrenador y con el director deportivo durante el partido hablamos de estos asuntos
4103217 lo que ocurri en el pasado fue un asunto privado que lo resolvieron en aquel momento los que dirig an a la selecci n luis aragon s el primero ahora es una nueva etapa y creemos conveniente traer a bojan como un jugador que es muy bueno y al que vamos a apoyar

4103223 tenemos unos principios de f tbol que no var an mucho respecto al anterior seleccionador habr cosas distintas pero en lo sustancial creo que no hay cosas bien hechas hemos analizado todo lo que ha ocurrido en este tiempo y despu s de ese an lisis nos hemos dado cuenta de que las cosas funcionan hay automatismos creados cuanto menos lo toquemos mejor y si podeos acrecentar el potencial del equipo ser a n mejor
4103224 esp ritu con el que se gan la eurocopa y la unidad de grupo

4103343 the lord works in our lives in amazing ways sometimes ways that we dont understand when your father was younger he cheated on your mother this had to be just after you were born he wasnt in a good place then he cheated on her and thats how justin got here but they stayed together they almost didnt you know it was an ongoing affair and he just told her one day its over i cant do this to my wife anymore i have to go home and face what ive done he took himself straight home and sat renee down and told her what he had been doing he used to think he was all that mr hot shot lawyer that he was invincible he came home that night and renee listened to everything he had to say he explained what he had done when and why renee left him that night you know she packed you up and took you to my house probably because her mother was too far of a drive and wed always been close with each other the next day your father got rid of everything he sold his sports car and he came to her a changed man the lord changed him matthew he had always been a christian but after he sold his sports car he went to the church he talked to the pastor for a good three hours and he spent the rest of the day in prayer he came to your mother the next day with an apology and a promise he promised her that if she forgave him he would never take her for granted again that he would love her everyday that he would work hard for their marriage and that he would keep god number one in his life renee went back to him
4103344 matthew the lord is with us always even when we think we are too good for him or we can handle it on our own you know we cant handle anything on our own we cant even handle walking down the stairs on our own we just dont know it or admit it it is the tough times that we realize how much we need him matthew but god doesnt mind he doesnt care when you come to him as long as you stay with him your father came strong in his faith during a tough time and he stayed strong in his faith the rest of his life we can rejoice because we know where he is he is right now immediately with god sitting at his feet you know he did live a good life and he left two wonderful boys the most important thing in his life he always said was that he left you two with a strong faith in god he said if he accomplished nothing else his whole life but to give you a strong faith in god that would be more than enough he would have lived the best life he could imagine
4103345 matthew i think its time for you to get back to baseball
4103346 im not hitting anything coach i wanna go home i just dont think this was a good idea
4103347 matt in a game you dont throw your bat and walk home just because you missed a pitch you dont stop the game even if you miss
4103348 im sorry amy i dont think he will take the phone he hasnt even been eating and he hasnt left that room for two months
4103349 i know i have been so worried i tried to come over the other day you mom let me in but he wouldnt see me he wont even talk to me im so worried matt
4103350 i know ill try to talk to him again later but i dont know what i can really do
4103351 justin your girlfriend keeps calling shes worried about you everyone is worried about you you need to come out of your room why dont you come to this bible study group i went to the people are really nice and i think it would be good
4103352 matt you think you have all this figured out you think youre so cool you think youre god is so nice you think he loves you you think he even exists there is no god matthew there is no god he doesnt love you he doesnt even exist why would he give me my father and then take him away
4103353 wow dad wrote letters to mom every day that he was gone for business
4103354 renee ive been thinking about what i want for our son and i know two things i want for him in general for him to be strong loving individual who does what he loves and for him to love the lord but specifically what i would like for him to do ahh renee i would love for him to take piano lessons and to play baseball darling that would be the best i always wanted a son who played piano for music is to the soul what paint is to the painter and i also wanted a strong physical boy who could play baseball
4103355 mom dad wrote you letters every day he was gone didnt he
4103356 he did he always wrote me sometimes i wouldnt even get the letters until he was home but he wrote me every day you know samuel johnson said that a mans letters tell his soul he was right you know i loved your fathers letters so much sometimes i hoped he would go on business just so that he would send me another
4103357 so what made you want to take piano lessons you seemed pretty anxious when you called me
4103358 if god is so loving why do bad things happen to good people why does he take away our loved ones why do people die and leave us
4103359 this earth is just a temporary place who knows if it will go on forever but our time here is temporary the pain and the sadness the trials and temptations they are passing they are temporary god is forever and once we serve our time here on this earth if we live our lives for him then we go and we have this amazing eternity without all the temporary things of this world people die and it hurts us but we should realize that their time of suffering and pain is over but we still hurt we definitely still hurt we are human we are still here and we miss them because we love them love is godly god is love god is the creator of love we love truly and when we love truly we miss and we hurt but that love is what brings us closer to god we cannot love unless we love god first because he made all things things hurt because there is sin but there is sin because there is free will without free will we couldnt choose god without that choice we would be trapped we choose what we do with our lives we choose who we love and we choose where we spend eternity buried in the dirt or praising god in paradise pain is part of life but how we handle it is our choice

4103374 this upa government which has come into existence primarily on the claim to safeguard the secular foundations of india has failed so far to douse these flames
4103375 india cannot afford to allow this situation which has serious implications for our territorial sovereignty as well as social harmony to slide into disastrous anarchy
4103376 clear that the communal forces and the separatist forces feed and strengthen each other
4103377 a solution does not seem to be the objective of the rss bjp they appear bent upon to intensify communal polarisation and enlarge the confrontation to the national level
4103378 these communal forces are admirably aided and abetted by the separatist extremist forces in the kashmir valley

4103383 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services
4103384 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
4103385 i hope to stay on top for a while everything that goes up has to come down but i can still try to maintain the top position
4103386 i will take a break and find the energy and motivation to do it again

4103390 winning and losing is all part of the game there is not much of a difference 10 meter air rifle is a slippery sport with competition and i am very happy that have been able to produce result on the given day
4103391 everyone who is there has put in his best effort a really honest effort so whoever is there has the realistic chance of winning a medal
4103392 this being my third olympics experience was also a big factor since i knew what an competition was all about the journey has definitely been a long one and it is a fact that i tried everything possible experimented liberally that really helped when it mattered most
4103393 there is nothing more i could have done in terms of training competition and mind set and i was really prepared
4103394 is a possibility and they should bring many more laurels to the country
4103395 there are untested forces like the dmdk of film actor vijayakanth the party has taken note of the aiadmk leaders readiness for an alliance with the left and the dmk leaders call that secular forces should come together is also in mind

4103404 i truly believe that women hold the key to the economic power of our future and so this project is to gather more data to establish that view it has been an interesting process to discover the impact that women with small micro enterprises are having on their community and even their nation
4103405 this research will be a vital tool than can enable governments to understand the value of their female population and the impact they are already having and act accordingly to support them it should also inspire not just women but men as well to consider starting their own businesses and follow the path that many have chosen and continue to navigate successfully

4103433 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments

4103472 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools

4103479 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions

4103537 the probabilistic theory of information retrieval involves the construction of mathematical models based on statistical assumptions of various sorts one of the hazards inherent in this kind of theory construction is that the assumptions laid down may be inconsistent with the data to which they are applied another hazard is that the stated assumptions may not be the real assumptions on which the derived modelling equations or resulting experiments are actually based both kinds of error have been made repeatedly in research on probabilistic information retrieval one consequence of these lapses is that the statistical character of certain probabilistic ir models including the so called binary independence model has been seriously misapprehended
4103538 since one can derive all possible assertions from an inconsistent theory such a theory must be meaningless entirely lacking in significance or predictive power it makes no sense that good experimental results could come out of an inconsistent theory
4103539 it is tempting to explain this conundrum by suggesting that the inconsistencies in question were only minor ones however there is no such thing as a theory that is just a little bit inconsistent a theory cannot be just a little bit inconsistent any more than the scientist proposing it can be just a little bit pregnant a logical inconsistency if its implications are followed out destroys a theory utterly it is a disaster and is totally unacceptable if rationality is to be preserved inconsistencies simply cannot be tolerated

4103569 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4103570 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4103571 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
4103572 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder

4103592 in the beginning quake live will be completely ad supported its not out of the question that eventually well have some kind of a premium service
4103593 but we dont know what its going to be yet and were certainly going out with the completely free to play model as the community grows and we start seeing what people actually want to get out of it we may offer some other things there
4103594 there could be a huge possible range of successes that we could see on here
4103595 and if quake live does well we could end up keeping people on here indefinitely growing the community polishing things up adding new content as long as it can be supportable like that
4103596 if quake live is successful weve tossed around the idea of taking the wolfenstein enemy territory game which was actually always more popular than q3a in the online space and doing a similar treatment to it with the experience weve gained here
4103597 we know whether quake live was a brilliant idea or if it was dumb move
4103598 theres no way we could justify building a modern game for the pc exclusively
4103599 not to say that its impossible but it just wouldnt be a good bet even a big budget extravaganza like crysis didnt do very well in the larger scheme of things
4103600 so if you want to develop something on the pc right now
4103601 it had better either be cross platform like what were doing with rage or itd have to be something like spore or the sims 3 that really caters to the type of game that more people are playing on the pc

4103614 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
4103615 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
4103616 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
4103617 the truth is that only recently have we had this kind of 3d power where were able to create a real starcraft experience in 3d what we want to see are hundreds of vehicles and creatures clashing on the battlefield with dynamic lighting and shadows and all of these dazzling special effects thats the kind of gaming experience that our players expect from us

4103874 technology has also made it easier for employees to work remotely when traveling for business
4103875 for professionals whose jobs require a great deal of face time with colleagues or customers working remotely might not be practical
4103876 the most important thing that dtc advertising does is drive people to their doctors office to talk about a condition
4103877 dtc advertising of prescription medicines can benefit the public health by increasing awareness about diseases educating patients about treatment options motivating patients to contact their physicians and engage in a dialogue about health concerns increasing the likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care for conditions that are frequently under diagnosed and under treated and encouraging compliance with prescription drug treatment regimens

4103894 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
4103895 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
4103896 the deleterious effect of video games gets more press coverage than beer so it makes sense to me also most parents havent played gta but most have had a beer so they are less concerned about the devil they know than about the devil they dont know
4103897 sounds like a lot of parents believing what theyre told by the media about these games rather than having a look for themselves and realizing the sex and violence elements are blown out of all proportion
4103898 we specifically chose the game because it has emerged over the history of games as the most controversial of games out there it is a game clearly marked mature but there are still parents out there who dont understand that and their kids are playing it
4103899 its been interesting the conversation that the press release has sparked its certainly one of the intentions for us we want to create dialog amongst parents we certainly didnt set out to be hyperbolic about it we just simply wanted to report some of the findings we had in our community
4103900 instead of asking the question in the most basic terms we put a little bit of twist to it we asked our question in a more interesting way in the case of the second poll it was done the same way

4103925 a new study suggests that a surprising number of overweight people about half have normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels while an equally startling number of trim people suffer from some of the ills associated with obesity the first national estimate of its kind bolsters the argument that you can be hefty but still healthy or at least healthier than has been believed in the study about 51 per cent of overweight adults or roughly 36 million people nationwide had mostly normal levels of blood pressure cholesterol blood fats called triglycerides and blood sugar almost one third of obese adults or nearly 20 million people also were in this healthy range meaning that none or only one of those measures was abnormal yet about a fourth of adults in the recommended weight range had unhealthy levels of at least two of these measures that means some 16 million of them are at risk for heart problems

4104068 you have seized company property without any cause or court order to date the company firmly demands the return of the firearm in question
4104069 therefore please return the property of the company the firearm in question immediately
4104070 the materials batfe added converted the firearm submitted by historic arms llc into a machine gun therefore the materials constitute a machine gun receiver a machine gun or a conversion device
4104071 i have not heard from you or the atf since our last communication your letter of july 22 2008 informs the company that you were going to proceed with forfeiture proceedings the company asked that you proceed without delay
4104072 the company has not received any notice of proceedings you have seized company property without any cause or court order to date the company firmly demands the return of the firearm in question the company also firmly stands by its finding that the atf applied testing methods are invalid therefore ftb classification is also found to be invalid and not supported by documents issued by atf or basic common sense
4104073 even your own staff documents the fact that a notice of manufacture atf form 2 was filed by the company there was no attempt to defraud or avoid paying tax therefore please return the property of the company the firearm in question immediately
4104074 if the criteria ftb applied to the testing of our latest submission was applied to testing the many caliber conversion uppers that are sold at retail with no restrictions such as the 22 long rifle mac upper made by flemming 1 all of them would fire in fully automatic mode until the ammunition supply was exhausted 2 there would be no way for the shooter to stop fire
4104075 what the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives has done in the olofson case has set a precedent that could make any of the millions of americans that own semi automatic firearms suddenly the owner of an unregistered machine gun at the moment the gun malfunctions
4104076 it didnt matter the rifle in question had not been intentionally modified for select fire or that it did not have an m16 bolt carrier that it did not show any signs of machining or drilling or that that model had even been recalled a few years back
4104077 it didnt matter the government had repeatedly failed to replicate automatic fire until they replaced the ammunition with a softer primer type it didnt even matter that the prosecution admitted it was not important to prove the gun would do it again if the test were conducted today
4104078 what mattered was the governments position that none of the above was relevant because t heres no indication it makes any difference under the statute if you pull the trigger once and it fires more than one round no matter what the cause its a machine gun

4104089 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4104090 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4104091 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4104136 its been overplayed in a sense i think it has served to confuse the consumer into believing there is somehow now a way to misdirect them to a wrong site
4104137 the fact of the matter is that there have been many ways like phishing attacks to misdirect them for a long time and this is just yet another of those ways that will be surgically exploited

4104140 the biggest gap in security rests between the keyboard and the back of the chair
4104141 the look and feel of a website is not what a consumer should trust they should trust the security behind that website and do simple things like use more secure passwords and change their password regularly
4104142 we have been trained since we were young to lock the door to our house our car we take these sensible security measures in the environment we are functioning in

4104183 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4104184 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4104185 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4104186 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4104187 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

4104189 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4104190 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4104191 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4104192 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4104193 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4104194 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4104195 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

4104201 its worth checking out in fact its worth leaving a comment as he specifically asks for your opinion
4104202 post from a few days ago hes growing a mustache along with several other volunteer fire fighters where he serves
4104203 i think this will be the peak reading in inflation
4104204 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worse of the inflation readings
4104205 the way i judge the market reaction is that they are certainly looking at those increases as well but if you are focused more on the forward looking drivers of inflation i think we have probably seen for the near term anyway a peak in the acceleration in the inflation numbers
4104206 bond prices slipped because the inflation numbers were higher than expected
4104207 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while if inflation moderates along with the commodity markets monetary policymakers will probably focus more on the housing problems and worry less about inflation that will allow the fed to hold interest rates steady into the early part of next year
4104208 higher inflation is positive for short term interest rates in general but an inflation driven rise in yields wouldnt necessarily be good for the dollar in the medium term second thing we have jobless claims which remain high and this still reflects softness in the labor market and thats why were seeing the dollar slip a little bit
4104209 what we didnt catch in our forecast is the increase in tobacco which explained why the core came in above forecast the headline is still a lot of energy and seasonal adjustments food continues to be a problem too
4104210 the overall picture is that inflation is still on the feds radar screen we dont expect the fed to change rate policy anytime soon
4104211 the core cpi number rose 0 3 percent and the headline number was pretty ugly for those who look at the headline number so the market sold off jobless claims dropped a little bit but not as much as expected claims were a sidebar to the inflation number

4104220 the ibm hci study clearly calls for the same rigor in talent analytics and management that ceos and cios require to make the strategic decisions their companies depend on
4104221 the challenge laid out for ibms clients is to treat their most valuable asset their people as their most competitive edge
4104222 the long term payoffs of strong talent management far outweigh the costs and complexities associated with upfront investments
4104223 this research proves that in todays increasingly globalized technology driven economy a strategic and integrated focus on talent can in fact help your organization prepare for corporate adolescence and financially outperform competitors no matter the size or industry
4104224 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4104225 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call after clashes in the georgian region of south ossetia russia invaded its neighbor launching attacks that threaten its very existence some americans may wonder why events in this part of the world are any concern of ours after all georgia is a small remote and obscure place but history is often made in remote obscure places as russian tanks and troops moved through the roki tunnel and across the internationally recognized border into georgia the russian government stated that it was acting only to protect ossetians yet regime change in georgia appears to be the true russian objective
4104226 russian claims of humanitarian motives were further belied by a bombing campaign that encompassed the whole of georgia destroying military bases apartment buildings and other infrastructure and leaving innocent civilians wounded and killed as the russian black sea fleet began concentrating off of the georgian coast and russian troops advanced on one city after another there could be no doubt about the nature of their aggression
4104227 in the wake of this crisis there are the stirrings of a new trans atlantic consensus about the way we should approach russia and its neighbors the leaders of poland estonia lithuania ukraine and latvia flew to tbilisi to demonstrate their support for georgia and to condemn russian aggression the french president traveled to moscow in an attempt to end the fighting the british foreign minister hinted of a g 8 without russia and the british opposition leader explicitly called for russia to be suspended from the grouping the world has learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked a cease fire that holds is a vital first step but only one with our allies we now must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to end violence permanently and withdraw its troops from georgia international monitors must gain immediate access to war torn areas in order to avert an even greater humanitarian disaster and we should ensure that emergency aid lifted by air and sea is delivered

4104247 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4104248 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4104249 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4104250 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4104251 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4104252 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4104253 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4104254 just so you all know we did set a record
4104255 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4104256 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4104257 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4104258 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4104259 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4104260 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4104261 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4104262 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4104263 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4104264 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4104265 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4104266 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4104267 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4104268 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4104269 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4104270 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4104271 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4104272 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4104273 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4104274 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4104275 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4104276 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4104277 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4104278 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4104279 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4104280 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4104281 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4104282 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4104283 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4104284 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4104285 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4104286 inzwischen haben die ministerien spa an der herausforderung gefunden bei den kosten besser zu werden
4104287 we have around 135 000 people who have left their homes there
4104288 we have directed officials in adjoining districts to provide shelter food and health care to the migrating families we are setting up more camps to help these people just like refugees
4104289 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4104290 operatives from the central intelligence organisation cio seized the mdc leaderships passports and briefly detained them saying their names were on the list
4104291 they did not reveal what so called list was about
4104292 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks hundreds and tens of meetings had been held
4104293 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4104294 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4104295 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4104296 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4104297 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4104298 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4104299 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

4104303 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4104304 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4104305 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4104306 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4104307 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4104308 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours

4104310 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4104311 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4104312 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

4104316 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4104317 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4104318 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4104319 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4104320 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4104321 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

4104330 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4104331 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4104332 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4104333 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4104334 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4104335 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

4104344 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4104345 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4104346 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4104347 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4104348 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4104349 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin

4104351 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4104352 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4104353 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4104354 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible

4104356 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4104357 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4104358 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4104359 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4104360 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4104361 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4104362 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

4104365 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4104366 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4104367 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4104368 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4104369 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4104370 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4104371 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4104372 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4104373 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4104374 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4104375 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4104376 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4104377 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4104378 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4104379 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4104380 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

4104399 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4104400 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4104401 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4104402 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4104403 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4104404 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4104405 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4104406 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4104407 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4104408 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4104409 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4104410 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4104411 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4104412 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4104413 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

4104418 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4104419 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4104420 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4104421 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4104422 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4104423 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4104424 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4104425 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4104426 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4104427 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4104428 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love

4104442 it was during my first field exercise less than five miles south of the d m z that sept 11 happened i knew at that very moment that i would end up in the middle east
4104443 sure enough i completed my time there and was shipped to ft polk la to join the 814th engineer company on the night of my 26th birthday jan 10 2003 we received our orders to kuwait
4104444 apparently someone didnt take too kindly to that and decided to shoot up our convoy on the way back to base i was hit with glass and shrapnel in the face and neck when the bullet passed through the cab of our truck

4104449 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4104450 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4104451 these are all small things and they all add up
4104452 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4104453 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4104454 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4104455 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am

4104457 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4104458 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4104459 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

4104469 it is our civic ethical and moral duty to ensure that our institutions are responsive to our collective needs i do not now nor will i ever choose to side with developers who do not have the interests of jamaicans in trelawny or elsewhere at the center of their plans
4104470 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
4104471 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4104472 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4104473 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4104474 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4104475 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4104476 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4104477 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4104478 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4104479 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4104480 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4104481 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4104482 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4104483 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4104484 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4104485 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

4104490 that is a good scripture to quote but you really need to understand the scriptures just before to be able to understand the weapons being formed against us and that one says this this is the lord speaking i myself have created the fire i myself have created the smith that blows the coals of fire to bring forth the weapon for my work and that is to bring to ruin the destroyer we thought the devil had us in the fire no the lord built the fire and he is saying if we can come out of that fire once that weapon that sword comes out of the fire then you can say no weapon against this is going to prosper and every tongue which rises against it in judgment will be condemned for such is the heritage of the servants of god i believe there is a necessity to come out of the fire to become that kind of a sword in the hands of the lord of hosts

4104494 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4104495 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4104496 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

4104572 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa

4104723 without outside help poland could have trouble retaining auschwitz as a memorial site
4104724 auschwitz birkenau has become an international symbol when we hear its name it tells us something about our humanity it is a warning stark clear and irrefutable precisely because the physical evidence is there it reminds us that human beings are capable of creating factories of death and of turning people to ashes we all need to be constantly reminded of that possibility we all need to pay the price of auschwitz whether the money comes from the european union or elsewhere 100m is a small sum to keep auschwitz birkenau firmly in our minds eye it is nothing compared to the cost of letting it conveniently fade imperceptibly from our fickle memories forever
4104725 our project is based on the premise hearing is not like seeing and has a profound impact on young people resulting in inspirational work carried out in their schools and local communities to educate others about the dangers of prejudice and racism today
4104726 auschwitz birkenau is a site for all humanity to learn from the mistakes of the past and thus it is also everybodys responsibility to ensure it is preserved so that its legacy lives on particularly as survivors of the holocaust become fewer and frailer
4104727 all the relevant parties in poland and the international community should assist
4104728 it should be noted that until this point in all the discussions that were held in the international auschwitz council on this issue and in all the documents presented regarding the issue of preserving the camp such large amounts of money were never raised this issue should be clarified through a professional study that will present the information to the professional bodies so that it will be possible to gauge the situation based on the appropriate standards

4104732 it was a wonderful gesture by his majesty and were just all very honoured to be here hes got a fantastic vision for the future
4104733 they said no thank you we were really touched and appreciative and if we ever wanted it open its no problem but the community is very small and hardly gets a minyan
4104734 it doesnt matter whether they are jewish or christian or muslim or whatever
4104735 bahrain has reached out for hundreds of years we have got at least 30 churches in a very small country and mosques next to churches and synagogues next to churches they are all living there and i think this is the real arab neighbourhood

4104821 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4104822 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4104823 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4104824 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4104825 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4104826 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4104827 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4104828 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4104829 but doesnt it hook to the laptop in some special way or something
4104830 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4104831 i listened to the song over and over again and i said i think i have really hurt this person
4104832 we saw each other and hung out for an entire day
4104833 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4104834 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4104835 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4104836 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4104837 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4104838 now im not one to judge someone that i aint never met
4104839 but to lay your hand on a married mans bout as low as a gal can get hey i wish her well as she rots in hell and you can tell her i said so cheater cheater whered you meet that no good white trash ho
4104840 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4104841 stop protecting those accused of corruption deeds leave justice do its job and name the guilty and the innocent
4104842 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4104843 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4104844 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4104845 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4104846 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4104847 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4104848 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4104849 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4104850 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4104851 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4104852 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4104853 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4104854 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4104855 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4104856 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4104857 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4104858 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4104859 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4104860 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4104861 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4104862 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4104863 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4104864 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4104865 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4104866 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4104867 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4104868 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4104869 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4104870 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4104871 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4104872 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4104873 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4104874 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4104875 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4104876 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4104877 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4104878 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4104879 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4104880 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4104881 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4104882 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4104883 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4104884 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4104885 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4104886 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4104887 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4104888 who are open to doing something on the production side
4104889 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4104890 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4104891 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4104892 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4104893 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4104894 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4104895 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4104896 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4104897 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4104898 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4104899 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4104900 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4104901 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4104902 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4104903 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4104904 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4104905 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4104906 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4104907 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4104908 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4104909 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4104910 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4104911 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4104912 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4104913 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4104914 i think its kind of crazy that a woman is running because i think that women deal with a lot of emotions and menopause and pms and stuff like im so moody all the time i know i couldnt be able to run a country because i would be crying one day and yelling at people the next day you know

4104916 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences

4104919 the mapps members clearly prefer senator mccain based on his record on business issues taxes foreign policy and national defense
4104920 the margin in the poll demonstrates that mapps members view the 2008 presidential election as a clear choice
4104921 this is an interesting role reversal because the employer came here to make a sales pitch to us
4104922 that ought to be our goal but we need to get them to apply first
4104923 we are taking a very intimate approach by going out into the neighborhoods and to neighborhood based organizations to provide a lot of details about the application process
4104924 you only work eight days a month 24 hours on and 72 hours off

4104926 the stick is that youre running into a burning building when everyone else is running out but youd pay good money for that adrenaline rush its the best feeling in the world when you get to help someone
4104927 when we sang along with the radio in my house we sang harmonies you always had to find your own part and fit in with everyone else
4104928 music is an endless pursuit of the unattainable for me
4104929 the essence of creativity lies deep within each of us a place where everything is still
4104930 i wanted to move people the way that moved me
4104931 as soon as i heard clayton sing we had the idea not only to write together but start a band
4104932 when i got to the audition i was skeptical due to my different musical background but then i heard clayton sing i knew right away that this was something i wanted to be a part of within the first couple of weeks we were playing before 500 600 screaming college kids
4104933 i was able to put the right amount of emotion into them theyre more than just boy meets girl fluff scott touches on themes about the darker side of sanity and the horrors of events like 9 11
4104934 i was in another group playing around santa barbara but i used to watch these guys all the time and was kind of in awe
4104935 they were on a whole other level the kind of band i wanted to be in
4104936 you start a group not knowing if its going to work out
4104937 theres always the uncertainty deciding whether to place a time limit on how long youre going to keep going but the deeper you get into it the more work you put in the harder it is to let go
4104938 were coming with something thats not necessarily here today and gone tomorrow
4104939 for the past few years our main worry and obsession was getting a record deal
4104940 and now that weve got one its been replaced by a whole new set of worries and obsessions i guess thats life
4104941 and a big part of that is how you come across live in concert its important for us to put on an inspiring entertaining kick ass show
4104942 honestly were most vested in our music and how we perform it
4104943 when it comes to thriving ivory its not a matter of if its when
4104944 they sound like theyd be right at home in a big arena
4104945 a band like thriving ivory is one in a million
4104946 literally melts you away with his ability to completely take control of the song and the listener
4104947 as soon as i heard clayton sing that was pretty much it lets form a band
4104948 scotts songs have this wonderful lyrical depth to them and are very accessible
4104949 it is so easy to put my vocal emotions into them
4104950 i knew right away that this was something i wanted to be a part of within the first couple of weeks we were playing before 500 to 600 screaming college kids
4104951 i was in another group playing around santa barbara but i used to watch these guys all the time and was kind of in awe
4104952 they were on a whole other level the kind of band i wanted to be in
4104953 it was surprisingly melodic sweeping and triumphant the vocals were raw gritty and yet refined and pleasantly reminiscent of a young robert plant the piano was simply enchanting providing a sturdy backbone for their sound which was rounded off with laid back guitar riffs smooth bass and rhythmic drums their music is larger than they know the band exudes a cohesion found only in seasoned bands like the rolling stones and yet they are seemingly unaware of how big they could be
4104954 s weeping majestic songs with catchy choruses and really really wonderful vocals and an awesome backdrop of piano
4104955 clayton stroope the bands frontman has a voice thats a throwback to classic rock opera vocal cords and a swagger and shimmy reminiscent of robert plant in the song remains the same
4104956 throw a pouty jagger esque pucker into the equation and hes an obvious centerpiece
4104957 music is an endless pursuit of the unattainable for me
4104958 i want to move people the way that moved me
4104959 we want our songs to be something that will stand the test of time

4104961 jadi orang itu mesti kritis lho kar supaya tidak gampang dikibuli dibohongi setidaknya kita mampu mendeteksi gejala gejalanya agar virus tidak menyebar kemana mana supaya sekitar kita tidak gampang lekas sakit
4104962 masak sih eyang kalau begitu jangan jangan malahan kepulan asap rokok lintingan eyang yang meracuni semua udara di sini pengap
4104963 ya ndak mesti gitu juga karyo masak aku harus sumpal mulutmu itu ya ndak bisa seperti demikian
4104964 lagipula aku juga tidak ingin kalau mulutku ikut ikutan disumpal lha nanti aku tidak bisa menghisap lintingan daun kaung ini bagaimana hayo
4104965 tidak usah diragukan lagi eyang mulut eyang itu lebih kalah daripada bibir knalpot bus yang sudah kayak kaleng krupuk itu tapi untungnya masih bisa ngangkut siapa pun yang rela berdesak desakan untuk bisa mendapat tempat duduk yang murah asal sampai tujuan pun juga sudah untung ketimbang bayar mahal tapi simpanan dapur kependel sama itu ongkos wah bisa bisa isteri cucumu ini kebakaran jenggot eyang
4104966 ya ndak mesti juga seperti itu eyang masak seperti tidak tahu pepatah saja memangnya unur lanjut itu digunakan untuk apa saja sampai kias semudah itu tidak bisa dimengerti
4104967 bukan karena usia sudah melar he karyo meski ada benarnya
4104968 juga bukan hanya itu saja masalahnya eyangmu ini kan sudah melewati masa masa yang begitu panjang dan melelahkan jadi segala ingatan itu mesti diproses lebih dahulu biar lambat tapi memang begitu untuk ukuran kepala yang katamu itu sudah tidak layak pakai yang justru untuk mengenang kembali semua ingatan ingatan masa lampau itu di saat sekaranglah untuk diingat ingat lagi tapi bukan sebagai seseorang yang kembali menjadi anak kecil setidaknya kembali kepada kesadaran bahwa semua itu telah jauh terlewati
4104969 ya masa masa yang telah lalu sekarang malah kau sendiri yang menanyakan dan jangan berpikiran kalau aku sudah pikun ya tidak baik ingatanku ini masih baik baik saja setidaknya begitulah menurutku
4104970 tapi eyang jangan marah seperti itu cucumu ini tidak secara sengaja mencoba untuk meledek atau sesuatu hal yang seperti itu sama sekali tidak terlintas pikiran itu
4104971 jangan berteriak aku masih sanggup mendengar biar sudah berkurang pendengaranku tapi masih cukup peka untuk menangkap bisikan bisikan itu hati hati saja telinga ini masih berfungsi mataku masih awas biar sedikit rabun tapi masih dapat melihat lubang jarum dalam matamu he orang muda dasar anak jaman sekarang
4104972 bukannya ndak mau mengalah eyang tapi kalau ada pikiran yang rasa rasanya menyimpang daripada kebenaran apa salahnya kan kalau diluruskan biar itu butuh keberanian dan dapat saja dianggap berontak untuk kebenaran apa salahnya sedikit mengalah begitu lho
4104973 kalau ndak suka keluar saja toh di sana ada banyak udara yang kau butuhkan
4104974 seharusnya eyang saja yang berhenti menghisap barang seperti itu tidak baik merusak paru paru lingkungan dan entah
4104975 kalau aku berhenti akan ada banyak orang kehilangan pekerjaan mereka kalau tidak ada orang seperti aku ini rumah rumah sakit dan toko toko obat akan sepi pembeli kamu sendiri yang bilang kalau mencari pekerjaan di jaman sekarang benar benar sulit bahkan ada rumor segala yang mengatakan kalau tidak ada koneksi atau kerabat dekat tidak mendapat pekerjaan benar ndak
4104976 entahlah eyang saya tidak bisa menjawabnya untuk sementara atau memang dunia ini sudah kacau atau seperti ember somplak yang sudah tidak dapat lagi ditambal
4104977 hah kalau begitu itu urusanmu sekarang untuk meneruskan dunia ini masaku tinggal hanya menunggu sambil menonton terakhir yang kuingat dan terus menerus menjadi mimpi yang juga akan menghantui sisa hidupku kalau aku akan berakhir hanya pada sebuah lubang dan di atasnya tertancap batu nisan yang bertuliskan bukan siapa siapa bereskan

4104988 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion i wrote to the organizations in question protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
4104989 healthcare providers should be allowed to believe any fool thing about when a pregnancy begins and what constitutes an abortion a position i think is stupid but fine and to inflict that upon you without any consequences
4104990 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
4104991 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside they are full of robbery and self indulgence

4104995 larry was shot down on september 30 1968 they closed his case in 1978 in fact john mccain who is a very dangerous and violent man was the driving force behind closing all the pow files classifying records in order to keep the truth from the families and the american people
4104996 mccain is even more dangerous than bush i dont want to see this man ever become president and thats why i want this story out because he is one of the biggest liars in our government and by no means a friend of the pow families
4104997 after backstabbing all of us hiding the truth about the pow story i wish they would have kept him in a prison camp for life like so many others who didnt have his military and political clout if they lied to us about this just think about the lies spread about 9 11 and the present day war in iraq
4104998 when i told him again straight to his face that you know col atkins briefed you about many things including the truth of the pows he look at me with wide open eyes saying nothing but his jaw literally dropped to the floor
4104999 i talked to col atkins many times about cia files he had uncovered with oliver north about john mccain telling the real truth about mccains pow captivity also atkins told me he was a liaison between bush and north the pair traveling on irish passports during iran contra
4105000 i know for a fact sen bob smith who was trying to help us get at the truth in the senate hearings on the pow issue never got a chance to depose col atkins since he was arrested and then jailed for years over iran contra
4105001 they didnt want him to talk about a lot of things but he talked to me about mccains cia file and many things the senator wants kept from the american people
4105002 people need to know the truth about mccain he sealed his own records as well the records of all pows so he could continue lying about his pow experience he was never tortured never in a dog cell like the other prisoners and never deprived of food
4105003 without a doubt i didnt see mccain for at least a year
4105004 why have the north vietnamese honored him what did mccain tell them and how was he really treated
4105005 they gave him special treatment and it is documented he was even out of the country for two years instead of being in solitary confinement
4105006 according to my very credible vietnamese contacts he had an affair with the sister of nguyen tan thanh a high placed north vietnamese official since they knew mccain was the son of a navy admiral he was given a special nurse tans sister ive been told he fathered two sons with her one attending the university of colorado up until now though we havent been able to get their names
4105007 i remember my husband saying he was not well liked and thought of as a hot dog and a punk
4105008 and nothing has changed over the years once when pow families were outside his senate office on capital hill demanding answers he pushed his way through the crowd in a violent manner refusing to answer questions almost knocking a pow supporter over in her wheel chair
4105009 all the unresolved matters relating to any united states personnel unaccounted for from the vietnam era the korean conflict ww ii the cold war missions and the gulf wars including all issues regarding mias and pows

4105136 whenever luther formulated confessions or articles of faith he regularly began with the doctrine of god in its trinitarian form for this reason it would seem appropriate to give the doctrine of god the central position in luthers theology
4105137 these articles are not matters of dispute or contention for both parties believe and confess them therefore it is not necessary to treat them at greater length
4105138 naturally luther did not intend to imply that the dogma of the trinity was not firmly maintained in the roman church for luther however faith in the triune god simultaneously required a specific doctrine of the human person and a specific doctrine of salvation that is faith in the triune god required the reformation doctrine of justification for luther simply accepting dogmas as true was not enough

4105338 it definitely was all along we have been saying that we need to get back to consistency and be sure not to miss any opportunities if we want to be a part of the chase this season pocono was probably a missed opportunity and i think we all left feeling like we didnt show as well as we would have liked then to be right on the edge as far as point and the chase it wasnt a good feeling at watkins glen we just didnt have the car to race with the leaders but we had a top ten car and thats where we finished as hard as it is to have to hold back sometimes i knew that if i really pushed i would have wrecked and that would have been the worst that could have happened for this team so we did what we had to do we scored a top ten that gives us just a little breathing room and well look forward to michigan
4105339 we have been inspired by mr kennedys support of mothers positions on vaccines and his ground breaking article
4105340 do support immunization like many parents and experts in the medical community although they and their many allies feel that children are receiving too many vaccines too soon many of which are toxic their goal is to demand a safer vaccine supply and schedule for children

4105342 the news kept showing clips of the president delivering a speech earlier that day at a breakfast in texas
4105343 the same speech i had gone over with him in the oval office on the morning of his departure
4105344 the news kept showing clips of the president delivering a speech earlier that day at a breakfast in texas
4105345 the same speech i had gone over with him in the oval office on the morning of his departure
4105346 the final shape of every text was always the presidents decision alone
4105347 the principal architect of the inaugural address was john fitzgerald kennedy
4105348 ask not what your country is going to do for you
4105349 the author of so many of kennedys speeches including the inaugural
4105350 john kennedys inaugural address has been praised as one of the best public speeches ever kennedy however did not write the speech himself ted sorensen did
4105351 the great deluge hurricane katrina new orleans and the mississippi gulf coast

4105353 this is my running mate in whom im well pleased
4105354 iranian nuclear weapons do not pose an existential threat to israel
4105355 she could be a first class ambassador to many countries but the post of prime minister in israel requires something else and i am afraid she does not have the wide scope that this job requires
4105356 livni is not made from the material that leaders are made out of she cannot make big decisions she never has not as justice minister and not as foreign minister
4105357 shes too close to the lane marker thats just a huge mental lapse you cant compete at this level and make mistakes like that i think her shoulder actually touched the marker it did i saw it move that will cost her time she cant spare well if shes going to make that mistake she shouldnt try to correct back to the middle yes she should just stay there cant she see the lines on the ceiling yes if she were focused she could use those as guides
4105358 no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
4105359 the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics
4105360 said russia can no longer view a man who issued orders to commit war crimes as a negotiating partner and therefore without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
4105361 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
4105362 i had a long talk with vladimir there in slovakia about democracy and about the importance of democracy and as you remember at the press conference he stood up and said he strongly supports democracy i take him for his word
4105363 in spite of the hardness and ruthlessness i thought i saw in his face i got the impression that here was a man who could be relied upon when he had given his word
4105364 you have only to look at the map to see that nothing that france or we could do could possibly save czechoslovakia from being overrun by the germans if they wanted to do it i have therefore abandoned any idea of giving guarantees to czechoslovakia or to the french in connection with her obligations to that country
4105365 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been scattered
4105366 the conservative movement figured this was a battle won and walked away from it because the military continued to expel openly homosexual people
4105367 this was not wise because the threat has grown in a near vacuum of news about the aggressive campaign behind the scenes by homosexual activists
4105368 if only one side is on the battlefield that is the side that is going to prevail but i dont think its too late for conservatives to rally behind the military and support the ban
4105369 the republicans didnt show up figuratively and literally a few showed up literally but even those that were there didnt put up a strong case for keeping the ban
4105370 theres no limit to how viciously homosexual activists will attack you if you cross them
4105371 no one likes to be called a bigot and hateful i think republicans dont want to be labeled in that way
4105372 our challenge is to examine and determine whether that conclusion of 1993 remains valid here in 2008
4105373 some are saying to me elaine let me hold your coat as you go into battle if they had been more outspoken there would have been more republicans in the hearing room if republicans are willing to fight obama on this the willingness is not visible its not there
4105374 do you favor or oppose allowing openly gay men and lesbian women to serve in the military
4105375 i think that it shows the success of the propaganda campaign that homosexual activists have been waging
4105376 there has been success in their effort to portray this as a civli rights issue
4105377 i think conservatives forgot the lesson that victories are never permanent you always have to fight some battles over and over the fact that liberals are trying to do this again while americans are at war means they are confident the culture has become so socially liberal that they can get away with it
4105378 if obama comes in the way bill clinton did in 93 and has this as one of his first initiatives im hoping there will be more public reaction than there is at this point

4105383 it is clear from the context that hillary was invoking a familiar political circumstance in order to support her decision to stay in the race through june i have heard her make this reference before also citing her husbands 1992 race both of which were hard fought through june i understand how highly charged the atmosphere is but i think it is a mistake for people to take offense
4105384 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
4105385 in fact i normally tell people that anyone can drive michigan it is so wide that cars can race three and four wide there every lap it is one of my favorite race tracks because it is so fun to drive we didnt have a good race at michigan in june so we really want to improve on our performance
4105386 it is typically a good track for us so im looking forward to rebounding from the last race and having a good run
4105387 we have been working diligently on our seven post rig track testing and improving our cars in the shop
4105388 michigan is a great track and it promotes great racing because of the long sweeping corners the key to michigan is handling and being able to go into turn 3 without being loose then come off turn 4 strong for the frontstretch
4105389 i dont see why we dont get on with it and endorse
4105390 i dont want to push her nobody is going to push her
4105391 but the sooner she does i think the more likely were going to be organized and ready to win in november
4105392 were going to be having a conversation in coming weeks and im very confident how unified the democratic partys going to be to win in november
4105393 i dont really think that the way to get obama to choose clinton would be to put pressure on him i think it would have the opposite effect
4105394 shes very resolved but open minded about whatevers coming shes going forward with an optimistic eye
4105395 i expect mrs clinton to say some things over the next couple of days and i think thats appropriate for her to do and i expect her to say that at which time i may make a more formal
4105396 i am pleased to report that senator kennedys surgery was successful and accomplished our goals

4105399 after completing treatment i look forward to returning to the united states senate and to doing everything i can to help elect barack obama as our next president

4105402 dont worry youll be the democratic presidential nominee in 1960 whats more youll be elected
4105403 thats funny for the life of me i cant remember tapping either of you two boys for the job

4105408 we knew what was going to happen that eventually we were both going to be divorced and we were going to go through hell which we did but the ring of fire was not the hell that was kind of a sweet fire the ring of fire that i found myself in with june was the fire of redemption it cleansed it made me believe everything was all right because it felt so good

4105410 in our study carotid endarterectomy achieved low rates of post surgical mortality and morbidity and translated into long term freedom from stroke in high risk patients despite their poor health
4105411 the presence of multiple medical comorbidities is not sufficient to automatically rule out this treatment which has demonstrated long term efficacy in preventing stroke in medically high risk patients

4105417 in my research of multinational companies 17 of manufacturers are moving investments out of china

4105459 as well as bringing you to your knees he makes you laugh and thats the shock its the divine comedy there are very very few people who occupy the ground that leonard cohen walks on as dark as it gets you still feel that beauty is truth

4105461 popular song is very useful it provides the soundtrack to courting to loss to love to doing the dishes to various chores it has a real utilitarian aspect
4105462 thats what i love about it that people have been able to use the songs as the background to important moments in their lives
4105463 i like my songs to last as long as a volvo
4105464 thirty or 40 years is what they used to advertise
4105465 a good song a good lyric is a movie it will just focus and calm and confer significance on this completely bewildering reality that all of us live in whether you use a very complex approach like i use hallejulah famously took him five years to write and actually runs to 80 verses or a very simple approach like a blues singer would use what brings a song to life and drives it home drives it to the heart is a process i really cant penetrate
4105466 my writing is i would say exclusively about my own life
4105467 its not modesty that compels you to see where you stand in this whole affair
4105468 i tried to cultivate a small corner of a garden and ive done it the best i can as a novelist and as a poet and as a songwriter
4105469 its a very limited corner but its the one i know and its the one ive worked on as best i can
4105470 when you no longer see yourself as the hero of your own drama expecting victory after victory and you understand deeply that this is not paradise i found that things became a lot easier
4105471 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
4105472 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
4105473 i had a little i guess you could call it a sleepover with someone i had known for a while
4105474 wed always had girlfriends or boyfriends and then we both came to the games single and after our events were over it was kind of like oh were both single it just sort of happened
4105475 you get a lot of people who are in shape and you know testosterones up and everybodys attracted to everybody
4105476 everybodys fit beyond belief and were all definitely red blooded humans that want to meet each other
4105477 we were walking through the athletes village and the italian girls came over to me and said so and so sent you an e mail and shes over there and she really wants to meet you
4105478 i know a lot of couples where one flies home to canada one flies home to italy the next day
4105479 its kind of like going to las vegas what happens there stays there
4105480 i found it very professional i think people like to think of it as a big party an orgy or whatever
4105481 but theyre not really experienced partiers people who have dedicated their whole lives to running they have a couple drinks and they get a little bit crazy
4105482 they put you in university style dorms and theres usually two single beds in the room so that was kind of weird because were used to sleeping together
4105483 i know that sounds kind of silly because youre in the same room but just to reach over and hold his hand or touch him and make sure hes there i needed that
4105484 its not really something youre thinking about whether youre with your husband or not
4105485 it was something along the lines of i awoke to a rustling under the cover at 6 52 and then there was a quote of max saying i know she couldnt work too hard because she had to conserve her energy
4105486 and max said in german this was his quote and the only quote we gave from those olympic games regarding us being together if she wins you can write whatever you want
4105487 i never gave a quote i would never give a quote
4105488 since 92 the men remember that im the girl who did it and the women remember that my husband cried on cbc
4105489 if i was a hollywood star i would have sued or something
4105490 it is time the international community helped ease israel out from its fantasy world where stone and concrete equals right and justice
4105491 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system
4105492 everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status
4105493 it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important
4105494 while on the one hand lehman has successfully transformed from a one business firm to a more diversified investment bank lehman remains the most fixed income sensitive firm
4105495 asset management remains a highly valuable asset leading us to believe that a potential neuberger monetization would not be motivated by capital shortfall but rather unlocking shareholder value and we think leaves the door open for a partial spin versus outright sale
4105496 opens the door to contemplating a potential bank acquisition though management stopped short of seeing an outright sale to a bank or going private as reasonable attractive alternatives
4105497 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year

4105537 i think we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
4105538 my preoccupation and responsibility is to ensure that the games competitions are reported openly to the world
4105539 didnt necessarily extend to free access and reporting on everything that relates to china
4105540 i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
4105541 providing a large number of journalists with a censored internet connection when they were promised an open internet is naturally going to draw a lot of critical stories in the media
4105542 i cant rely on getting all the information i need
4105543 so that it is not exploited by those who want independence
4105544 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to web sites that they need to report on the olympic games
4105545 has always been assured by the beijing organizing committee and the chinese authorities and the ioc is pleased to see these reassurances being upheld

4105552 we had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay
4105553 i know my job and that is to keep the best players from last season and find the best players to add to the squad
4105554 he was available for transfer he played a lot of years in england and he would like to do a new thing so in respect for him and his career without any fighting we let him go
4105555 last season we had some players who were injured but all of them are coming back
4105556 the tinshill mini breeze was so successful last year that we cajoled the relevant bodies and told them it just had to go ahead again this year everybody had a fantastic time at the last one we had people telling us that it was the best thing to happen in the area for 30 years
4105557 we are thrilled that the festival is to return the event is completely free and promises to be even better than last years with bouncy castles face painting a techno bus and many other fun activities there is something for everyone in the family to enjoy
4105558 what the heck she wants to get out of traverse city i have an empty house with 2 bedrooms maybe shed be interested in living there for a while until she figures out where she wants to go

4105564 the only part of fayetteville ive seen is this stadium
4105565 i think its actually really nice i dont know how big fayetteville is but this is a good size arena for a town
4105566 we just needed something that looked like a nice beautiful big time basketball arena
4105567 its a lot of work to come and shoot for one day
4105568 what took so long for the authorities to go there
4105569 we are creating one of the nations biggest interactive agencies which will allow us to grow current relationships and build new ones quite dramatically
4105570 the interactive marketing landscape is rapidly shifting from mass to personalized targeting and from fuzzy equity measures to precisely measured managed and optimized customer relationship economics
4105571 so tell me how you stay in touch with 500 linkedin folks
4105572 the brain is wider than the sky for put them side by side the one the other will include with ease and you beside
4105573 we will pursue peace as if there is no terrorism and fight terrorism as if there is no peace
4105574 i have thought it my duty to exhibit things as they are not as they ought to be
4105575 the stakes are too high for government to be a spectator sport
4105576 under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule and both commonly succeed and are right
4105577 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
4105578 i have had my solutions for a long time but i do not yet know how i am to arrive at them
4105579 whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to extensive empire the power of rome was attended with some beneficial consequences to mankind and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices diffused likewise the improvements of social life
4105580 augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom
4105581 there exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times
4105582 our youth now loves luxuries they have bad manners contempt for authority they show disrespect for elders and they love to chatter instead of exercise children are now tyrants not the servants of their households they no longer rise when elders enter the room they contradict their parents chatter before company gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers
4105583 before impugning an opponents motives even when they legitimately may be impugned answer his arguments
4105584 idealism alas does not protect one from ignorance dogmatism and foolishness
4105585 let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that i am persecuted whenever i am contradicted
4105586 we take and must continue to take morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization we must exercise our power but we ought neither to believe that a nation is capable of perfect disinterestedness in its exercise nor become complacent about particular degrees of interest and passion which corrupt the justice by which the exercise of power is legitimized
4105587 faced with the choice of all the land without a jewish state or a jewish state without all the land we chose a jewish state without all the land
4105588 the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis
4105589 he too serves a certain purpose who only stands and cheers
4105590 the law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to beg in the streets steal bread or sleep under a bridge
4105591 when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle
4105592 education does not mean that we have become certified experts in business or mining or botany or journalism or epistemology it means that through the absorption of the moral intellectual and esthetic inheritance of the race we have come to understand and control ourselves as well as the external world that we have chosen the best as our associates both in spirit and the flesh that we have learned to add courtesy to culture wisdom to knowledge and forgiveness to understanding
4105593 glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
4105594 the most important political office is that of the private citizen
4105595 if we desire respect for the law we must first make the law respectable
4105596 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both
4105597 it is an error to suppose that books have no influence it is a slow influence like flowing water carving out a canyon but it tells more and more with every year and no one can pass an hour a day in the society of sages and heroes without being lifted up a notch or two by the company he has kept
4105598 when you write youre trying to transpose what youre thinking into something that is less like an annoying drone and more like a piece of music
4105599 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
4105600 the sum of our religion is peace and unanimity but these can scarcely stand unless we define as little as possible and in many things leave one free to follow his own judgment because there is great obscurity in many matters and man suffers from this almost congenital disease that he will not give in when once a controversy is started and after he is heated he regards as absolutely true that which he began to sponsor quite casually
4105601 are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy and who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched is a priest to be our inquisitor or shall a layman simple as ourselves set up his reason as the rule of what we are to read and what we must disbelieve
4105602 we are told that it is only peoples objective actions that matter and their subjective feelings are of no importance thus pacifists by obstructing the war effort are objectively aiding the nazis and therefore the fact that they may be personally hostile to fascism is irrelevant i have been guilty of saying this myself more than once the same argument is applied to trotskyism trotskyists are often credited at any rate by communists with being active and conscious agents of hitler but when you point out the many and obvious reasons why this is unlikely to be true the objectively line of talk is brought forward again to criticize the soviet union helps hitler therefore trotskyism is fascism and when this has been established the accusation of conscious treachery is usually repeated this is not only dishonest it also carries a severe penalty with it if you disregard peoples motives it becomes much harder to foresee their actions
4105603 wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turn on
4105604 the great thing about human language is that it prevents us from sticking to the matter at hand
4105605 to be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a child for what is mans lifetime unless the memory of past events is woven with those of earlier times
4105606 reputation is what other people know about you honor is what you know about yourself

4105616 after a 9 4 season in 2007 a lot of badger fans might be happy with a return to last years form
4105617 but with the big ten network still showing badger games and wisconsin cable companies still not offering the channel theres at least one part of last years season that fans would rather leave behind
4105618 the good news for consumers is that while some wisconsin cable providers continue to stall on providing the big ten network to their customers new alternatives are emerging as a result of cable competition legislation but until the benefits of competition reach everyone in wisconsin its going to be like 2007 all over again for better and for worse
4105619 we need to make significant progress in the next couple of days and i think we will know in the next week or so whether the likelihood of the network and deal getting done with time warner or not

4105627 the russian bear is trying to choke the vital east west energy arteries in the caucasus specifically the btc oil pipeline and the gas pipeline

4105629 its a strong message to have eight players who are such a big part of our future quest for premiership success all coming out in the one week and agreeing to terms its a great message of solidarity

4105648 we at ford see this years consumer shift to smaller vehicles as an opportunity and one that ford is uniquely positioned to answer using the strength of our european small car lineup and our fast moving global product plan
4105649 we plan to answer the call with dynamic fun to drive small cars and we intend to make them profitably
4105650 weve reduced the number of orderable combinations in north america including series packages and options by 90 percent for the ford brand alone in the 2008 2009 model years
4105651 if you look at the c segment focus will provide approximately 150 combinations by the 2010 model year more than a 95 percent reduction versus the 2008 model year
4105652 were making stylish high quality products to appeal a new breed of buyers
4105653 our small cars need to be more ambitious vehicles than ever delivering style perceived quality and appealing to lifestyle not life stage
4105654 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
4105655 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
4105656 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
4105657 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving

4105682 im so proud of what weve done that was my last major championship its time to hang the racket up
4105683 we were playing well in the first set but we didnt quite reach the levels of our match against the chinese

4105685 emmanuel bensah somehow manages to make me nostalgic for tro tros the overcrowded sweaty unsafe minivans that serve as transport for most urban ghanaians his photo series of a trip from east legon near where i used to go to school to downtown passing the national theatre of ghana where i spent countless hours studying with bernard woma is hugely nostalgic for me it reminded me that those motorized sardine cans were the best possible introduction to ghanaian color culture humor patience grace and goodwill

4105692 om een kans te krijgen bij de gevestigde media moeten jonge tekenaars eerst naamsbekendheid verwerven en daarvoor is internet een zeer geschikt medium
4105693 wat het lastig maakt is dat de oudere tekenaars bij kranten en tijdschriften lang blijven zitten cru gezegd moeten jongere tekenaars wachten tot de oudere generatie doodgaat om een kans te krijgen
4105694 als je werk leuk of goed genoeg is dan maak je echt nog wel een kans bij geprinte media maar toch zal ik altijd online blijven publiceren
4105695 toen ik begon met het publiceren van mijn cartoons was er geen vraag naar vanuit de oude media ze pasten niet zo bij de linkse tijdgeest van toen daarom heb ik mijn eigen platform gecre erd
4105696 via internet kan ik mijn cartoons en idee n binnen enkele minuten publiceren het belang daarvan is direct tot mij doorgedrongen ook hoef ik niemand om toestemming te vragen voor ik iets plaats ik heb collegas bij kranten en tijdschriften die hun tekeningen aan redacties moeten voorleggen en er wordt soms in gerommeld ook kunnen zij hun cartoons vaak niet zomaar op hun eigen site plaatsen
4105697 toen bijvoorbeeld de pers verscheen zeiden ze dat ze een spraakmakende krant wilden maken maar ik vind de cartoons die erin staan toch erg braafjes volgens mij is dat uit angst voor de adverteerders ik krijg zelf natuurlijk ook wel eens negatieve reacties op internet maar dat heeft in ieder geval geen economische gevolgen
4105698 ik zie het internet als een oneindig tekenvel je kunt het plaatje zo groot of klein maken als je zelf wilt
4105699 het online publiek waardeert het enorm als een cartoonist moeite steekt in zijn eigen website dus moeten er geregeld cartoons verschijnen die nergens anders zijn geplaatst als ik een paar weken geen tijd heb om speciaal voor nozzman nl iets te produceren krijg ik het verwijt dat ik alleen maar cartoons doorplaats
4105700 ik ben er vanaf gestapt want er kwamen allemaal gekken op bezoek die van alles schreven dat niet te zake deed of die afspraken om elkaar ergens te treffen voor relletjes bijvoorbeeld ik had geen zin om de hele dag te modereren als mensen iets kwijt willen dan beginnen ze zelf maar een weblog

4105756 antes que ellos llegaran no hab a forma de que pusieran un pie en este pa s
4105757 what she looks just like that girl from the olympics i thought she was legal
4105758 he seems to really put investors first says jacob zamansky a securities lawyer specializing in cases against brokerage firm and a critic of the reimbursements clients received in spitzers landmark analyst and mutual fund trading settlements
4105759 spitzer seemed more interested in photo opportunities than in getting real reform
4105760 theres less complaining from the industry people about zealots and bullies zamanksy said you have to be reasonable with the firms and i think the cuomo people get credit for that
4105761 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4105762 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4105763 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4105764 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4105765 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4105766 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4105767 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4105768 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4105769 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4105770 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4105771 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4105772 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
4105773 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
4105774 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4105775 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4105776 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4105777 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4105778 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4105779 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4105780 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4105781 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
4105782 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
4105783 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
4105784 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
4105785 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
4105786 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
4105787 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
4105788 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
4105789 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
4105790 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
4105791 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
4105792 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
4105793 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4105794 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4105795 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4105796 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4105797 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4105798 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4105799 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4105800 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4105801 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4105802 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4105803 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4105804 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4105805 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4105806 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4105807 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4105808 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4105809 buoyant and lively at times melancholy and dark at others
4105810 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
4105811 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
4105812 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
4105813 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
4105814 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
4105815 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
4105816 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4105817 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4105818 this is simply an attempt to prevent morgan tsvangirai from attending the sadc meeting to which he has been invited
4105819 this is a demonstration of a lack of sincerity on the part of the government of robert mugabe
4105820 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4105821 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4105822 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4105823 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4105824 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4105825 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4105826 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4105827 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers

4105829 who are you how many hit records do you have
4105830 back in college when me and my roommates would get hammered and rap along to victory id yell to no one in particular that this was one of the 10 greatest hip hop songs of all time while clutching a quart of mickeys ice in one hand and a half eaten totinos party pizza in the other well just so you know heres a partial list of other things i thought were pretty great back then drunk driving self immolation ramen noodles the wwf phishs billy breathes and the career prospects of florida gators qb jesse palmer a k a the guy who ended up on the bachelor

4105832 carlitos way rise to power is perhaps the finest direct to dvd prequel to a substandard brian de palma al pacino gangster flick that also stars mario van peebles and that guy who played maurice tt rodriguez in boogie nights to be released this decade or at least in the past five years
4105833 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
4105834 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind
4105835 your skin is way smoother than i wouldve imagined given the amount of times i have seen your proactiv commercial
4105836 in tons how many magick talismans ancient tomes aleister crowley artifacts did it take to convince jimmy page to appear in the video for that god awful song you did on the godzilla soundtrack
4105837 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
4105838 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
4105839 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4105840 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4105845 vrem parteneriate cu locatii aflate in apropierea consumatorilor finali iar astfel de locatii nu le poti gasi intotdeauna in benzinarii si supermarketuri avem discutii si cu furnizorii de energie potentialul pietei romanesti este foarte mare vrem o cota cat mai mare din piata
4105846 am ales sa investim in romania pentru ca studiul pietei a aratat pe langa potentialul urias al pietei si compatibilitatea dintre serviciile oferite de paypoint si nevoile consumatorilor avem deja contracte semnate cu unii dintre cei mai importanti furnizori locali de servicii si utilitati si continuam negocierile pentru a ne extinde atat serviciile cat si reteaua de retaileri
4105847 ce ne a determinat sa venim in romania este economia dinamica dezvoltarea sistemelor de plata si faptul ca 95 din romani prefera sa plateasca facturile in numerar
4105848 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4105849 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4105850 our expanded research effort has led to several significant strides in the development of cellulosic ethanol technology at the lab scale in recent months
4105851 construction of this pilot facility will allow our company to take the next step toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol
4105852 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4105853 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4105854 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4105855 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4105856 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4105857 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4105858 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4105859 goth and lollipops tea dresses and rompers for the mass market
4105860 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4105861 it seems i had violated ebays secondhand clothes policy by offering the tarts her names kylie i have since found out actual knickers up for auction previously
4105862 i can only now offer a photo of the said knickers and have adjusted the starting price accordingly

4105864 our research points to an ancient seasonal timing mechanism that survives in modern vertebrates some humans may retain remnants of this ancient seasonal timing mechanism which would explain why they experience sad
4105865 our next target is to understand exactly what tsh does when it gets into the brain to cause changes in behaviour and hormone secretion by defining these pathways we hope to increase our understanding not only of the control mechanisms in seasonal animals but also of sad
4105866 scalable and streamlined video deployment powered by tubemogul business wire wizzard media amex wze the world
4105867 wizzard media is very excited to partner with tubemogul to deliver a world class service for video producers that encompasses both downloadable and streaming video
4105868 we are opening our tools to all internet publishers and focusing on significantly extending the reach of the wizzard media platform for content creators
4105869 through collaboration with wizzard media mutual benefits will be realized for video publishers who want the power of tubemogul in a simplified workflow and a highly scalable model for increased views
4105870 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4105871 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
4105872 the democratic platform committee really reached out to moderate religious leaders from evangelical and catholic religious communities the resulting language on abortion is a real step forward that provides some sorely needed common ground around reducing the need for abortion
4105873 on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe v wade
4105874 cynical partisan profiteers will find fault with the tone of this plank but knowing the battle that went into the insertion of the new language i am very encouraged that democrats have widened their public support of mothers who choose life
4105875 in the end the interpretation of the platform lies in the hands of the candidate
4105876 affirming the good of childbirth and adoption does not justify or in any way soften the partys official support for an intrinsic evil
4105877 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration
4105878 get to work a manifesto for women of the world
4105879 cast the platform into purgatory and pick an antiabortion candidate for vice president the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position
4105880 i t is time to revive the moral argument for protecting a womans right to choose abortion is about the value of womens lives
4105881 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
4105882 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
4105883 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
4105884 creating a sort of double jeopardy for companies first having to run the fda approval maze then allowing a nationwide quilt of different laws and standards to second guess that approval
4105885 far from representing a radical departure in the law the courts reasoning upheld what had become a common opinion in the federal court system
4105886 reigel only applied to products in the strictest fda tranche known as premarket approval products which represent 1 to 2 of the overall medical device market
4105887 those who believe theyve been injured by medical devices can still sue for a poorly manufactured product or they can attempt to show that the fda didnt get all the necessary information when the device was approved
4105888 what mr waxman really wants to restore is the trial lawyer bingo that can net jackpot jury awards while wreaking havoc on national standards
4105889 democrats want tort lawyers and juries of lawmen to be the ultimate arbiters of new devices then they should do away with the fda entirely and go to an underwriters laboratory system that gets devices to patients more rapidly
4105890 they want it both ways agonizingly slow device approvals and open tort season after the fact
4105891 if congress really wants to improve the quality of medical products for consumers it would better spend its energy on reforming the bureaucratic morass that is the fda
4105892 this report shows that things dont seem to be getting better
4105893 and in fact in terms of the actual numbers they seem to be getting worse
4105894 while there may be young men on estates missing fathers who left them there are also children in middle britain whose parents become strangers in a culture of long working hours
4105895 in society the fetishisation of money and the growth of consumerism add new pressure
4105896 inequality plays its part as young men from poor backgrounds feel they have less to lose
4105897 why one boy asked me was i worried about his grades at school when he might not live long enough to get a job this is the world of get rich or die trying
4105898 the issue is one of self image in a warped world of gang culture carrying a weapon has come to be associated with being a man rather than being seen as a risk the knife confers respect
4105899 back in the day john mccain was the sort of politician who would stand first in line to call out this sort of swill
4105900 this is a lie and the guy telling it is a bad person
4105901 provide the public with a catholic evaluation of both entertainment features and documentaries from a moral and artistic perspective
4105902 luego me dijo que l ya no le interesaba y me invit a trabajar con ella
4105903 you dont go into politics if youre a shrinking violet the culture is blokey its very blokey and youve got to find your own way of dealing with that
4105904 clearly our society still struggles with visualising women in positions of power and authority
4105905 as rapid as change has been for perceptions of women and womens roles there is more change needed it sometimes seems impossible to win no matter what you do
4105906 eighty years ago when the first international womens day rally was held in sydney women called for equal pay for equal work not only do we still not have this but the gap has widened over the last few years
4105907 having women in leadership roles is important because our economy simply cant afford to turn away half the talent and half the ability of the australian community and we cannot in good conscience frustrate half the aspirations
4105908 we seem to send this quiet message to women come and join us but dont expect to rise to the top i think that has to change all positions should be based on merit and women should have equal opportunity
4105909 violence against women is a serious and pervasive human rights issue in australia it has a tremendous personal cost for affected women as well as social and economic costs for our community as a whole with as many as one in three australian women affected by domestic and family violence
4105910 globalisation and technology offer new ways of communicating with one another and influencing change i urge women to capitalise on these advances and use them to push for a better future where womens concerns are at centre stage locally and globally
4105911 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
4105912 we pray that it will not become a spectacle comparable to what took place in jena
4105913 is it an explosive situation that can create a backlash sure but thats not what i see
4105914 its not just blacks being abused its whites being abused too
4105915 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4105916 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4105917 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4105918 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4105919 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4105920 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4105921 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4105922 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4105923 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4105924 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4105925 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4105926 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4105927 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4105928 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4105929 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4105930 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4105931 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4105932 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4105933 id love to if i can find the right movie
4105934 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4105935 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4105936 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4105937 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4105938 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4105939 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4105940 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4105941 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4105943 ms toolkit the patients amp caregivers guide to multiple sclerosis
4105944 this positive review is an important milestone for bioms and our partner eli lilly and company and moves us one step closer to our goal of bringing this important therapy to multiple sclerosis patients
4105945 we are pleased by the results of the interim analysis and look forward to final efficacy and safety data from this trial next year
4105946 if successful this novel therapy administered only twice per year could help a large underserved population with late stage ms
4105947 were very encouraged with how weve been able to drive generic utilization for our members and consumers because we know that the use of generic medications is the most effective way to keep prescription drug spending manageable
4105948 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
4105949 the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions
4105950 people are turning their attention to this which is great
4105951 we need to elect labor friendly candidates that will support the employee free choice act
4105952 the middle class is dying out in this country and the only way we can turn things around and become stronger is to give all people the freedom to join and form a union
4105953 in an organizing campaign our local had to help workers form a union the majority almost 100 of workers signed cards in support of the union by the time we got to an election employers had been intimidating workers and were even calling workers into their offices one by one as the department of labor was setting up the voting booths the workers felt that employers had pretty much demoralized them and took away any real choice they had

4106173 other than that i cant think of many other things riesling wouldnt be plausible with it may not hit the bullseye every time but it will hit the target the arrow wont fly off into the woods

4106218 i had a fabulous time and met so many wonderful people
4106219 we have a research department that scours the internet newspapers and magazines for information
4106220 i went to wheatfields bakery in lawrence where we learned about various wheat flours head baker tom leonard demonstrated ancient methods of bread making including adding water to flour ground with a mortar and pestle to make flat breads
4106221 personally i never knew there were so many different types of wheat some of which are made into pastry others into bread or pasta i was amazed at the global importance of wheat and how much we export as a country
4106222 the way it has been edited and produced its really a heartwarming story i would definitely recommend it anyone who has any interest at all in wheat whether a producer or associated with the wheat industry should make plans to watch it

4106227 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4106228 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4106229 in sri lanka last year there were bombs going off while we were there
4106230 but you did not feel threatened by it because you have got the security detail and the army give you escorts id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4106231 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
4106232 inside me i think i would not have a problem id trust in them but then your family is saying you must be crackers and your girlfriend is saying i dont want you to go
4106233 it would be completely different if it was on moral grounds
4106234 matt mason has become an integral part of our squad since arriving in 2002
4106235 on the field he has had a tough 18 months but is now playing regularly with the first xi he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4106236 this appointment gives matt some certainty for the future whilst he can concentrate on extending his playing career i am delighted he has accepted the appointment
4106237 only 3 months ago i was wondering if i would ever play again so to be offered this combined role is more than i could ever have hoped for
4106238 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer and since returning to the first team i feel i proved that
4106239 coaching is something i am very passionate about and at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country
4106240 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
4106241 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
4106242 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
4106243 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
4106244 the rest of the guys one day specialists have been busy back home and they might be a bit rusty to begin with but theyve got three warm up games to get it right so hopefully well be alright for the start of the series
4106245 we are aware that some member boards want zimbabwes membership taken away but we are with zimbabwe on this
4106246 however we also understand the positions taken by the england and wales cricket board ecb and cricket south africa csa as they were prompted by the advice of the governments in those countries we do not blame them as they are bound by what their governments decide
4106247 but our position is very clear on the issue of full membership and we would like to totally support zimbabwe on that
4106248 we would love to see zimbabwe chucked out of the council but the chances of that happening are a little bit remote
4106249 new zealand is in a very small minority on the international cricket council which would like to see strong action taken on zimbabwe
4106250 the icc is meeting as we speak and we are just looking at the issues around all of that at the present time but basically we dont want to put our cricketers in a position where they might lose future tours
4106251 a stance that cricket south africa can be proud of
4106252 having played in zimbabwe in 1998 it was almost as though we arrived in a different country in 2004 scenes there reminded me quite strongly of pictures i had seen from eastern europe during the cold war
4106253 we are a full member of fifa and are currently participating in a world cup qualifying campaign we have a swimming program which has produced kirsty coventry a recent winner in the world championships
4106254 so it would be strange that the only sport to take action on so called current worries is cricket when all the other world sporting bodies have not taken that stance
4106255 i got to ride all the way to falmouth in that
4106256 bit wind blown he stood at the bow of the boat for most of the ride as you can see by his fierce hairdo
4106257 okay guys let me take a picture of you two together
4106258 she wins she wins leigh of bloggeritaville wins her 5 th
4106259 the effort is to have it be as energy efficient as possible
4106260 we came to the conclusion that putting something on town property was the best possible solution because its less expensive to build there
4106261 but things like hoses or this kind of equipment we buy ourselves
4106262 its very important that that part of the world keeps playing cricket
4106263 obviously those countries are struggling but if it doesnt happen i hope they do whatever they need to rectify the situation
4106264 i really cant say until i hear from aca and cricket australia
4106265 once again im going to have to look at that report and see what it says i cant commit either way at the moment
4106266 if we do go itll be on the basis of that all has been taken care of and that unease factor will hopefully be removed
4106267 theres obviously something going on although im only hearing it second hand
4106268 you are supposed to be in china covering the games replied wang wei executive vice president secretary general and spokesperson for bocog the beijing organizing committee
4106269 the chinese government lied through its teeth about human rights he said arent the i o c ashamed
4106270 we are proud of the fact that these games are progressing with spectacular sport in spectacular venues adding that they were also running smoothly
4106271 after 30 years of reform people have more freedom he said they were better off happy and optimistic he said some people were not happy he acknowledged but said that is the same anywhere
4106272 many people come here to pick into small details he said
4106273 if you had to share a goal in front of hundreds of leaders including al gore and the google founders wouldnt you feel some pressure to make it happen
4106274 haunt lancashire and come back and prove the manager and committee wrong
4106275 i would have liked to have had an opportunity to put my case forward
4106276 dominic corks dont come off the conveyer belt very few players can do what he does on a cricket field
4106277 to get the quality that he shows where are we going to get that from
4106278 people sitting up there drinking their gin and tonic dont have to deal with it
4106279 it would have been easier to go into a season with corky in your side but once again its an opportunity for someone to come in fill the boots and prove me wrong dominics been a fantastic servant to not only lancashire cricket but derbyshire and england
4106280 ill probably get in to a lot of trouble for what ive said but i just think that dominic cork is a quality performer
4106281 with the longer term development of the playing staff in mind and to allow the side to evolve
4106282 he was part of our brand hes part of what makes denver the west
4106283 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4106284 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4106285 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4106286 conveyed the new dates to the icc and they are fine with it
4106287 but i feel i can also still contribute on the field
4106288 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer
4106289 and since returning to the first team i feel ive proved that
4106290 at worcester i believe we have one of the strongest and most talented squads of fast bowlers in the country and the opportunity to work with the senior players and continue the development of the younger bowlers is one i am relishing
4106291 on the field he has had a tough 18 months
4106292 but he is now playing regularly with the 1st xi
4106293 he has certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4106294 its so exciting its me and brontes barratt last swim and what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4106295 for us to break the record by so far is amazing
4106296 its pretty amazing it was a great opportunity to swim with these girls and even better because were all from queensland
4106297 i havent been around too long and i didnt know how big a deal it was i just wanted to do the best i could it hasnt all sunk in yet
4106298 the australian team is amazing and im so happy to be a part of it
4106299 we went in knowing we had a really good chance i wasnt as nervous this time i was trying to enjoy the moment ive never led off a relay before
4106300 we both mutually agreed that being together is something that probably wont work during this month and decided to have a break
4106301 its my mothers birthday that day and i know what she would like for a present
4106302 he had prepared for this even better than i did he talked to our parents and they cried on the phone
4106303 they usually attack from the start no matter what they play very open football
4106304 but their biggest strength is their physical condition its a typical african team
4106305 but now its the knockout stage and anything can happen we cant make any mistakes we need to be cautious
4106306 its so exciting its me and brontes barratt last swim and what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4106307 for us to break the record by so far is amazing
4106308 its pretty amazing it was a great opportunity to swim with these girls and even better because were all from queensland
4106309 i havent been around too long and i didnt know how big a deal it was i just wanted to do the best i could it hasnt all sunk in yet
4106310 the australian team is amazing and im so happy to be a part of it
4106311 we went in knowing we had a really good chance i wasnt as nervous this time i was trying to enjoy the moment ive never led off a relay before
4106312 we both mutually agreed that being together is something that probably wont work during this month and decided to have a break
4106313 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the
4106314 das ist bislang mit gro em abstand meine konstanteste saison
4106315 klar wir haben m chtig mit dem sprit gezockt aber ein sieg ist immer noch ein sieg egal wie du das zustande bekommst und du bist keinen deut weniger stolz darauf
4106316 ich mag diese strecke denn es macht extrem viel spa dort ein rennen zu fahren
4106317 wir wissen jetzt was jeder von uns mag eine gute beziehung ist sehr wichtig ich hoffe wir k nnen zusammen irgendwann den titel holen
4106318 jetzt geht es auf die kurse auf denen wir gew hnlich gut aussehen wir brauchen im letzten saisondrittel eine noch h here frequenz an top 5 resultaten dann stehen wir richtig gut da vielleicht haben wir eine chance und vielleicht k nnen wir am wochenende einen lauf starten aber dazu brauchen wir auch ein wenig gl ck
4106319 its been a long while since ive played like that
4106320 to see my name on the leaderboard in the aftermath of whats happened is fantastic
4106321 i was very confident for the first time for a long while you know youve got to turn the corner sometime and that was today
4106322 i hadnt expected nick to pick me but if i just miss out after playing well for the next three weeks maybe he will
4106323 all of life is a journey which paths we take what we look back on and what we look forward to is up to us
4106324 im not skinny or fat kind of inbetween hope you like it i am five feet 6 inches tall i am white and have shiny dark brunette hair
4106325 if you dont have anything good to say dont say anything at all
4106326 think of yourself as a newspaper headline writer tasked with telling the whole story in just a few words to grab the readers attention
4106327 the shorter your email the more likely it is that it will be read and your request filled
4106328 what we have been seeing is cheerful people turning up at their hearings people wearing nice suits and ties and great big smiles on their faces we cant tell the difference between the suspects and the lawyers this has to stop we have able to tell who is suspected of corruption
4106329 were were not saying that this person is a criminal thats up to the court we just want to emphasise that they have a serious problem
4106330 corruption cases are far more serious so why arent they treated in the same way
4106331 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person

4106334 i said i think i have really hurt this person
4106335 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4106336 i dont believe in god i believe in al pacino and thats true if i ever get a phone call saying would you like to work with pacino i would go crazy
4106337 if anyone wants to win an oscar they can just work with me
4106338 matt mason has become an integral part of our squad since arriving in 2002 on the field he has a tough 18 months but is now playing regularly with the first xi
4106339 he certainly earned himself a new playing contract for 2009 but we want to look ahead so he will take on a dual role from october as a bowling coach
4106340 over the last two seasons he has been mentoring our younger players on an informal basis and it is clear he has a natural ability in this area
4106341 i am both proud and very excited to be given the opportunity to play and coach at the club next year
4106342 only three months ago i was wondering if i would ever play again so to be offered this combined role is more than i could ever have hoped for
4106343 as a player i believe i still have a lot to offer and since returning to the first team i feel i proved that

4106393 it enables us to consolidate operations increase efficiencies and grow our team of offshore consultants to keep up with growing market demands we certainly believe the new location will help us to grow our business and accommodate our expansion
4106394 miller hamilton has a strong and long history in the financial services sector representing financial institutions across the south this expansion for jones walker into additional states and the addition of capabilities to our banking practice offers a wider range of services and locations to our corporate and financial services client base one of jones walkers larger clients international shipholding corporation recently relocated to mobile and we can service them more efficiently with a local office
4106395 this combination made sense on many levels we expand the practices that we are able to offer to our clients and the culture between the two firms is a great fit together our firm will become one of the largest regional firms in the southern u s offering a full range of legal services the combination of the two firms fits well with both firms strategic business objectives and allows us to take advantage of a number of opportunities throughout the south
4106396 since we first opened our offices in mobile our lawyers have had the privilege and pleasure on many occasions of working with and alongside lawyers from the jones walker firm these experiences over the years i believe have bred in both firms a great deal of mutual respect and that among other things makes the prospect of this combination something that we look forward to with great excitement
4106397 i am pleased to report a strong quarter which yielded an operating income in spite of incurring restructuring charges during the quarter while software license revenues were down our other revenue sources improved in the quarter the significant increase was due to a 120 increase in professional service revenues other revenue sources also showed growth as transactional revenues increased by 38 due to the increase in utilization of our software solutions by current and new customers maintenance revenue was up 20 in the quarter
4106398 the companys return to profitability on an operating basis was assisted by the increase in revenues which created improved margins specifically our gross margin was 74 in the first quarter versus 69 one year ago in addition as weve streamlined our business and eliminated expenses as announced a few months ago our general and administrative expenses fell by 16 while we still have additional work to do in order to continue our growth this quarter marks an excellent start to recording future profits
4106399 as reported earlier we had a number of budgeted projects with new customers scheduled to start earlier in the year that were delayed due to industry and economic conditions this caused a significant decrease in revenues associated with professional services for the second quarter
4106400 in april we made appropriate adjustments to bring our cost structure in line with anticipated lower quarterly revenues these modifications allowed us to generate positive cash from operations during the second quarter
4106401 the lafayette child health clinic is open and ready to provide care but the fort greene clinic which was originally scheduled to open in july is now scheduled to reopen in october instead it is unfortunate that the fort greene clinic will not be functioning in time for the back to school rush for services
4106402 many had been closed in past years but there is renewed interest and commitment by the health amp hospitals corporation
4106403 it is most unfortunate to lose valuable primary care services in low income immigrant and communities of color which is why it is imperative that the fort greene clinic reopens as quickly as possible
4106404 in addition to our notable financial performance we have successfully resolved our legacy issue relating to the prior restatement of financials
4106405 in the field we continue to move forward on operational plans disclosed in our most recent form 10 ksb primarily the banks project and our new exploration project in northeast montana south flat lake

4106407 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
4106408 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
4106409 this was a despicable senseless and cowardly attack on people who were working to improve the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in afghanistan women and girls and children with disabilities who live in conflict zones
4106410 i join the international community in condemning this brutal act
4106411 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
4106412 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
4106413 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines of what president bush proposed
4106414 mccain has been especially supportive of his onetime rival appearing with bush at three events over the past two days in trying to prod democrats into negotiations to include private accounts in a plan to revamp social security
4106415 private savings accounts work they have been proven to work not only in america but all over the world and we ought to really strongly support it
4106416 privatizing social security be a priority for you going forward
4106417 without privatization i dont see how you can possibly over time make sure that young americans are able to receive social security benefits

4106422 dbms research reinforces that executive coaching can generate significant rewards within an organization
4106423 businesses that invest in human capital by effectively leveraging executive coaching to groom talent throughout the enterprise are witnessing a significant impact on both operational excellence and the bottom line
4106424 executive coaching has become an ideal talent management tool for increasing business performance and making a companys best people better
4106425 years ago organizations hired coaches only to support their top tier executives or to fix bad hires these days coaching is viewed as very positive and demonstrates an organizations commitment to the employees success in both current and future roles furthermore coaching is increasingly provided to mid level executives as well
4106426 executive coaching is clearly an important tool for organizations seeking to embrace the talent economy
4106427 talent management executives recognize that executive coaching can not only enhance situational learning but also lead to enhanced performance and a competitive advantage in the marketplace
4106428 it has been an amazing experience you really dont understand what asian fusion is until you come to singapore see the people see the culture see how it all intertwines together especially at the hawker centers i think ie and the people here did an exceptional job and ill definitely recommend the programme to anybody in the united states especially those people who really have a lot of experience in the food industry
4106429 ive never been to a hawker center before and the fact that you have such a big variety and people were just sitting around and enjoying the food and you have all these people cooking around us and the food just kept coming and we were trying all these different foods
4106430 the thing that seems so unique to me was the versatility of the ingredients the amazing depth of flavor the balance of sweet salty sour and spiciness the freshness and the vibrancy of the cuisine
4106431 situated at the cross roads of asia singapore cuisine is best described as the best of the chinese malay and indian food culture found in the cosmopolitan city state singapore food is characterized by a diverse mix of cultural traditions innovativeness in product development and dynamism of food influences and tastes consumer confidence is high as many of our manufacturers have attained the haccp standards for their quality and safety in food processing or preparation
4106432 i think singapore has a very unique story i would promote the culture the blend in the culture the seafood the freshness and vibrant presentation of the food the texture and the taste i would like to introduce to other chefs the ingredients of singapore to other chefs and let them incorporate the flavors of singapore into their cuisines
4106433 its been a fantastic experience it has been a roller coaster experience the flavors the people the portion of food and the culture here is just mind blowing the chefs were so innovative with singapore dishes such as the chili crab and the black pepper crab
4106434 i dont want to leave the island because i havent eaten enough although i had about six meals a day and each meal got better and better and better it all started out with ya kun when we had the toast with coconut jam and the cold butter and the hawker market i could just stay here all night and just go from stand to stand and eat and eat and eat i love the john bread roti john which is like french toast but only better the best part was when jeff anderson bought the bee hoon satay noodle which was a little spicy and very good
4106435 were glad to be able to show our thanks to the reseller community but the technology show is about more than that

4106447 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
4106448 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
4106449 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
4106450 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
4106451 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue
4106452 the ability is in the dressing room to win the ashes i dont think anyone would doubt that

4106455 we were finding it more and more difficult to manage our teaching schedule via e mail especially as we grew our staff to meet the demand to accommodate more and more lessons we decided to look at sms as an alternative especially as all our staff had cellphones we did some market research and selected bulksms com as their messaging services met our requirements to better manage staff and support our online english training business model

4106473 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4106474 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4106475 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4106476 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4106477 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4106478 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between

4106480 sen john mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits serious consideration despite his support for abortion rights
4106481 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him
4106482 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4106483 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4106484 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4106485 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4106486 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
4106487 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
4106488 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement

4106763 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

4106792 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4106793 ended the conversation without entertaining any follow up questions as to whether he would be crossing party lines to endorse obama
4106794 its not true hes not going to either convention and i think perhaps some people inferred from the fact that colin powell is not going to the republican convention that he was going to choose the democrat what general powell is telling friends is that he wants to evaluate both candidates see whom they choose to be their running mates and then make a decision so no endorsement of barack obama hes not ruling it out but he wants to see where both of the candidates stand on the issues and on their choice of running mates
4106795 i think that would be very big i think that first hes not primarily seen as a black person so i dont think its a racial thing hes seen as someone with tremendous expertise in foreign policy and the responsible right as opposed to the neo con id be very surprised if he endorsed obama but it would be very significant
4106796 there is a certain expectation you know among people who are following this thing that colin powell probably supports barack obama you know whether hes going to come out and make a show of it nobodys quite sure i wouldnt be surprised if theres a statement sometime in september or october that might be the level were looking at here
4106797 working off a presumed short list of three and then cutting that by two we may now be able to predict that senator barack obamas running mate will be senator joe biden of delaware obamas presidential campaign announced today that the keynote speaker at the democratic national convention will be the former governor of virginia mark warner warners rising star might actually dim the vp chances for virginias current governor tim kaine on this simple theory warner speaks on tuesday night the vice presidential candidate makes his acceptance speech on wednesday night it is unlikely that out of the universe of possible speakers two virginia governors would be scheduled for major speeches on successive convention nights
4106798 further if obama wants the theme for wednesday night national security to dovetail with his vice presidential pick it is biden since he has far more heft in that department against his other supposed short listers governor kaine and indiana senator evan bayh
4106799 well the logic is all there i do think what youre looking at at this point is bayh or biden and i do think that joe biden is sort of a hot commodity hes the name that has been kicking around in obama world for some time i sort of dismissed it for a while joe biden has a reputation for shooting from the lip a little too much to be a vice president but it continues to crop up which makes me think hes really in the running here one other quick thing about biden here he is known for speaking about anything and everything whenever asked he has been pretty quiet lately which leads to some suspicion
4106800 i like senator lieberman a great deal i admire him a lot i think hed be a great secretary of state i think he would be terrific as an attorney general but i think the idea of him being the republican vice presidential nominee would split the convention would probably mean that bob barr would get about 15 percent of the vote i think that traditional values right to life conservatives would walk out of the convention in a way that would be unmanageable by the mccain people
4106801 he presented himself as this family man who was devoted to his ill wife his little children his older daughter so the hypocrisy of it i try not to judge peoples personal lives because you never know whats going on but in this case he so presented himself as someone who he was not plus when your wifes going through cancer i mean gee

4106817 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he
4106818 this man will continue to kill until hes caught no woman is safe
4106819 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble

4106889 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children

4106906 the majority of farmers visiting our stands at shows dread the imposition of what they see as an unworkable and totally unfair new tax on their already inadequate incomes
4106907 it is estimated that eid will knock about 40 off a farmers income overnight
4106908 this is a significant percentage of what is already a pitifully low figure the welsh assembly forecasts livestock farm incomes at around 8500 a drop of 24 on last year
4106909 this eu regulation has the potential to cripple what is one of the most efficient sheep producing areas in the world

4106911 we need to see changes to make the regulation workable or we risk facing an exodus of producers from the sheep industry

4106931 it was exciting to say the least it was right after the streakers came out on the field it was hectic and a crazy inning and it was fun and exciting
4106932 it has been unreal we face a schools ace every night you can see so many talented players guys that will be in the big leagues some day it is tough but you are seeing the best talent around
4106933 it does not really mean that much just a good couple of weeks baseball is humbling because right now i am not hitting the ball too well it has proven a lot to me personally because i feel like i belonged here i told the coaches at the beginning of the year if i was not able to play in the cape i was not going to play summer ball since day one i felt like i been capable of playing up here and i kept going and coach holbrook and forbes worked hard for me and they got me a spot up here at harwich
4106934 it was awesome we got to talk with jonathan papelbon and go on the field during batting practice and go wherever we wanted to go it was cool it was an awesome place and being able to see mannys ramirez last game as a red sox was pretty cool it is a nice park
4106935 the acc guys on our team were talking about that hopefully boston college will be in it so there will be some fan support kind of like florida state had in jacksonville we are excited i hope we are one of the top eight teams next year i would expect us to be
4106936 it is a clean slate timmy has had the job at unc since he got there his freshman year we will all have to work really hard this fall will have a lot to do about it mike mckee is coming back and two freshmen that are going to come in and challenge mckee and i for some playing time we have to keep improving and working on our game in order to get on the field
4106937 not really they want me to just keep working on my overall game and keep improving
4106938 we did not have a lot of people steal on us last year i know that we threw a lot of guys out part of that is that coach fox is very aggressive throwing behind the runners i have probably been more aggressive this summer i wanted to showcase the tools a little bit working on picking more guys off up here it has been working more often than it has not it helps to control the other team it also keeps the pitcher comfortable by not having to work so hard at keeping him close at first
4106939 i have not had an opportunity to talk with him personally but we have text messaged back and forth the coaches were supposed to come up all the coaches but they had some plane difficulty with the weather they were coming up to watch harwich play the chatham guys that would have been five teammates playing in that game
4106940 it has been really fun me and patrick johnson were talking about it since he is also on harwich i have caught the last two games against chatham and whenever kyle seager is hitting we would kid each other we always messing around we are really good friends he has been getting some knocks off of us i need to figure out a way to get him out
4106941 it was hard for the first week getting used to all the guys i spent the first week catching bullpens and getting used to the guys stuff once you get a relationship with the pitcher on the field they start to trust you a little more i try to get the pitchers able to trust me and seeing what he likes

4107296 im amazed that so many athletes are wearing a fabric i tested in a laboratory in hampton virginia
4107297 what we look at are concepts for reducing drag on otherwise smooth surfaces this is more directed toward fundamental physics the interactions between the flow and the surface
4107298 we evaluated the surface roughness effects of nearly 60 fabrics or patterns in one of our small low speed wind tunnels
4107299 we were assessing which fabrics and weaves had the lowest drag the tests have generally shown the smoother the fabric the lower the drag
4107300 the fabric comes in the form of fabric tubes a small diameter fabric tube
4107301 we pull that over our smooth flat model which is an aluminum plate underneath we prepare the edges so theyre straight and square with no protruding corners or edges to interfere with the drag on the surface
4107302 there was simply no clinical evidence for any of it
4107303 i thought the issue was settled though i know a lot of people will never believe that

4107345 the great warming climate change and the rise and fall of civilizations
4107346 when i began writing the book i expected to focus on europe
4107347 but as i looked further afield i realized that for a lot of the world the medieval warm period meant savage issues related to drought with so much of the world currently suffering from the effects of drought this struck me as a neglected problem
4107348 if you look at the warm centuries with a global perspective the wide incidence of drought is truly striking and offers a sobering message about tomorrows world prolonged aridity was widespread in medieval times and killed enormous numbers of people evidence is mounting that drought is the silent and insidious killer associated with global warming

4107376 but there is no excuse for what the mccain campaign is doing on the putting america first front there is no way to balance it or explain it other than as evidence of a severe character defect on the part of the candidate who allows it to be used there is a straight up argument to be had in this election mcain has a vastly different view from obama about foreign policy taxation health care government action you name it he has lots of experience it is always shocking to remember that this time four years ago barack obama was still in the illinois state legislature apparently though mccain isnt confident that conservative policies and personal experience can win given the ruinous state of the nation after eight years of bush so he has made a fateful decision he has personally impugned obamas patriotism and allows his surrogates to continue to do that by doing so he has allied himself with those who smeared him his wife his daughter bridget in 2000 those tactics won george bush a primary and a nomination but they proved a form of slow acting spiritual poison rotting the core of the bush presidency well see if the public decides to acquiesce in sleaze in 2008 and what sort of presidency what sort of country that will produce

4107381 the discovery that john mccains remarks on georgia were derived from wikipedia to put it politely is disturbing and even depressing
4107382 i am very disturbed that a group of so called experts challenged the notion of early detection
4107383 have gotten so one sided that people are unwilling to listen
4107384 the other 1 1 2 percent have their lives extended by 200 days
4107385 and were doing things that have a potential for harm
4107386 theyve made us scared of the disease and its understandable that women want to believe that theres something they can do
4107387 i feel the confusion stems from the fact that they sold women in their 40s on mammography before there was any evidence

4107392 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
4107393 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4107394 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4107395 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4107396 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4107397 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4107398 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4107399 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4107401 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4107402 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4107403 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4107404 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4107405 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4107406 how to be green many people have asked us this important question its really very simple and requires no expert knowledge or complex skills heres the answer consume less share more enjoy life

4107408 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4107409 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4107422 the point is not to publish another obama book the point is to change the political conversation similar to what we did when we published lakoff and wolf a president obama holds great promise for this country but he needs to be challenged to step up and risk a bold progressive agenda the economic situation is dire if he tries to play safe hes finished bob kuttner has brilliantly outlined the steps he needs to take to be that transformative leader now its up to him and to us to make sure he takes up that challenge
4107423 we had initially decided to pre write the book wait to see who won and then either publish in january or have a big bonfire
4107424 but margo baldwin at chelsea green decided to take an even bigger risk to get the book out by labor day on the assumption that obama will be the next president talk about the audacity of hope
4107425 once we aimed for labor day we then wondered what it would take to get it out by the democratic convention and into the hands of the fifteen to twenty thousand convention goers who are the books natural audience
4107426 this election is too important to wait around for traditional publishing lead times the book needs to come out now if its to have a major impact the technology is available to have books on the day the book files are sent off to the printer and thats what were doing and amazon has been an amazing partner in this effort
4107427 robert kuttner has incisively captured the political moment underscored by the deepening economic crisis lucidly and passionately he lays out the hurdles facing an obama presidency and challenges him to seize the moment and achieve greatness by redeeming the promise of america
4107428 bob kuttner hits the high notes with artful precision lifting expectations and articulating the steps that can make barack obama a great president while setting forth a strong and highly readable call for comprehensive and essential economic change
4107429 a manifesto forceful but fair by a leading political economist who lays out a bold but solid program if obama is elected as current as the mornings newspaper this book should be read by all activists especially barack obama
4107430 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4107431 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4107432 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4107433 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4107436 seeing apes in entertainment may lead people to believe that conservation is not an issue for them
4107437 if that diminishes concern for conservation then thats a problem
4107438 the fact that steve martins place which is one of the major players in the business is taken out of hollywood now thats a major coup
4107439 there actually is a shot to get all orangutans out of the entertainment industry
4107440 luckily we came along at a time when the martins were open to the notion of change and the great ape trust was a perfect solution
4107441 this was as close to win win as you can get
4107442 there are people in the entertainment industry that probably realize that cooperation is the way to go
4107443 this lack of awareness generally translates into a lack of concern and caring
4107444 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4107445 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages

4107447 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4107448 to have a piece of his gold medal with you and with every person on our team is just inspirational
4107449 when we heard him talk at our breakfast after the trials it was awe inspiring he just made you feel like you were part of it with him even though it was so long ago
4107450 it was the last connection to that moment it just connected the team loved it
4107451 to get that from him hes such an idol in canadians swimming
4107452 i think it really means a lot to the whole team and it brought us together
4107453 i couldnt believe he did that cutting up the towel
4107454 everyone was really surprised when he did that it was fantastic
4107455 its moved around the world with me out of all the stuff i had somehow this damn old towel just kept coming with me
4107456 it giving it to the swim team seemed like the right thing to do it was a symbolic thing i wished it had turned into a medal
4107457 if i want to remember the moment i have this beautiful gold thing
4107458 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4107459 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4107460 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4107461 i just dont want it to be hillary clinton cause i mean i would never win if i made a neon pantsuit

4107471 with the number of hispanic internet users in the u s expected to rise to nearly 21 million by 2010 its clear that marketers have a tremendous opportunity to grow their consumer base by successfully targeting hispanics online
4107472 the problem is most marketers have questioned if and how online venues are an effective channel for communicating with hispanics in conducting this research we set out to help our clients understand if and how they can use online communities to successfully engage members of this important consumer segment and what differences within this broad and diverse population should be considered in formulating a community strategy our findings offer valuable insight not only for businesses evaluating online communities but also for marketers considering other online channels such as social networks as a strategy for engaging hispanics online

4107541 set our sights on hosting an event that would not only be informative fun and conducive to networking but one that would not require attendees to leave their offices during normal u s trading hours the solution is raise the bar a charitable wine tasting event where institutional investors and asset managers come together for an evening of fun facts finance and philanthropy

4107543 hartstikke mooi toch lekker dicht bij het centrum je kunt snel even een terrasje pakken
4107544 je kunt dit gebied beschouwen als n van de eerste industriegebieden van assen door die vaart kreeg de stad een verbinding met meppel de zuiderzee en amsterdam al snel kwamen hier ook pakhuizen om opslag mogelijk te maken assen heeft zelfs een eigen drenthse stoombootmaatschappij gehad
4107545 assen werd verlost van zijn scheepvaart dat paste toen in de geest van de tijd er was geen aandacht meer voor de haven en de vaarwegen dat gebeurde overigens niet alleen in assen maar ook in anderen steden de zeven bruggen in assen moesten plaatsmaken voor dammen de kolk waar de schepen konden draaien werd gedempt en daar kwam een groot parkeerterrein voor in de plaats

4107559 its too early to say an exact date for when we can expect richard back but hell miss the start of the season
4107560 however this is a relatively minor procedure so he wont be sidelined for too long
4107561 well assess his situation closely and will be in a better position to predict his return in a couple of weeks
4107562 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team it showed us in no uncertain terms that we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
4107563 you can never underestimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
4107564 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident that we wont be taking anything for granted
4107565 i certainly dont want to be losing one of my best players

4107568 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about
4107569 the president should come from a technology background and understand technology at a high level
4107570 it would be good if the person at the helm of the country had an appreciation of the changes taking place as we speak
4107571 is it more complex than a nuclear power plant hardly
4107572 anything to do with technology becomes a distraction at some level
4107573 i dont think were going to find him on facebook or chatrooms
4107574 a mechanical problem is not always solved by a mechanical widget
4107575 his desire to deal with the problem will be motivated by his experience with the box
4107576 the fact that they maintain and secure the it infrastructure is ten times more important than anything you do
4107577 its not so much the use of it but theres a level of familiarity theres a sense of what it means for this amount of information about peoples interconnections to be out there
4107578 if the president himself is not tech savvy there will be someone who will be in effect the person calling the shots on these issues of where technology meets public policy and that i think would be pretty scary

4107594 ich bin sehr berrascht das programm spielte wie ein mensch
4107595 der gr te fortschritt besteht darin dass das pocket fritz 3 nicht so materialistisch ist wie die meisten maschinen besonders in der endspieltechnik hat die neue version zugelegt im axel bachmann
4107596 ich habe versucht taktische varianten zu vermeiden und das programm strategisch zu bek mpfen und vielleicht einen k nigsangriff zu entwickeln der jenseits des rechenhorizonts liegt doch das programm schien meine pl ne genau zu verstehen und verteidigte sich aufmerksam und menschlich
4107597 ich habe einfach ganz entspannt meine variante gespielt es ist ja keine schande gegen ein schachprogramm zu verlieren mir hat gefallen dass dieses programm nicht so materialistisch ist wie die meisten maschinen ich habe eine figur f r drei bauern geopfert und war berrascht wie pr zise pocket fritz die position mit ungleichem material behandelt hat die neue version hat sich erheblich verbessert
4107598 mir ist in meiner partie gegen die maschine aufgefallen dass das programm und ich bei der bewertung der jeweiligen stelllungen eigentlich immer zum gleichen ergebnis kamen
4107599 w hrend der partie habe ich ordentlich geschwitzt und hatte m he ausgleich zu erreichen 11
4107600 der stil von pocket fritz 3 unterscheidet sich sehr von anderen programmen die ich kenne ich war von seinen entscheidungen sehr beeindruckt
4107601 die neue version spielt besser als ihr vorg nger im letzten jahr
4107602 besonders die strategischen f higkeiten und die endspieltechnik scheint sich verbessert zu haben ich analysiere normalerweise mit fritz und rybka aber die kleine maschine hier wirkt im strategischen bereich st rker und macht keine strategischen fehler
4107603 ich wurde in der ukraine geboren studierte dort informatik beendete aber mein studium in deutschland nun wohne ich in trier der ltesten deutschen stadt wo auch karl marx gelebt hat seit vier jahren arbeite ich f r chessbase war an der entwicklung von pocket fritz 3 beteiligt und bin nun hier um das neue programm bei seinem ersten gro en auftritt zu bedienen

4107605 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4107606 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4107607 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4107608 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

4107623 wenn wir das in deutschland vorhandene batterien und energiemanagement know how st rker b ndeln w rden k nnten wir hnlich wie schon heute in der solartechnik auch in bereich der akkumulatoren mittelfristig durchaus eine internationale spitzenstellung einnehmen das daf r n tige technische wissen ist schon heute vorhanden
4107624 in den vergangenen acht jahren hat sich sowohl bei den zellen und akku technologien als auch im bereich der leistungselektronik unglaublich viel bewegt lithium ionen akkus haben inzwischen eine energie und leistungsdichte erreicht die noch vor nicht allzu langer zeit als undenkbar galt und auch das energiemanagement l sst sich heute viel genauer steuern insofern sind wir sehr zuversichtlich dass unser gemeinsames projekt am ende zu konkreten wirtschaftlich nutzbaren ergebnissen f hren wird
4107625 wir gehen davon aus das leistungsf higere energiespeicher in kombination mit einem effizienten energiemanagementsystem den anwendungsbereich von elektrostaplern in der industrie deutlich erweitern werden

4107627 das deutsche klimarechenzentrum hat weltweit unterschiedliche szenarien des k nftigen klimas berechnet dieses globale verst ndnis der ver nderungen im 21 jahrhundert hilft jedoch den menschen in den betroffenen regionen westafrikas wenig sich auf die damit verbundenen herausforderungen vorzubereiten
4107628 aus diesen forschungsergebnissen wollen wir m glichkeiten einer angepassten pflanzenproduktion f r mensch und tier ableiten und damit die bev lkerung speziell die kleinbauern in westafrika bei ihren anpassungsbestrebungen unterst tzen
4107629 der computerbasierte kurs war urspr nglich f r die wiederholung des in unseren pr senzseminaren gelernten gedacht

4107631 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
4107632 they come in and say we were going to get married anyway but right now we really need the insurance
4107633 there may be an unplanned pregnancy or there is an illness or theyve lost their job and cant get insurance
4107634 im running out of family members to pay for it
4107635 i felt the only way i could get around this was to marry him
4107636 now these men can get back to doing the work they love
4107637 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
4107638 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check
4107639 the people behind this effort want to make south dakota the first step in a long term campaign to mount a legal challenge to roe vs wade
4107640 it seems desperate to me that they would hold a press conference in washington d c
4107641 people in south dakota dont like it if they think someone nationally is trying to tell them what to do
4107642 it is a cynical effort i believe by anti choice groups to simply use the state of south dakota and the voters of south dakota to do their ultimate goal
4107643 which is to challenge the fundamental right of women in this country that supported the right decision to make these personal decisions
4107644 the first ballot measure was designed for south dakota and south dakota only
4107645 this time it is designed to go to the supreme court
4107646 terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
4107647 statistical information that were starting to hear from countries like zimbabwe and even some from south africa really are sic affirming the effectiveness of what we believe not just true love waits but the sexual abstinence movement in general
4107648 in africa when a student makes that decision its a life and death decision and they recognize that and then secondly theyre living out that decision that commitment to sexual abstinence
4107649 they recognize the impact thats going to have on future generations of their community or tribe or country
4107650 the balance sheet constraint issue is ruling over all others big syndications might be difficult from here on for the rest of the year
4107651 there is an inexorable rise in pricing as more and more banks are affected by the credit crunch there is less liquidity around and banks are being far more selective in the deals that they will support it just means that pricing is going up

4107679 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
4107680 the idea is to change these dendritic cells so that instead of being aggressive they return to their normal state
4107681 the presumption is that they will stay this way unless the same trigger which is thought to cause the problem in the first place is encountered again

4107688 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4107689 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4107690 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4107691 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4107772 the bottom line is that inflation has spiked horribly which now makes those benchmarks difficult to beat and it could possibly get worse before it gets better also important to consider is that cash on a real basis is barely beating inflation either with inflation rising faster than interest rates
4107773 not on a spot basis and that the kind of market volatility that were now seeing is not necessarily beyond what has been anticipated by the portfolio managers of those funds
4107774 even high dividend yield equity funds some of which are enjoying particularly high dividend yields at present are struggling to keep up with after tax returns of money market funds

4107803 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4107847 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4107848 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4107864 we are looking for gulfstream sales growth of 13 5 percent in 2008 which should decelerate to just under 10 percent next year when we believe gulfstream will reach its maximum capacity to build large aircraft before the arrival of the g650
4107865 in 2010 we expect growth to drop to 2 percent as large aircraft deliveries remain flat and small and medium deliveries decline by a moderate 11 percent

4107876 the georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets so first they turned it to ruins with a grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city there was heavy fighting in the streets i think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town

4107888 ive long argued that the value of facebook is in the fact that it has convinced millions to share real information about themselves versus the fake information you see on myspace and many other social networks but the thing is it seems facebook users want to share real information along the lines of glittery photos it wouldnt surprise me if facebook sees a sustained protest from millions of users who dont care about publishing in the first place who just want to decorate their profiles to show off to their friends
4107889 theyve improved the control you have over your profile and privacy who can see what of your content and so on that is always an area close to my heart as i dont like to share personal info with my business network and vice versa and they really start to elevate the most recent content so its easier to keep up with friends who update their pages more frequently i like the refreshed look and feel its definitely easier to navigate but i think they also sneaked in more ad space i didnt notice these big ads before on my profile pages
4107890 no likie at first i thought it hadnt finished loading when in fact it had my reaction was really and when i reverted back i felt better
4107891 the new facebook does a good job at separating out the content of what you really want
4107892 one thing you will see is a lot of people hating it well remember how many people hated mini feed now that is the most popular feature so we are very quick to hate on something when we get familiar with it
4107893 ive been slowing my facebook activities and this was the trigger for me to almost totally abandon facebook i dont like the design at all too spread out too confusing
4107894 i pretty much stick to facebook on my blackberry and im really happy with the clutter free bb app so the redesign kinda missed me
4107895 overall the site is still very much the same in my opinion it just takes a couple days to figure out where your navigation went
4107896 i know im still viewing and taking screenshots for presentations with the old view whereas when myspace redesigned their layout i leaped over immediately
4107897 to me the redesign seems to position facebook more and more as a hub for all your feeds and widgets like netvibes rather than a social site
4107898 im not sure i like that move groups is one of the only places that i think brands can be decently effective on the site today and i think the redesign has buried that service even more ive never been a big fan of traditional banner ads on facebook i guess the voting aspect makes it interesting socially but where can a good brand go to get a little decent community action going
4107899 as someone whos signed up for every app that would have me i have to say that i like the tabs for separating things out that said id like a bit more customization as far as being able to put something specific on my front page

4107902 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4107903 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4107904 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4107905 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4107906 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4107910 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4107911 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4107912 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4107913 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4107915 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4107917 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

4107919 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4107920 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4107921 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4107922 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4107923 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4107924 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4107925 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4107926 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4107927 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4107928 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4107929 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4107930 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4107931 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4107932 its a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll
4107933 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4107934 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4107935 we had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay
4107936 teaching our children how to appreciate the lords good earth
4107937 to help our parishioners find ways to save their homes rather than to lose them
4107938 its a historic opportunity to know that an african american is running as a presumptive nominee of the democratic party
4107939 but we were in prayer for both sen obama his family and sen mccain and his family
4107940 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4107941 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4107942 i dont get star struck or awe struck i keep saying that i want us to be recognised for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4107943 otherwise the press will do the quaint story of little old albion going off to play liverpool or manchester united as lambs to the slaughter
4107944 it is important that we change the perception and show that thats not the case that we have got every chance of winning the games were going into and it isnt a question of just going and enjoying the day
4107945 we have to earn that right with performances on the pitch and if that doesnt happen this year we will get portrayed as a little club just enjoying their season in the premiership but getting back to reality next year
4107946 from my perspective weve got to make sure that in every single minute of every game the supporters the players and everyone else involved with the club have to make sure that they arent just little old albion enjoying the season
4107947 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4107948 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4107949 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4107950 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4107951 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4107952 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4107953 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4107954 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4107955 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4107956 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4107957 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4107958 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4107959 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4107960 i know pepe well from when he was a trainee at barcelona he has grown into an incredibly confident goalkeeper and i think he is in for a fantastic season now you will see that i have two other liverpool players in my team so that should give you some indication of my belief in that team for this season
4107961 he is very different from hutton but i think equally valuable to the team of course ashley cole is the best left back in english football but bale shows the same instincts and has a brilliant left foot i just hope he stays free of injury
4107962 ricardo is one of the best centre backs in the world so of course he must be in my team he was so important to me at porto and again at chelsea playing for chelsea made him tougher and he became more stable and more reliable at the back
4107963 william is another one i know well and i was obviously very disappointed when he moved from chelsea to arsenal
4107964 many people spoke about his temperament last season because of a couple of incidents when results didnt go his way but for me it is a temperament i want in my side it means he is a winner and when he is not winning he gets upset
4107965 again i wish lassana had never left chelsea but he is a young man who is so incredibly ambitious that not only did he leave chelsea to make his name he then had the confidence to say goodbye to arsenal too this will be a big season for him and i expect him to become a big player with the france team very soon too
4107966 of course everybody knows i wanted gerrard at chelsea why wouldnt i he has been so strong for liverpool for so many years and he will continue to be this year there is no frank lampard in my fantasy team but that is certainly not because i think the two of them cannot play together
4107967 essien is much more than the powerhouse than a lot of people think he is they dont see how good he is with the ball and tactically he is first rate always thinking faster than his opponents and when he does score believe me it can be spectacular
4107968 pedersen is destined for the very top i respect blackburn as a club but i think pedersen will be playing for a top team in england very soon
4107969 i always say that a great team must have a great goalkeeper and a great striker my team like liverpool has just that torres is simply a match winner and now a european championship winner too i am expecting at least 20 goals from him
4107970 he wants to make sure of his place in the england team and scoring 20 goals for portsmouth this season will help
4107971 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4107972 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4107973 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4107974 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4107975 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4107976 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4107977 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4107978 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4107979 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4107980 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4107981 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4107982 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4107983 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4107984 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4107985 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4107986 the chances of a violent shooting occurring in a church are remote but it can and has happened
4107987 if this program helps save a life or prevent a shooting it will be worth it
4107988 im very concerned about the countys liability but im equally concerned about the churchs liability
4107989 any time we have a large gathering of citizens whether it be a church or a block party or a fireworks demonstration or a parade the potential is there for a lot of people to be injured
4107990 a tremendous loss to his reputation not only in the but in latin american countries where he was well known and respected
4107991 the allegations in mr arangos lawsuit are very general in nature and it is extremely early in the litigation process but we believe this suit is totally without merit and that the bgct has no liability in the matter
4107992 made certain statements of purported fact that the plaintiff had stolen and or improperly used defendant bgct funds that he had allegedly lied about the number of churches he had formed and that he had allegedly stolen money from the defendants
4107993 these false and malicious statements have been and continue to be detrimental to plaintiffs reputation credibility and integrity as plaintiff had a history of being an honest individual
4107994 in his business trade occupation and or profession and in his ability to obtain future employment
4107995 it is unusual for australian baptists to join with leaders of other religions in expressions of co belligerence but on climate change action this has been possible
4107996 we believe that time is running out for the many communities across the globe who are already suffering from the devastating effects of climate change including in the small island nations and low lying areas of the pacific region
4107997 we recognize that livelihoods communities and cultures in the pacific are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events and sea level rise foreshadowing what is to come if concerted action is not taken the future impact of unabated climate change on families communities and all other life will be significant
4107998 work for ecologically responsible and sustainable living in our faith communities listen to support and advocate for our partners in the pacific and in other communities worldwide which are already affected by climate change and advocate towards all sectors of society to intensify cooperation in response to climate change
4107999 our failure as baptists to engage with these issues in an adequate and timely manner
4108000 in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
4108001 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god the name was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
4108002 churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
4108003 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4108004 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4108010 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
4108011 bigger picture we maintain that wave y the third wave in a 3 wave advance from 95 72 is underway from 103 76 and will end in the 113 25 116 65 zone fibo levels from the 124 13 95 72 drop and give way to a long term reversal the rally from 103 76 is probably the first zigzag in a double zigzag as wave y so expectations are for a drop to reach the 38 2 of 103 76 110 40 107 86
4108012 even if this is not the top end of the advance from 9055 then we would still expect a deeper decline from current levels
4108013 short term channel support should lead to a larger advance from near current price
4108014 i think the bmw will be a good car in scotland but there is the issue of damage as it is a circuit that is notorious for it
4108015 its a long way from home for us and we missed the round last year because we had so much damage following brands hatch with the seats that we couldnt get them repaired and in the trucks in tiem for the journey
4108016 with the issue of damage there is a bit of a worry as we have round over the weekend and then the drive back on monday and on tuesday well pull the cars out of the trucks hoping there isnt too much damage as there is soon afterwards with a bank holiday in between which makes it harder to get parts

4108055 what they understand is action the question now is whether the u s and other western nations will be willing to take serious action against this outrageous russian aggression
4108056 it is also important to give georgia the wherewithal to defend itself
4108057 if russia doesnt call off its offensive right away the pentagon should rush deliveries of javelins and stingers to georgia
4108058 on iran for instance russia has been more hindrance than help it has helped iran to develop its nuclear program and it has been selling iran high tech surface to air missiles russia has gone along grudgingly with weak sanctions at the un but along with china it has blocked more robust action if russia delivers important aid in the war on terrorism or other areas im not aware of it increasingly the russians have adopted a confrontational tone with the west and they have backed it up with bullying of our allies the bush administration and other western governments have tried their best to get along with russia that has been interpreted by putin not as a sign of goodwill but as a sign of weakness it is time to send a different message by making clear that russia has crossed a red line in georgia

4108081 should church members violate these rules they will be subject to the disciplinary actions of the chinese government
4108082 pastors were forced to sign a written agreement that they would not participate in religious services while the olympic games are taking place in china
4108083 the document drafted by chinese government officials specifies that the house churches in china refrain from organizing and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organizations and groups that have a purpose
4108084 the discovery of this document provides further evidence of the prcs hypocrisy towards creating a harmonious society marked by religious freedom and rule of law
4108085 the fact the document was issued while the worlds focus is on china is a blatant challenge to the international community and an apathetic stance toward seeking to correct human rights violations
4108086 if china is seeking to put on the mantle of a world superpower it must first acknowledge the unalienable rights of its own people caa calls on the international community and those concerned to voice their complaint to the relevant chinese government authorities

4108097 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india

4108099 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4108100 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4108101 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step

4108115 according to tyson fully 80 percent of the unions 1 000 members agreed to the new holiday arrangement if a workforce with a huge muslim contingent wants to make a deal with management to have their biggest religious holiday off who cares and why are there rumblings about boycotting tyson when its the union thats driving this what am i missing is there an anti eid exception to freedom of contract
4108116 what makes tyson think they have the right to replace our american holidays by substituting a religious muslim holiday in its place this nation was founded by christians and we are still the majority not the muslims

4108129 i think chellsie memmel certainly is a very tough athlete
4108130 certainly gymnasts put a lot of emphasis on landing and thats going to be very difficult with an ankle because it throws off your balance sense as well as your strength

4108136 lightscribe duplicators offer margins and profits exceeding those of normal tower dvd and cd duplicators
4108137 the introduction out our lightscribe duplicators really does represent a turning point in the way people approach disc publishing
4108138 traditionally if a tower duplicator customer wished to produce a disc that is both copied and labelled they would have to purchase a separate printer

4108157 2008 ist ein sonniges jahr f r die deutsche photovoltaikbranche mit aller voraussicht nach wird der markt erneut im zweistelligen prozentbereich wachsen
4108158 um die weltweit rasant steigende solarenergie nachfrage zu befriedigen und deutschlands technologief hrerschaft zu behaupten will die deutsche solarwirtschaft bis 2010 ber sieben milliarden euro in den ausbau modernster solarfabriken sowie in forschung und entwicklung investieren
4108159 die positive entwicklung im siliziumgesch ft best tigt unser gesch ftsmodell und unsere strategie uns in weiteren stufen der solaren wertsch pfungskette zu etablieren
4108160 die konjunktur ist in den letzten wochen regelrecht eingebrochen und das weltweit so gibt es zum jetzigen zeitpunkt wenige berzeugende faktoren die eine weitere verschlechterung in den n chsten monaten aufhalten k nnen man sollte sich derzeit darauf einstellen dass es auch in europa zumindest in einigen staaten eine rezession geben k nnte die signale sprechen momentan eher daf r als dagegen
4108161 wegen des schlechten konjunktursausblicks wird sich das wachstum im dritten und vierten quartal aller voraussicht nach jedoch nicht fortsetzen
4108162 inoffiziell kursierten ger chte dass sich tui f r den verkauf von hapaq llyod mindestens eine vier vor dem komma in mrd h he vorgestellt hat vor dem hintergrund der derzeit eher schwierigen konjunkturellen lage habe ich jedoch den eindruck dass man dieses ziel nicht erreichen wird
4108163 daraus wird nichts die d nen sind nicht bereit dar ber zu verhandeln
4108164 die pers nlichen gespr che sind f r uns ein wichtiger faktor wir lernen die menschen kennen und angaben die im pers nlichen gespr ch festgehalten werden entsprechen der wahrheit so ersparen wir unseren kunden viel rger und frust durch vermittlungsfehler

4108171 well when i was gone did you make messes in my room amp clean it up
4108172 damit gilt der messe klassiker norddeutschlands wieder einmal als ein indikator der wirtschaftlichen lage auf dem bau die nordbau boomt und die anzahl der aussteller sowie der zu erwartende besucherandrang sind f r uns auch ein beweis daf r dass insgesamt in diesem jahr f r die bauwirtschaft wenn auch territorial unterschiedlich ein g nstiger konjunktureller verlauf zu erwarten ist
4108173 schutz von b umen und vegetationsbest nden bei bauma nahmen
4108174 alles in allem sind die zahlen trotz der probleme im trading segment immer noch recht gut ausgefallen
4108175 dieser verkauf hat wenn berhaupt nur in absoluten zahlen einen effekt auf die bilanz die verhaltene resonanz stellt sich eher vor dem hintergrund dar dass die vom neuen management ausgegebenen erwartungen nicht best tigt werden konnten
4108176 unsere untersuchungen haben gezeigt dass fast ausnahmslos der preis die motivation f r einen wechsel des anbieters ist die hohe inflation ist l ngst nicht nur mehr gef hlt sondern schl gt sich in den realeinkommen der kunden nieder nimmt man die hohen benzinpreise noch dazu berlegen sich nun viele haushalte schneller wo man noch einige hundert euro im jahr zus tzlich einsparen kann
4108177 die situation gestaltet sich f r die etablierten anbieter mehr und mehr als herausforderung wie mit der neuen lage umzugehen ist zwar gibt es einen anteil sogenannter resignativ zufriedener die sich zwar ber den hohen strompreis rgern jedoch nicht gleich wechseln der gro teil der kunden w gt jedoch den preis samt dem einsparungspotenzial ab
4108178 dieses motiv ziehen nur vier prozent der kunden in betracht
4108179 wie auch die vergangenen quartale zuvor hat vor allem die gestiegene nachfragesituation nach d ngemitteln das wachstum bestimmt diese situation ist von einem globalen trend getrieben dass die weltbev lkerung zunimmt und bev lkerungsbezogen jedes jahr eine neue bundesrepublik dazu kommt

4108182 todos los rivales son de cuidado pero no pienso en la medalla de bronce pienso cambiarle el color y seguir hasta el oro
4108183 en el primer tiempo tuvimos muchas oportunidades y no las pudimos concretar era importante abrir el marcador para poder jugar m s tranquilas y por suerte se me dio

4108221 de resultaten die we vandaag gerapporteerd hebben hebben op geen enkele manier effect op onze fusieplannen
4108222 toen we onze fusie aankondigden wisten we al dat de eerste helft van dit jaar moeilijk zou worden en we hebben dit in onze modellen meegenomen

4108224 ik vind en dat vindt mijn partij natuurlijk ook dat het niet zo is dat als je in het verleden een keer dingen hebt gedaan die niet goed te praten zijn dat je voor je hele leven lang niet meer in de politiek zou kunnen functioneren
4108225 het is natuurlijk afschuwelijk en ik kan het ook gewoon eigenlijk niet meer begrijpen van mezelf dat ik dat gedaan heb en het voelt ook bijna alsof een andere persoon dat gedaan heeft

4108298 my party has already held its convention without a single taxpayer dollar in its support
4108299 it probably doesnt surprise a lot of people that sen barack obamas party is trying to pry more money out of government after all democrats have perfected the art of using a political crowbar to bust open the treasurys doors but why is sen john mccain supposed maverick and reformer going along with the raid how is he any different than any of the other people who fill washington clamoring for a bailout
4108300 unfortunately too many people spend too much time prying money from the feds
4108301 and both parties are to blame its easier to list the groups that dont get federal handouts than those that fill their pockets every year with a half trillion dollar deficit and a 9 5 trillion national debt we obviously cant afford to have all of these people breaking into the treasury all the time
4108302 but what can be more obnoxious than forcing taxpayers to underwrite other peoples political opinions as thomas jefferson told us to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions that he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical youd think someone who postures as an opponent of special interests and government pork wouldnt expect the taxpayers to subsidize his own very special interest political campaign
4108303 it wont be senators barack obama or john mccain both of whom are creatures of the washington establishment sen obama talks about a new politics but his policies look an awful lot like the old liberalism sen mccain says he is a maverick but that doesnt include getting his own political party off of the federal dole when he does break with his own party he lines up with the democrats whenever the issue is individual rights versus government power he chooses government power

4108461 mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits serious consideration despite his support for abortion rights
4108462 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4108463 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4108464 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4108505 as well as trying to figure out what we do with the business
4108506 bachmans has been a family owned and operated business for five generations we have successfully managed leadership transitions many times
4108507 he was just very very well rounded in his knowledge of bachmans operations
4108508 certainly it couldnt be done without the total organization and thats what its taking to focus on whats happening in china and to tend to business here at home
4108509 we have a structure in place that works while todd is out of town and that structure is working now
4108510 the grief is going to be the same regardless of the competency of the management team
4108511 they really put in place a plan that has carried us not only in dealing with ownership issues from the third to the fourth but the fourth to the fifth and the fifth to the sixth
4108512 we now have sixth generation ownership in the company the children of todds children
4108513 theyve been through this long enough that theyve reached that stage which i refer to as the dynastic stage where theyve worked out the transition challenges probably decades earlier
4108514 sometimes it goes to the person who is most qualified and sometimes it goes to the person who is most senior
4108515 the key is to find someone to step in who can continue to grow the companys value
4108516 each of you is doing exactly as todd and barbara would wish you are coming together to support each other you are sharing your wonderful memories and stories of todd and you are continuing to serve our customers
4108517 a total commitment to do whatever needs to be done to support barbara in her recovery to mourn todd and to carry on business
4108518 coming to work that morning and having to tell the staff what had happened was something i will never forget but dont ever want to remember again
4108519 every day is still difficult you see things triggers that will bring up memories it took a long time to have a day without tears for me personally because i had worked so closely with him
4108520 everyone continued on business as usual just with some tears once in a while
4108521 i think were carrying out his wishes by staying open and serving our customers
4108522 it would just not be right to think about not being there to serve our customers which would be the last thing that todd would want
4108523 nach dem fulminanten jahresauftakt wurde die deutsche wirtschaft im zweiten quartal von der realit t eingeholt neben der generellen konjunkturschw che die derzeit in allen industriel ndern zu beobachten ist litt deutschland dabei unter besonders schweren umst nden die kumulierten sondereffekte die die wirtschaftsleistung von januar bis m rz um 1 3 expandieren lie en schlugen nun mit voller wucht zur ck
4108524 wir gehen davon aus dass es im zweiten quartal negative wachstumsbeitr ge vom privaten verbrauch und den anlageinvestitionen gegeben hat positive beitr ge d rften hingegen von den nettoexporten und dem staatsverbrauch gekommen sein
4108525 wir sehen die deutsche wirtschaft nach wie vor nicht auf rezessionskurs sondern gehen vielmehr davon aus dass die konjunktur nach der wachstumspause im sommerhalbjahr bereits im vierten quartal wieder fahrt aufnehmen wird hintergrund dieser einsch tzung ist die annahme dass sich die gegenw rtige korrektur beim lpreis weiter fortsetzt dieser preisr ckgang d rfte sich als regelrechtes konjunkturprogramm erweisen von dem vor allem der private verbrauch profitiert
4108526 die daten f r die wirtschaftsleistung im zweiten quartal liegen im rahmen der wenig optimistischen erwartungen der aufschwung in deutschland geht allm hlich zu ende 2 wachstum im gesamtjahr d rfte das maximum sein zudem besteht mit einem schwachen dritten quartal die reelle gefahr einer technischen rezession in deutschland
4108527 der konjunkturhimmel hat sich merklich verfinstert und die ersten sturmausl ufer sind mit schwachen exporten und einem wieder sinkenden privaten konsum in deutschland angekommen alles in allem stellt sich die konjunkturelle situation zur jahresmitte 2008 schlecht dar denn eine weitere schrumpfung der wirtschaftsleistung im folgequartal ist wahrscheinlich
4108528 die besten zeiten f r die deutsche wirtschaft sind vorerst vorbei f r unsere bip prognose von 2 3 in diesem jahr sehen wir nach den heutigen daten auf jeden fall ein abw rtsrisiko
4108529 alles in allem wird sich der abschwung der deutschen wirtschaft in den kommenden quartalen fortsetzen die risiken weisen klar nach unten mit 0 7 ist unsere wachstumsprognose f r 2009 vorsichtiger als die der meisten volkswirte
4108530 unter strich bleibt eine wachstumsdelle in diesem jahr unser hauptszenario das risiko einer harten landung hat auf kurze sicht aber zugenommen
4108531 nimmt man die ersten beiden quartale zusammen ist die wirtschaft der eurozone annualisiert um 1 und damit unterhalb des trends gewachsen besorgnis erregend ist das die fr hindikatoren auf ein noch schw cheres wachstum im zweiten halbjahr hindeuten eine technische rezession k nnte allerdings vermieden werden
4108532 trotz der j ngsten schlechten stimmungsindikatoren rechnen wir f r das dritte quartal nicht mit einem erneuten bip r ckgang sondern mit einer positiven verlaufsrate von 0 2 das hei t der euroraum wird unseres erachtens knapp an einer rezession vorbeischlittern unsere jahresdurchschnittsprognose f r das wirtschaftswachstum haben wir von bisher 1 7 auf 1 4 nach unten korrigiert
4108533 die wirtschaft im euroraum befindet sich am rand einer rezession zwar ist der r ckgang des bip teilweise eine gegenbewegung auf das durch sonderfaktoren nach oben verzerrte wachstum im ersten vierteljahr aber auch bereinigt um diese effekte hat sich das wachstum markant abgeschw cht
4108534 die stimmungsindikatoren deuten auf ein weiterhin schwaches wachstum hin auch ein neuerlicher r ckgang des bip im dritten quartal und damit eine rezession ist nicht ausgeschlossen auch wenn dies von uns im moment nicht erwartet wird

4108554 i was reading about the u s china economic relationship and how much china was changing to accommodate our import economy and how there are things in the landscape that had never been there before like billboards and highways it was a way to personalize the experience of using products that come from so far away i went to the places where underwear is made to see what it was like to trace that consumer cycle
4108555 i did a number of paintings of pearl farms in china which are flooded fields that are about six feet deep with water there are rows of plastic bottles organized in these fields for miles in every direction attached to each plastic bottle is a string and attached to the string underwater is an oyster with a pearl growing in it theres a grid of trash where these semiprecious items are grown there is a particular challenge to this new work from china because the signifiers that are familiar to us from the american landscape do not translate
4108556 its a little bit of an attack when it happens i do a lot of preparatory sketching with watercolors or acrylic on paper and reading about the subject matter and looking at photographs ive taken it might take me a month to do a painting but completing the actual painting might take only four days
4108557 i wanted to study liberal arts while i studied studio art it was a constant stream of ideas and discussions with interesting people in different disciplines
4108558 i loved how tough she was i appreciated the rigorous art curriculum and discourse and ruthann godollei was both a great teacher and a great role model as an artist really working in the field
4108559 ive always been attracted to places that are a little bit under the radar

4108580 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4108581 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4108582 either ridge or sen joe lieberman would be a transformative vp pick who could help open up the republican party and deliver moderate voters and independents some mccain advisers believe mccain is seriously weighing that option sources say
4108583 but its a tough calculus a pro choice nominee would infuriate the anti abortion element of the conservative base and potentially be a bitter divorce from the religious right

4108622 we made changes to the website in response to feedback weve received from our customers over the last year
4108623 it was time for an update weve expanded our engagement ring selection and added higher quality sidestones to our rings so we took our time and integrated user comments in with the product updates and some other changes we had identified internally
4108624 and great photography we really want the quality of our diamond engagement rings to be evident on the site so we shot more photos and offered more 3d views of our rings
4108625 customers wanted the ability to see the how changing the diamonds size or shape would affect the overall look of the ring
4108626 i am very excited about the new photography diamond slider functionality and 3d images when a customer views a product on our website it has to look like what theyll receive when the order arrives these updates really portray the quality of our diamonds our settings and our bands
4108627 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4108628 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4108629 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4108630 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4108631 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4108632 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4108633 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4108634 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4108635 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4108636 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4108637 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4108638 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4108646 look some of the things that happen to guys on the cover theyre legitimate
4108647 vinnie young for example we put him on the cover last year he missed a game and hed never missed a game in his life
4108648 hed never had surgery in his life ever but the year he was on the cover he went under the knife so these kind of things get into peoples minds
4108649 the media tends to play this sort of thing up but i mean the chances of a player being injured in the nfl are so high that we laugh it all off because its unfounded
4108650 no way weve spoken to plenty of guys from within the league and they dont think its a jinx the players who we work closely with they definitely dont think its a jinx because they know better than anyone how easy it is to get injured or to have a bad season
4108651 every year we get 100 guys calling us begging to appear on the cover its a big deal
4108652 shaun alexander told us after he got hurt he was injured during the 2006 season after appearing on the cover of madden 07 that hed rather be on the cover and injured than not be on the cover and stay healthy all year
4108653 this generation of guys in the league now grew up playing madden to them its the wheaties box of the 21st century

4108656 these olympics have become a significant cultural event that this country is sharing
4108657 and you almost never get that in these days of fractionalized media
4108658 in the past the only way you had to do the olympics was to sit and watch it on tv or maybe you had people over to watch it together
4108659 now people can interact with each other all around the world through blogs through twitter a free social networking and micro blogging service and theyre making it a live remote event media is no longer a one way communication
4108660 its convergence and theyre creating an audience for each other
4108661 giving people more ways to participate online brings more viewers and keeps viewers more engaged so theyre less likely to miss an episode and more likely to talk about it with friends
4108662 its the same reason people watch the world cup because it happens every four years
4108663 and when people ask where were you when michael phelps won his eighth gold medal and crushed mark spitzs record
4108664 the tv ratings alone suggest this is an absolute banner year for the olympics on tv
4108665 i dont see the internet replacing it what were seeing is an augmentation
4108666 swimming is such a short event you can relive it on the web
4108667 were living with four dollar gas high food prices and families unable to afford summer vacations
4108668 americans need something to cheer for and this olympics and this u s team is filling that need
4108669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4108670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4108907 it was the shamble format where everyone moves their ball to the spot of the longest drive and plays stroke play from there
4108908 i sank three of four long putts and normally im not a good putter it might have been the professional caddies lining up our putts for us that helped
4108909 after the tournament and before the dinner i saw my old buddy donald audette and he was lamenting that some team beat his team by a stroke i didnt say anything at that time and he didnt know it was me because the group was listed in david levys name at the dinner we walked up to get our trophy and as i walked by audette i patted him on the head thats when he found out it was my group
4108910 the enthusiasm was unbelievable fabulous i got to play with great players in the most elite junior league in the world it was also encouraging to see guys i played against go up to the nhl and do well i could track my progress that way id see guys succeeding in the nhl and think that i was at least as good
4108911 it was good for me to go to a great team
4108912 i had friends go to weaker teams and never get on track with their careers
4108913 i was upset at first when i got traded to quebec because i was enjoying living in the united states after growing up in canada
4108914 but once i got to quebec city the experience was great we were the only game in town and we were always reminded of why we were there plus i got to experience that intense rivalry with montreal i never really had that again except for the year i played with the rangers and we had the rivalry with the islanders
4108915 we had doug gilmour bernie federko tony hrkac rick meagher and cliff ronning
4108916 that was disheartening because we had a really good team together i played another year there but i dropped to 25 goals
4108917 italy was great for me at my age and that point in my career
4108918 we played two games a week and traveled in a beautiful part of the world i was up to about 220 pounds and playing against guys who averaged 180 so i was able to dominate with my talent and size we didnt have large crowds but they were very dedicated and loud it was like a soccer atmosphere
4108919 what willie oree and gary bettman began we would like to expand and carry the torch going forward
4108920 there was a long gap between willie orees time in the nhl and the era with me and grant fuhr

4108923 our aim with the code project is to help developers in all aspects of their day to day job
4108924 so a job board was a perfect and long overdue fit
4108925 weve experienced the difficulty of finding good developers first hand we need developers to help build more features for our community members finding good developers is hard which is frustrating because so many of the very people we are trying to attract already come to our site
4108926 almost every company ive spoken to has the same challenge so we developed a way to connect our over 5 million members with all those companies looking for good talent and did it in a way that is simple for our readers and simple for a company

4108930 pinkitude is an innovative program merging the power of two very dynamic brands mgm and susan g
4108931 we are excited about this fully integrated marketing campaign that targets an audience of young women who will be touched by the breast cancer message and the knowledge their eye for fashion allows them to be philanthropic
4108932 companies need to do more than talk about green initiatives
4108933 it takes more than high profile ads to make it happen
4108934 being green is an important part of many employees lives and companies do a disservice to themselves and their employees by not acknowledging that
4108935 workers easily see through hypocrisy and lip service and that certainly applies to green programs too
4108936 it is the senators goal each and every season to provide our fans with many affordable ticketing opportunities so that as many fans as possible are able to attend our games
4108937 variable pricing and the support of our partners last season allowed us to provide more than 215 000 affordably priced tickets to our fans we will strive in the current season to meet and exceed this number
4108938 the ad network business model is evolving and our focus on targeting audiences with multiple attributes is specifically meeting demand from marketers collecting billions of behavioral events each day gives us the ability to reach highly valuable audiences at scale
4108939 we are able to meet the growing demand of brand display advertisers to reach their audiences outside of utilizing contextual placement alone
4108940 it made me a better person and a better player
4108941 when you go into rush hour its worth a ticket to see that
4108942 its chaos its every man for himself i experienced the lifestyle in russia it wasnt a good fit for me
4108943 sometimes you have to take a step back to go forward
4108944 i felt i was standing still a little bit in my career ive matured it russia made me realize how bad i want to play in the nhl the game has changed you need to be a more complete player
4108945 what happened in the past is there theres nothing i can do about it it was a crazy couple of years for me but i dont think theres a defined recipe for success
4108946 i dont have a clue about our roster im not very good on the internet i looked at their stats from last year but i dont know how many of those players will be back
4108947 it was out of the blue i wasnt desperate for a job
4108948 i was looking forward to scouting for ottawa i thought since nothing had happened thats how it was going to shake out i would call it the opportunity to go back and work with the flyers it was too good an opportunity to pass by
4108949 it is no factor in me coaching this year but im aware of those numbers
4108950 theres only one team that wins every year things have to fall right you have to have the right mix of players im not thinking about the calder cup right now or even really hockey we have to see what the team is
4108951 my agent just said they came back with going younger going younger going younger
4108952 i would have liked to have stayed but maybe its time to start a career over there yeah id come back but itd have to be worth my while
4108953 i think i have six or seven more years left in me
4108954 theres no doubt in our mind we want to focus on the playoffs
4108955 we had a better season last season than the coyotes did the season before we felt the pressure at the end of the season but we have to learn to cope with it everyones goal in the organization is to get into the playoffs and to win the stanley cup
4108956 its definitely an accomplishment to play as much as i do
4108957 i do like the pressure it means that im playing well and that im earning the ice time that im getting from my coach i like to be in the spotlight
4108958 playing the point on the power play gives you more of a responsibility
4108959 it also gives me more defensive responsibility i like that the coyotes gave me the opportunity to play the point on the power play and i feel it has made me a better defensive player because i am the last player back on my side
4108960 he has speed and skill and a great work ethic he really wants to win he can be very special when youve got a player with all that its hard not to like him
4108961 now hes about 190 and more ready to play were really excited about him
4108962 he has a real chance to make it in the fall
4108963 he was one guy we really targeted due to his speed and skill
4108964 when youre trying to play an up tempo game and rely on forechecking youve got to have that he fits the bill hes so strong on his skates and hes 200 pounds of solid muscle you never know what can happen in training camp and there are jobs to be won here
4108965 he has good skills and his work ethic is something that really impressed the whole scouting staff and management
4108966 we want that type of player on our hockey club he may need a year in the minors but we have openings and if you outplay the other guys youll stay
4108967 hes got to get into it right off the hop
4108968 hes got to show what he can do and play with confidence hes strong on the puck and can score goals and everyone these days is looking for goal scorers
4108969 hes very very calm with the puck maybe too calm
4108970 hes got to pick up his intensity and play with emotion every shift if he does that he has a chance to make the club we have some openings on defense
4108971 summers is going back to michigan and weve moved him to forward

4108974 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4108975 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4108982 this years conference is entitled development of new molecular tumor markers for diagnosis and therapy the subject is well chosen and critical for good reason it reflects the acute need among the scientific community as well as clinicians for new cancer markers to be used in cancer diagnosis and therapy this need arises from the fact that there are presently very few markers their overall performance is not very good and they are limited to a few types of cancer it also reflects on the fact that since afp and cea were first described as cancer markers in the early 60s not many markers have been discovered biocurex has a unique cancer marker in the sense that it combines excellent performance in discriminating patients with cancer from those who do not have cancer along with the ability to detect very early stages of two of the most common cancers breast and prostate recaf our marker also has the potential to be used on a broad spectrum of cancers which is a tremendous advantage at isobm 2008 well be showing results related to the elisa format a type of test that can be carried out in most research and clinical labs we expect to elicit significant interest among scientists to carry out collaborations that will continue to validate independently and through numerous publications the very good performance of the recaf tests

4109069 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
4109070 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
4109071 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
4109072 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
4109073 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
4109074 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers

4109090 disconnect moratoria do not help customers they merely allow customers to dig themselves into a hole from which many of them will not emerge in the end the customers will likely end up without power and will owe their retailer a large bill while these customers may be able to establish service with a different rep by paying a deposit that costs less money than the amount they owe to the retailer that disconnected them in the end its all of us who pay
4109091 why if reps are continually asked to cover the bad debt expense created by these types of moratoria they do so by raising the rates that all of us pay
4109092 by forcing retailers to absorb even more losses by the imposition of disconnect moratoria all that will happen is we will further shrink the field of retail competitors to the large corporations that have the funds to own generating assets and can absorb losses from their retail operations is that the kind of competition we want

4109105 the harm related to disclosure of confidential information in a student or faculty members internet files can be equally harmful
4109106 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4109107 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

4109109 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
4109110 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4109111 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4109112 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4109113 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4109114 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4109115 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4109116 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4109117 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4109118 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4109119 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4109120 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4109121 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4109122 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
4109123 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

4109149 i grew up here as a camper and now i really enjoy helping the kids with the arts and crafts every day they make a different craft to take home

4109153 to keep the momentum and joyous feeling throughout the year
4109154 the kids are always excited about seeing each other again being involved with the church and learning about their faith
4109155 this program is a little bit of heaven here on earth
4109156 based on joshua 24 15 to teach kids to make right choices in a world of options
4109157 the nice thing about our camp is that the teachers are all adults
4109158 the junior helpers help the younger children under the guidance of the adult teachers it really helps with their self esteem
4109159 ive been involved with the program since i was six years old as a camper
4109160 at first i did it because i had to but then i really started to enjoy it as a junior helper i like getting to meet each years new group of kids and i always look forward to next year

4109168 i didnt do what i wanted to i couldnt use any of my techniques i have nothing left
4109169 if i step onto the tatami again i may probably be thrown again im really empty now
4109170 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4109171 operatives from the central intelligence organisation cio seized the mdc leaderships passports and briefly detained them saying their names were on the list
4109172 they did not reveal what so called list was about
4109173 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks hundreds and tens of meetings had been held
4109174 those who are not part of the deliberations and were not mandated by the branches must please stay home
4109175 we request tolerance calm and a peaceful anc conference the police will be vigilant and make sure that the conference is a success without any hindrances
4109176 i suppose you could say it was the end of the school holidays
4109177 as always against the all blacks its going to be great game to be a part of
4109178 you dont get bigger challenges in rugby and both sides really want to win this one
4109179 ive been watching way too much test rugby from the sidelines nowadays last week against the pumas was about the third time this year its never fun to miss a bok outing
4109180 ask me that question on sunday no its been feeling all right obviously we played a lot of rugby last year so sometimes being forced to sit out some can have certain advantages but you also dont always feel comfortable if youre not playing enough im pretty confident for saturday though
4109181 definitely not miss it that much it was a tough encounter jerry was one of a kind a respected opponent but every win against the all blacks is satisfying and makes the effort all worthwhile
4109182 hes a fantastic player and besides that his leadership is important he brings them a value john smit gives to us richie had a big input in their victory over australia last time out
4109183 all tests especially against the all blacks will be a tactical battle
4109184 ive always been allowed to do what i want to perhaps even more so now
4109185 the all blacks are always a difficult side and we have a very difficult three weeks ahead
4109186 i worked hard and im pleased to be back its difficult to say how close i am to my best
4109187 im proud to be a member of south african society i just want to play rugby the coach peter de villiers picked me and i will do my very best
4109188 theyre a different side when richie plays he brings something to the team
4109189 one of my very favorite life experiences period that may seem odd but id always thought that it would be really cool to be in new york city during a massive power outage like the one they had in 1965 and on august 14 2003 i found out that i was right it was really cool
4109190 this was a once in a lifetime experience and i wanted to really experience it i had always wondered somewhat jealously what it must have been like for new yorkers in 65 and 77 to see this city in the dark and now was my chance so without any clear idea where i would be sleeping or what i would do once it got fully dark i started walking toward times square
4109191 5 years after a giant blackout are we better off
4109192 repeat of massive 2003 blackout less likely today says power overseer
4109193 i just had an incredible tour up north performing 12 times in 3 days to thousands of high schoolers for most of them it was the first time theyve ever heard the gospel
4109194 and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because laura was over there trying to buy a house today

4109198 its going quite well ive only had a week and a half with the squad im back into the team earlier than i expected but i worked hard while i was injured to get back into the squad
4109199 i havent played a full game in three months now so i think ricky will get a bit of gametime
4109200 its difficult to say what my form is like because i havent played enough but im getting there obviously playing the all blacks isnt the easiest game around
4109201 hes the same age as me so since u19s weve played against each other he brings something different to their team
4109202 i think the all blacks changed their tactics in the second test against australia cowen and carter kicked a lot and it obviously worked well for them
4109203 im starting to get there i obviously first wanted to get into the squad and now into the team ive still got some responsibility but for now i just want to get my form back and help the team play better
4109204 ive always been allowed to do whatever ive wanted even more so now i can do whatever i want to on the field but ill always do what i think is best for the team
4109205 the thing is there are still a lot of different rules around were playing the currie cup under yet another set so its a little confusing i think at the end of the super 14 the elvs were a lot better for us i think the bulls just took too long to adapt to them
4109206 you have to accept the elvs as south africans we did so well under the old rules why would we support the new ones but theyre here now and weve all accepted it well just have to see what rules well play under next year
4109207 its a very big compliment to hear that from coaches of that caliber ive been called the worse scrum half in the world too so i dont read too much into it i just want to get back to my top form whatever they say is probably based on last years form
4109208 i think in test matches against the all blacks whether its under old rules new rules or whatever rules there will always be a lot of kicking
4109209 thats test match rugby its always a tactical battle but theres room for everything in the new game so therell be a lot of kicking but a lot of running as well well just have to see how the game evolves
4109210 ive only played 30 minutes against a weakened argentina team so its difficult to comment on de villiers style but its not that much different to what ive been used to over the years even at the bulls at the end of the super 14
4109211 i dont want to get involved in politics im just a south african who wants to play rugby

4109298 whether california faces rosy or gloomy times we must always make public safety the number one priority if our streets parks and schools arent safe from gang violence and other crimes then nothing else really matters
4109299 democratic members of the budget conference committee have approved deep cuts to public safety programs including the citizens option for public safety which provides for front line law enforcement and the juvenile justice crime prevention act while altogether eliminating several vital programs such as californias methamphetamine interdiction program and the small and rural county sheriffs grant program combined with a proposed corrections package that puts some offenders back out on the streets without supervision these cuts will significantly exacerbate the ability of law enforcement to provide essential public safety services these programs are critical in preventing our most at risk youths from joining gangs getting involved in drugs and entering a lifetime of crime
4109300 in addition to protecting important gang prevention and intervention funding this initiative prohibits bail to illegal aliens who are charged with violent or gang crimes it creates tougher punishment for gang crimes drive by shootings methamphetamine distribution and victim intimidation it helps victims who have been intimidated by gang criminals and it funds victim witness protection programs in our communities
4109301 divert s billions from californias schools hospitals and childcare centers by funding failed prison and policing policies it would deepen the states ongoing budget crisis
4109302 half of californians are in favor of cutting prison spending only 3 6 of californians are in favor of cutting health care funds and 5 in favor of cutting school funding proposition 6 will increase funding to prisons and cut funding to health care and schools
4109303 target s undocumented immigrants by denying bail to those charged with violent or gang related crimes and requiring local sheriffs to inform immigration and customs enforcement ice of the arrest and charges of people who are undocumented

4109311 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939
4109312 now look what theyre doing this has already exceeded my worst expectations
4109313 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue

4109317 nothing has jumped out in terms of the investigation its still early we still have a lot to do over the course of two days
4109318 possible reasons for this could include spatial disorientation loss of a critical flight instrument an external factor like severe wind gusts or wake turbulence or simply pilot error

4109325 dont worry about my time this day is for you
4109326 he lived his life to help others and that is why he was a truly happy person
4109327 i would say he was an anchor of the community as well as the church
4109328 he was just doing good deeds out of the kindness of his heart without looking for any kind of acknowledgment ever

4109332 my daughters said this morning that it wont be the same without him as principal there
4109333 i fully appreciate the fact that without the mayors and superintendents unqualified support the already difficult and challenging job of being the high school principal becomes next to impossible
4109334 im certainly not in a position to say what the interim arrangements will be at this point
4109335 with the mayor not talking about it this became something dark and shameful that were not learning from
4109336 to find out youre pregnant at 15 is enough you dont need it broadcast to the world
4109337 i dont know how i would have dealt with it
4109338 ive been working here for three years and we only get a handful of holes in one a year
4109339 to see two people from the same family make a hole in one in the same week is pretty impressive
4109340 he pretty much said what he was going to do and he did it
4109341 the greens are very small the fairways and the holes are very narrow
4109342 they all just started yelling and screaming and high fiving
4109343 i remember the day he beat me the first time
4109344 i dont think he talked to me for a week
4109345 two to one he puts it in the woods watch that right over there
4109346 thats a lot of cocaine for wakefield its a lot of cocaine for a lot of towns and municipalities
4109347 i want to particularly commend chief smith and the wakefield police department for their focused coordinated efforts in investigating drug crimes
4109348 their efforts not only resulted in this significant arrest but will continue to make wakefield a safer place for its children and families
4109349 this was a very tangled web that involved a lot of people
4109350 a relic from the old conservatism when privacy was considered sacrosanct and public expressions of religiosity were considered vulgar and in bad taste
4109351 were paying for the service and the delightful view and if i were not such a miser i would not even mention the price
4109352 we have been working on this kind of agreement for a while but the time has been well spent because we now have gotten it right
4109353 we have today an excellent understanding that will commit the joint resources of our companies to the goal of a premium resort style casino which will bring new jobs to the area
4109354 i cant tell you what it will look like in six months because i dont know whats going to happen
4109355 at some point it began to make sense for the both of us
4109356 it just made sense to say ok we cant get anything done in the legislature
4109357 at some point it began to make sense for the both of us
4109358 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax

4109404 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4109405 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4109406 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4109407 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4109431 a decision has been taken to appoint a retired high court judge to conduct a judicial inquiry into wednesdays clash between farmers and the police in greater noida
4109432 besides the ex gratia payment of rs 200 000 that had already been awarded by the greater noida authority the chief minister has decided to give an additional compensation of rs 300 000 to the family of each of the deceased
4109433 the rate at which the final compensation was paid to the farmers towards their acquired land was more than double of what was originally agreed upon between the greater noida authority and the farmers
4109434 there exists many misconceptions regarding the functioning of unam due to ignorance on the part of the press our university comparing to the best in the world is totally in line with the rest of the academic world and to meet the challenges of professions in the country with regard to its courses and curriculum
4109435 as a world recognised reputable institution we believe in the universitys mission its goals and in quality education in this ranking system we have done better than universities such as fort hare the university of botswana and others in the region this position we have maintained something all namibians should be proud of
4109436 if the university had been a mickey mouse institution it would not have attracted top overseas university partners we have signed a number of agreements with universities in south africa and even the university of the united nations
4109437 in 2005 unam took a major step in reviewing all curricula in order to respond to the needs of the country our teaching and learning programmes are all in line with current trends in the academic world and the namibian qualification framework in reviewing the programmes all stakeholders including the government and industries were fully involved and engaged
4109438 south african universities do three year degrees whereas unam has a four year degree whereby we are meeting requirements of level 8 furthermore in each of the courses at unam we have introduced research methodology and modalities to continuously enhance the quality of the content we strive at all times to achieve and attain quality outcomes
4109439 inherently all courses demand a more participatory and interactive approach from both students and lecturers one has to keep in mind that professors are not trained teachers in view of that a teaching and learning unit has been established to help improve lecture skills ongoing workshops are periodically held to further empower the more than 300 lecturers at unam
4109440 we are in the process of changing things to improve education to the benefit of our students there is just no way unam can compromise the standards and the quality of education it offers and its standing in the world by lowering those standards
4109441 the objectives of all courses have to be achieved and attained a decision that was taken in good faith to correct an anomaly that happened communication in english is not only a problem at unam but at universities globally the problem cannot be overcome overnight

4109505 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
4109506 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
4109507 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
4109508 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
4109509 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
4109510 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
4109511 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
4109512 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
4109513 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
4109514 social democracy is still here in all its variants defining our entire respectable political spectrum from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right we are now trapped in america inside a menshevik fantasy with the narrow bounds of respectable debate set for us by various brands of marxists it is now our task the task of the resurgent right of the paleo movement to break those bonds to finish the job to finish off marxism forever

4109516 as soon as possible we must follow this aid with broader reconstruction assistance including emergency economic loans to help the people of georgia rebuild their lives and their economy

4109521 an elevator shaft is a typical example of a shear wall retaining wall s as a whole structure tend to rely a lot on gravity and soil resistance to properly function compared to shear wall think of shear wall as multiples of columns placed next to one another continously they acts as stiffeners apart from carrying load they resist lateral drifts of a building
4109522 at least for now there is a tenuous cease fire in georgia as medvedev called off the dogs reports on four different eu and russian networks indicate sporadic shooting by georgia probably us israeli advisor mercenaries and the russians are returning fire when fired upon
4109523 we are bidding final farewell to the soviet union the ussr will never come back here we urge ukraine and other members of the cis to leave the organization which russia administers
4109524 the european union must be prepared to commit itself including on the ground
4109525 many countries have said that they are ready to join in
4109526 we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
4109527 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4109528 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4109529 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
4109530 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4109531 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4109532 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4109533 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4109534 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4109535 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4109536 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4109537 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
4109538 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4109539 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4109540 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
4109541 the russian troops are destroying the city of gori they are mining the city they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4109542 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4109543 only served to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4109544 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4109545 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
4109546 we would like to underline that the representatives of international and humanitarian organisations have not been granted an access in the territories controlled by the russian armed forces
4109547 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
4109548 only western peacekeepers can end the war i have staked my countrys fate on the wests rhetoric about democracy and liberty
4109549 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st century system of security
4109550 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4109551 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension
4109552 that to ensure womens rights are not only guaranteed but applied in their daily lives women themselves must know what these rights are

4109568 the money madrid are asking for is exaggerated in todays market
4109569 all of these things are coming together in a confluence of events thats creating tremendous pressure on the industry

4109571 lorry straps are probably the most common item of debris we pick up from the motorway

4109591 instead of a real debate about how to move forward in afghanistan its clear that the republicans would rather launch tired and old attacks to distract people from their record of completely failing to finish the fight against the taliban and al qaeda
4109592 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on barack obama for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people empty words about bipartisanship mean nothing just days after the mccain campaign accused barack obama of being in sync with moscow and not putting his country first senator obama is focused on what the united states and the international community must do to resolve this crisis not on the tired political games that have stood in the way of progress
4109593 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4109594 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4109595 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4109596 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4109597 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4109598 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4109599 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4109600 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4109601 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4109602 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4109603 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4109604 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4109605 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4109606 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4109607 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4109608 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4109609 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4109610 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4109611 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4109612 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4109613 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4109614 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
4109615 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
4109616 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
4109617 john mccain sure must think a lot of himself to be running around the country judging other peoples patriotism
4109618 democrats all too often do put up with these attacks
4109619 and thats why far too many voters dont think we have what it takes to defend the country because we wont even defend ourselves
4109620 this election cycle a lot of barriers are being broken
4109621 at the congressional level we are showing that people are willing to elect a candidate based on their values and ideas and not their sexual orientation
4109622 signed a 200 000 contract to continue providing strategic advice to the georgian government in washington
4109623 senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
4109624 at this point in time we didnt think it opportune to bring him
4109625 we have to start with the right mentality but nobody who stands out will have the door shut on them

4109654 we deny this the bank did not buy its shares on the market
4109655 hopefully in the next six months we will utilise that capacity
4109656 so instead of being up 15 as we promised the market we are down 2 and the reason for that is that industrial wage negotiations that went on during that period
4109657 our workforce wanted more than what was agreed on and during that period for two months they refused to work overtime and also they went on a go slow so we are 2 down on our production volume growth in the last month of this period we had administrative staff directors and management operating machinery on sundays so production would have been down more than that but the last month we decided we had had enough and we manned the factory and we had very good production
4109658 we dont speculate in copper at all we buy as we need for production and we dont hedge any copper we dont take any risks on the copper side
4109659 the entire property oil blocks and control over petroleum and accompanying substances in whatever physical state located in any land in zambia is hereby vested exclusively in the president on behalf of the state

4109674 every word comes with one or more frames most frames are unconscious and have just developed naturally and haphazardly and have come into the publics mind through common use

4109694 i think the age gap charlotte church has left is fab
4109695 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4109696 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4109697 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4109698 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4109699 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4109700 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
4109701 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4109702 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4109703 if the republicans believed a fraction of their own rhetoric about the importance of confirming strict constructionists to the high court they would have worked to block the ginsberg and breyer appointments
4109704 and since thats the politics promoted by most leading members of the cbc youd think theyd like that but apparently they put race over policy
4109705 generation after generation has been told that all idealists go into politics and government whereas greedy people go into business it is not only untrue the truth is the opposite the politician may claim to have ideals but they mostly serve as a mask for the desire to exercise power
4109706 young people are not raw material to be employed by the political class on behalf of whatever fashionable political military or social cause catches its fancy in a free society their lives are not the playthings of government

4109713 although over 30 azerbaijani families residing in tedotsminda village of gori region left the village they have not yet been registered at the refugees camp
4109714 it was impossible to contact with the elderly people and heads of families who remained in the village although the congresss members wanted to visit the village they were banned to do this
4109715 there are few azerbaijanis living in georgia amongst those who left the country
4109716 settlements around gori region where azerbaijanis live were not damaged
4109717 no the fair way to argue is that i get to dictate everything and i now hereby dictate that i get the whole pie
4109718 a division that compels everyone to admit that the division is fair
4109719 the fair resolution procedure is that i get to decide whats fair
4109720 you and perhaps some others are merely doing things your way rather than denniss
4109721 regardless of what dennis says giving him the whole pie isnt fair because fairness is not defined entirely and only in terms of denniss agreement
4109722 giving n people each 1 nth is nonetheless a fair sort of thing to do

4109725 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4109726 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4109727 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4109728 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4109729 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4109730 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4109731 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4109732 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4109733 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4109734 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

4109738 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4109739 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4109740 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4109741 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4109761 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
4109762 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software

4109794 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4109795 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4109796 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4109823 its been a long while since ive had a round with no bogeys
4109824 i had plenty of them last week thats for sure
4109825 ive not played a good round in what feels like forever but i played some really really great golf there
4109826 youve got to turn the corner somewhere so hopefully this is where it starts
4109827 even if i win here im not going to be in the team but i believe i still have an opportunity to make the side in the next two weeks
4109828 a few weeks ago things were driving me insane i was playing god awful and what should have been a fantastic year had turned into a horrid one on and off the course for me and my family
4109829 it would have been the easiest thing to say im not going to bother and i cant wait for the year to end but while i am still playing im going to try to turn it around
4109830 if i dont make it though i wont feel disappointed with myself ive done what i can and playing is fully acceptable
4109831 it would normally upset me more but my head was not in it it felt like jetlag
4109832 i played very poorly but i still feel good about tomorrow
4109833 for the privilege of remembering a beautiful young life cruelly taken
4109834 what we have in reality is emotional grief exacerbated by financial grief and for what this is downright robbery
4109835 is the grief of burying a loved one not sufficient without being held to ransom pay the exorbitant fee or leave the grave unmarked
4109836 to say i am totally disgusted by this blatant profiteering is an understatement once the grave is occupied and the council has extracted its pound of flesh the cost for authorising a headstone should surely be the same for all persons
4109837 i found this incredulous because as any parent or relative of a child in the childrens cemetery will tell you we maintain the graves of our loved ones so that they do not suffer the same neglect as other unused areas which are overgrown with weeds
4109838 all the responses were at best ill informed and at worse totally disingenuous i was left wondering whether the cost was actually just for a piece of paper that authorised the erection of a memorial at that price i would have expected a platinum plaque
4109839 the morality of this can only be described as iniquitous is it not time our elected council started treating people fairly and with compassion
4109840 mays lane cemetery is run by the town council on behalf of the people of the original ecclesiastical parishes of st peters and st bartholomews which includes earley and woodley
4109841 we charge a commercial rate for anyone outside the parish and a concessionary rate for those within the town which has been the case since i have been on the council for 17 years
4109842 the truth is we are losing money on it and unfortunately the cost has gone up

4109853 nissa now looks completely rejuvenated and has been given a new lease of life
4109854 this type of working commitment also shows the creativity of the relationships that housing associations and their lenders can have especially given the recent pressures both within the housing and financial markets
4109855 we are involved in a wide range of community programmes and local initiatives and take pride in offering support to the communities around us
4109856 we are delighted to have been able to offer a helping hand to nissa ashram and participate in this extremely worthwhile community project
4109857 these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground
4109858 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4109859 very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
4109860 it is very likely that a burial ceremony would have been held at the tombs perhaps attended by many people
4109861 we know that some families hired professional mourners who would weep and wail and add to the atmosphere of the burial
4109862 for the first time we are starting to understand the layout of the civilian settlement that provided services to the garrison of the fort and we can catch a glimpse of the roman way of life and death on the northern frontier of the empire

4109864 our work with the kirkgate shopping centre shows that simple but effective methods of saving energy such as switching off lights and increasing recycling can make a huge difference

4109866 i am pleased that bradford council has been chosen as an example of good practice
4109867 we have worked hard to take a lead on tackling climate change and our experience is now being used to help others do the same
4109868 bradfords work with the kirkgate shopping centre shows that cities can play a key role in facilitating partnerships between property owners and occupiers as well as raising awareness about energy efficiency and highlighting good practice out there

4109898 i was very confident for the first time for a long while you know youve got to turn the corner sometime and that was today
4109899 i hadnt expected nick to pick me but if i just miss out after playing well for the next three weeks maybe he will
4109900 it was a challenging year at times we had some injuries but we still felt we should have been there and to me thats all im focused on trying to help my team get to the playoffs
4109901 wow that person has spent most of their life and countless amounts of money honing a completely worthless skill
4109902 waarschijnlijk is ze gewoon met haar moeder mee terug naar polen
4109903 ik heb de moeder gemaild maar geen antwoord gekregen ik maak me een beetje zorgen
4109904 we hebben vaker zoiets bij de hand gehad heb je verder nog afwezigen
4109905 een broer en een zus die allebei tegelijkertijd ziek zijn dat is altijd een beetje verdacht
4109906 en een kind dat zonder bericht is weggebleven bij de speciale basisschool waar het broertje op zit heeft een oom gemeld dat de familie op de terugweg autopech in spanje heeft gekregen maar waarom belt de familie niet even met mij
4109907 maar een kind dat te laat komt begint het schooljaar heel slecht
4109908 ze zullen in elk geval een rekening van de garage moeten laten zien
4109909 ik ben op huisbezoek geweest bij een jongen die er niet was een oudere broer zei heel onwillig dat de familie eind deze week pas terug komt uit marokko
4109910 kijk een bolletje die familie is vorig jaar ook niet op tijd op school gekomen dat is toch zorgelijk dat wordt misschien een zorgmelding
4109911 ik heb wel meegemaakt dat een kind na mijn melding meteen goed werd begeleid met dat kind gaat het nu goed
4109912 surinaamse moeder met vijf kinderen schat van een vrouw maar nogal na ef

4109914 the danger with these crime response units is overzealous enforcement
4109915 the danger is pressure on these units to produce arrests
4109916 they are running and gunning just to keep their stats up without regard to quality cases
4109917 theres a lot of crime going on there are problems that the community has asked us to address
4109918 you dont have to shake down every single person you see to do that
4109919 are we going to mistreat people are we going to harass people
4109920 theyre arresting lots of felons and theyre doing a good job at it
4109921 theyre back out again in terms of that revolving door
4109922 what youre attempting to do here is to deter serious crime by making arrests for petty offenses
4109923 if youre attempting to take over our neighborhoods and victimizing our coming after you
4109924 i know that but theres a crosswalk right there you cant be impeding traffic
4109925 they are running and gunning just to keep their stats up without regard to quality cases
4109926 the quantity of felony arrests is what will allow them to keep their jobs so they are getting cases any way they can
4109927 im like what we aint doing nothing but cross the street
4109928 it can get to the point within neigborhoods where if the tactics are too frequent and too aggressive then it starts to backfire and the good citizens in the community get tired of being searched
4109929 go find some real crime to fight cause there is real crime out there to fight this isnt it
4109930 when thats what theyre doing it says to me somebodys trying to rack up numbers
4109931 officers say theyre bordering on violation of search and seizure laws
4109932 they noticed some white powdered substance on the upper lip
4109933 cru officers have weighed the entire crack pipe with residue and submitted the submission as that total weight
4109934 theyre getting charged with a higher crime in the end were going to have to go back and undo some of these prosecutions
4109935 its all about taking criminals off the streets of our neighborhoods
4109936 we could find no instance where inflating drug weights occurred there was never a problem with any of those cases
4109937 theyre arresting lots of felons and theyre doing a good job at it
4109938 sort of wow harvard now costs less for me than the university of maine
4109939 its almost like harvard is rewarding you for doing hard work
4109940 when harvard does something like this all higher education takes notice
4109941 it has put the issue of college affordability that much more in the spotlight
4109942 it was really clear that we were just not getting the very good middle income students to even think about harvard
4109943 they were almost automatically going straight to the great flagship public universities
4109944 we had a great fear we were becoming unaffordable and inaccessible
4109945 now i think we can make a great case we are neither
4109946 the announcements have been very important in helping tell families that financial aid reaches pretty high up
4109947 they should not rule out colleges based on a sticker price that looks really high
4109948 the extension of financial aid to middle class students is a good thing politically
4109949 there is no government plan to say for example from this point they will go by bus
4109950 we want to be present at the sites to know what the next step is
4109951 we will go with them back into the community we will make sure that they gain access into their houses and that they are safe
4109952 the rental at one place was r1060 for water and lights but most people also want a deposit
4109953 the rate of inflation for all commodities for the week ended august 2 2008 stands at 12 44 per cent higher than the rate of 12 01 per cent reported last week after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
4109954 i have not received the court order let me first read it before commenting on my plan of action
4109955 dialogue is the only way to resolve the present crisis
4109956 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society
4109957 the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult
4109958 there have been instances in our country of people taking law into their own hands and causing destruction to life and public property
4109959 hal plans to roll out 100 aircraft in matter of six years the first set of 42 would be completed by 2011
4109960 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
4109961 the parties could not find each other regrettably the court will have to decide on the dates
4109962 it gives him a better operating space because now he can actually report substantial progress and it came at a critical point for the pressure that he was under both domestically and internationally
4109963 whatever progress and achievements made during this week may amount to nothing if a deal is not achieved soon
4109964 it has to happen soon otherwise the goodwill and limited trust may disappear
4109965 to the extent that the approach by president mbeki led to mugabe and zanu pf to get to the negotiation table then the much aligned strategy did pay off
4109966 no other country outside south africa would have been able to get mugabe to sit around a table
4109967 its hard to ascribe directly the deterioration in zimbabwe to south african non action but a more critical and vocal stance might have given the mugabe regime pause and perhaps assist to arrest the deterioration at an earlier stage
4109968 by taking this soft approach we have perhaps in many respects allowed this to continue much longer than it ever should have
4109969 they seem not to be in favour of naming and shaming
4109970 a very dangerous situation and a drawn out process for all parties
4109971 in every country of the world including germany internet pages are blocked here its right wing websites which are locked down and of course in china there are pages as well which will be censored
4109972 but free access should be provided to all important information needed by journalists to do their work
4109973 one of the most widely spoken languages in india which is no mean feat considering that there are 22 official languages here
4109974 we want a reconditioned and more powerful public opinion in a universal organization

4109978 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4109979 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4109980 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4109981 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4109982 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4109983 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
