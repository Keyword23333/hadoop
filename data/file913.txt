9130068 first of all i highly doubt that sanctions might ever happen but hypothetically speaking this would be to the detriment of the european union as much if not more than to russia
9130069 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
9130070 i can only express the wish that european leaders will be able to rise above the emotions of the day and consider seriously and without prejudice the perspectives of strategic partnership with their important partner the russian federation
9130071 we need the new agreement as much as the eu does not less not more
9130072 we are strongly committed to keeping open channels to russia we have to look at who will be hurt by sanctions what will be the costs and benefits
9130073 sanctions would play into the hands of radical elements in moscow who want an escalation of the conflict
9130074 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
9130075 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states about weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them

9130119 i know him very well he played poker at my house many a night my father was one of his early supporters since his time in our legislature
9130120 its not easy for a freshman legislator to be taken seriously barak asked to be given a difficult task he was offered campaign reform which had languished for decades in our legislature he agreed to undertake the thankless task of campaign reform this freshman legislator actually built a coalition of democrats and republicans and passed serious campaign reform
9130121 that anyone would call him an elitist is ridiculous to anyone back home who knows him hes a real family man and the most down home guy youd ever want to know
9130122 i played poker with him on many saturday nights and hes a very conservative poker player
9130123 he will make an excellent president and michelle will be an excellent first lady she is one classy woman
9130124 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
9130125 18 million people voted for hillary i can get those votes if i put a girl on the ticket
9130126 the choice of sarah palin into anything but a brilliant choice
9130127 nunca andes por el camino trazado pues l te conduce nicamente hacia donde los otros fueron
9130128 i lit into them before the game they came out a little sluggish in pregame
9130129 i was calm at halftime i just told them what we were doing wrong we just had too many mistakes didnt tackle worth a crap had too many penalties
9130130 we just need four or five more guys sometimes thats all you need thats the different between aaa and aa
9130131 we didnt run the ball as good as were used to
9130132 but we executed and blocked who were supposed to and i made the right calls
9130133 he was a good friend of mine i cant believe this has happened
9130134 perry did a good job with a great running back of taking it to us
9130135 but we did a much better job of controlling the line of scrimmage in the second half and the offense got it going
9130136 we just did a better job of blocking in the second half
9130137 hes a good player and we werent helping him too much
9130138 they executed much better than we did in the second half
9130139 as we considered the many options to reduce our state operating funds over the next two fiscal years it became overwhelmingly apparent the choice that would impact the fewest veterans in our state was to close the domiciliary care unit at the milledgeville state veterans home
9130140 this is a very painful option to undertake one that will have consequences for the about 80 residents currently in the unit
9130141 theyve got some great athletes over here and we were real apprehensive about what was coming
9130142 they did a good job of stopping our outside stuff so we were able to go inside
9130143 he has been relieved of a large chunk of his pay packet and other ministerial perks
9130144 at halftime we felt like that we as a team had been part of the problem
9130145 we had some costly penalties and didnt make very good decisions i felt like if we came out and started the third quarter emotional depth would become a factor and it did
9130146 we knew running it was the way to go so thats what we went with in the second half
9130147 we really stress no turnovers for us we feel like if we can go turnover free we have a good shot and in a game like this it made the difference
9130148 the next thing i know the balls out so i snatched him down and fell on it
9130149 thats always a big plus to put somebody in a hole early
9130150 we were 1 9 last year and the kids need to learn to win again
9130151 football games are about momentum and we couldnt catch a break
9130152 i tell you what hes the best linebacker that nobody around here seems to want to talk about
9130153 this is the last time that this group of seniors will face a bibb county team and theyve never lost to them in their time here
9130154 so its definitely good that theyll be able to keep that streak as they go out this season
9130155 weve been the team to beat in macon ever since ive been here actually even before i was a freshman
9130156 we just didnt want to let that streak go hopefully in the playoffs well really be able to show we deserve to be on top
9130157 i dont know if their defense was really all that tough but it was that we turned the ball over a lot
9130158 we gave them four touchdowns off turnovers we just got a little caught up in the hype of the rivalry
9130159 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9130160 half of our team i havent seen play in a georgia southern uniform
9130161 i think i just counted that 17 of the 22 on the two deep lineup on offense i have never seen play in a college football game on defense 13 of the 22 i have never seen play in a college game
9130162 do you have players in the right position how will we react when we face adversity and at some point in every game you do face some type of adversity
9130163 are we going to go up there and have 11 men on the field and are all 11 going to go to the right location will we be intimidated playing in a big stadium i dont know
9130164 a couple of years down the road when weve got things rolling with players that have played a multitude of games then you can spend more time gearing up for your opponent but right now we have been working on us
9130165 if we were playing at home i would have the p a announcer announce them both as starters
9130166 one hasnt pulled away from the other and that was what i was looking for
9130167 i think its more important to the people outside as to who starts we have three good leaders there but weve narrowed it down to two now i think the team feels confident about either guy
9130168 her checking balance was like 67 her story on all that was that miss myrtle was loaning her 1 500 and she helped miss myrtle with her banking
9130169 of course we couldnt use the flunking of the polygraph as evidence in the trial but it was a tool
9130170 but she claims it was purely medicinal and she didnt try to kill the woman although she never bothered to tell anybody about it
9130171 its definitely a confidence builder and thats what we need right now
9130172 our defense set the tone for us and mahoney is tough to stop i was very pleased with our first quarter
9130173 we have a 250 000 home what are we going to do with it in this market were really in a hard place
9130174 people arent even coming to school now because they dont think theyll get credit
9130175 those are the one that will suffer so we want to help them out as much as we can
9130176 i have no idea what the motive is at this time
9130177 were interviewing family members and acquaintances now to try to piece together what led to this
9130178 im really curious to see who the punt returner is going to be
9130179 im really curious to see how that offensive line plays together im curious to see how place kicker blair walsh will handle his responsibility im curious to see the freshmen the redshirt and true freshmen to see how they react to their first opportunity
9130180 were excited to get this thing rolling were excited to hit somebody other than ourselves and get out there and play a different team
9130181 we know its a long road ahead and a lot of tough games from the first one to the last one and weve just got to go out there and work hard
9130182 last year we didnt have many experienced players but those guys stayed together from the spring through the fall camp and almost through the entire season
9130183 we didnt have much change weve been juggling more in this camp than we did all year last year put together
9130184 for me its my job to trust them every time and theyve been doing a good job in practice
9130185 i do trust them and i think this time last year we werent this good up front we werent protecting as well as we were now and thats a good sign
9130186 a lot of guys have been out but theyre slowly but surely coming back
9130187 theyre not ready to play a 70 play game but we never ask our defensive line guys to do that were expecting it to be a high tempo type of atmosphere were probably going to have to play a lot of guys
9130188 he hasnt made every single kick but i think hes doing well
9130189 i think hes excited and confident in his abilities and he should be hes very talented and hes had a good camp its just that the rubbers about to meet the road here
9130190 there could be some adjusting on the fly in a hurry out there
9130191 there are some battles that have been so close that within the first quarter you may say you know what this guys struggling im going with the other guy
9130192 its going to take a while to get into any kind of groove or rhythm and really understand what were capable of doing
9130193 the guys are probably just as curious as the coaches are to see whats going to happen here
9130194 i know stafford is very interested in getting a picture with uga vii since thats his jersey number
9130195 youd like to measure the decibels when they do introduce him
9130196 its not how well jump over the obstacles nor how fast you get on the top but how often you stop and appreciate the simple things in life which makes life worthwhile
9130197 i tell you the past is a bucket of ashes

9130206 heathers father was an anglican missionary and she has a very strong social conscience
9130207 wed probably like to do something in that area just part time or whatever
9130208 but wed want to become totally irrelevant because youve got to be able to do that sort of work based on what the work is not on the basis of who you are
9130209 he had the opportunity to do missionary work earlier this year when he was offered the 300 000 plus a year job as queensland trade commissioner to the americas
9130210 if he really wanted to do missionary work he could have refused that job i think hes certainly not lost his mastery of trying to put a public relations spin on his current position
9130211 you do think about the issues of spirituality you do think about mortality the social issues of the world
9130212 those are important questions and if you dont deal with those then youre either a moron youre shallow or youre dead
9130213 he would be good at whatever he turned his hand to and if he wants to give back to the community in that way then all power to him
9130214 i know peter beattie very well and clearly he is a man of great faith and would have an enormous amount to contribute and he would be welcome to join us in missionary work anytime he likes
9130215 the break has been invaluable it wasnt an easy decision to make but it has paid off
9130216 it is not easy to play cricket 24 7 but the break gave my body a rest and gave me time to remember why i am so passionate about the game
9130217 ive definitely got my passion back ive got itchy feet for sure
9130218 i have talked at length with my physios and we all agree that i am ready to play i have told cricket australia i am ready
9130219 all of the theories are based on circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition
9130220 thats why being another theory i dont think this is jack the ripper but it cant be ruled out
9130221 i dont know that digging up people on a speculative basis would be appropriate
9130222 it is possible we might still find out one day who jack the ripper was it is equally possible that no one will ever know
9130223 we believe this blatant abuse of the single voyage permit and multi voyage permit systems is nothing less than an attack on australian seafarers rights to support australian cargoes on the australian coast
9130224 our position and the crews is that this is our occupation this is our coast and were looking for a new vessel to continue on within the trade and be australian manned
9130225 at the moment australians can be set aside by foreign crews trading in australian ports its bloody outrageous
9130226 the crew want an outcome thats open and transparent or theyre not sailing from newcastle
9130227 they will lock it up raise the gangways and thats it
9130228 this case highlights the urgent need for the federal government to get serious and show their commitment to revitalising the australian shipping industry
9130229 the crew want to know that this government is going to do something about it in the future so australian jobs cant be sold to the cheapest labour forces in the world
9130230 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off
9130231 i always had to chase the rhythm of playing on that particular surface that i was wanting to play on
9130232 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9130233 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9130234 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9130235 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9130236 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9130237 heathers father was an anglican missionary and she has a very strong social conscience

9130246 i thought our kids played hard weve just got to work on getting a little bit better
9130247 weve got big play potential i thought we did coming into the season marquez is a threat any time he touches it we threw the ball pretty darn good for the first game its going to get better

9130358 the worst situation was the plane from gatwick in london arriving here and then going on to ottawa
9130359 so theyre on the tarmac the next day waiting to be pushed back from the gate they wait and wait and finally the captain is informed that the plane is going nowhere after all that they had to evacuate the jet
9130360 and we put up about 30 of them in our observation deck overnight
9130361 i may have seen one or two familiar faces still here but the rest have gone on their way now
9130362 the cancellation of zoom airlines services is unfortunate and has inconvenienced many travellers
9130363 as soon as we learned that the airline had ceased operations foreign affairs and international trade canada sent information to our offices abroad concerning the implications for canadian travellers
9130364 additional burdens on the airline industrys fuel costs are undesirable
9130365 weve gone through this in the past the fundamental process of protection has always been in place but weve refined it to be even better as we went along
9130366 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9130367 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such an exaggerated dollar amount it really led us to believe that making a deal was an easier way and would give us the return that we needed for this player
9130368 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender
9130369 he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively
9130370 perhaps most importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defence
9130371 i thought his first year in ottawa was real good i though his last two years left something to be desired
9130372 i was hoping i could convince him to take a contract thats fair and reasonable so he could really develop into the player we hoped he could be but that wasnt in the books
9130373 really quiet but a real good player he can play the point on the power play and shoots the puck really well
9130374 he revved the engine and then gunned it for the sushi place
9130375 you never think he was going right through the window
9130376 the trucks engine was still running and the tires were still spinning

9130378 the city council preaches a business friendly process but thats where it ends
9130379 in my opinion were still dealing with the same issues we were five six years ago
9130380 we get so caught up in the minutiae of what were doing that it takes longer than any other city to get anything done
9130381 we have never opposed certain changes if they were to improve and keep the newspaper alive
9130382 in response to last weekends undeclared strike by some employees
9130383 we had a meeting thursday and we were told the newspaper is closed
9130384 the way things are now the union is firm in its opinion and im firm in mine
9130385 every time they threatened to close it would pull back up again
9130386 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city

9130399 while we still have a long way to go on reaching a new contract we think this action shows good faith on both sides and willingness to move forward together
9130400 the employees strong support including blog and video strikes and other on going mobilization and job actions have played an important part in bringing about this agreement were going to continue to need their support as talks on a new contract continue

9130424 just write my website its about topic a and you can research that on the web
9130425 i like pink and black make a logo out of that
9130426 what the hell is this is this guy serious stop wasting my time
9130427 they have been doing that for a year and they really exposed us they have a nice scheme but we have to play better do what we are supposed to do and just play better everywhere
9130428 i think that is the first full game that i have been a part of at rice with patrick randolph and corbin smiter each getting their first touchdowns that really made my job easier tonight
9130429 the defense made some real big plays tonight to put some points on the board
9130430 instead of hitting the panic button tonight we shifted gears
9130431 when i went on carson dalys show he showed me a tattoo on his ankle that used to say love for jennifer love hewitt
9130432 i saw the first down marker and knew i had two more yards to go then i saw the end zone and took it to another gear
9130433 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9130434 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9130435 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9130436 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9130437 i was actually a little concerned how we were going to start the game
9130438 we didnt practice one day this week because of the tornado but i thought it was pretty important to come out strong on the road
9130439 the kids played hard even though it was a struggle
9130440 josh senegal stepped up and did a real good job and so did david highsmith
9130441 our offensive line really blocked well especially on that big drive
9130442 its a good feeling to be 2 0 but we have a tough schedule and a big game next week against southeast raleigh
9130443 i have worked with him on the football staff for several years and i know of no better young coach
9130444 he is as good a coach as i have ever worked with he demands respect and he demands perfection he has a tremendous rapport with the kids
9130445 we had a nice 90 yard drive but didnt do much offensively or defensively in the first two periods
9130446 our offense started clicking and looked the best it has this year in the second half
9130447 it looked good to look out there and see it moving the ball executing the offense
9130448 he was a big factor in our offensive execution in the second half
9130449 he settled down and ran the offense the offense and the defense really looked good in the second half
9130450 the league looks very strong and we have to get better to compete in this league
9130451 one great thing about traveling is that you do become closer with your teammates
9130452 youre just with them for a whole trip its just you guys that definitely helps the bonding aspect of a team and i think thats going to be beneficial
9130453 being able to start practice now gets the bad taste out of our mouth from last year and look forward to a new year and get up there and play together as a team early on
9130454 we maybe strayed off on different tangents a couple of times
9130455 for the most part last year we were a team but we had some games where some guys went off and did their own things but this year i think we are on the same page
9130456 its a couple days and its just going to be us if we dont get along this trip then weve got some trouble but i think we will
9130457 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him when it comes to stuff like that just to go down there and hear it from him its something i needed to do just to clear my mind
9130458 he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of it was a big relief
9130459 there were a number of tests and josh came through with flying colors
9130460 obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9130461 i was pretty sure i was safe its definitely frustrating it changes the outcome of the game
9130462 it changes the momentum instead of being down 3 2 they get out of the inning soriano comes up and hits a home run now theyre up 3 2
9130463 i dont really want to get into that stuff as far as taking instant replay to every aspect of the game
9130464 were playing good because we feel very confident at home and everybody is healthy
9130465 it was a hard hard decision and i wouldnt even want to represent it as a clear case
9130466 the terrible error in judgment that he made and that somehow some way people would think that we thought that was ok and its not ok
9130467 i suspect that if we had not had the opportunity to work with him first hand that he would not be employed here
9130468 he wasnt hired to be a professional athlete he was hired to be a coach and teacher
9130469 what i did was 100 percent wrong theres no excusing that i know i have an obligation and duty to speak out against the use of banned substances
9130470 we just didnt know how much better eighty two wins is a big moment and i want this to be the standard of what we do to get that number on an annual basis
9130471 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9130472 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9130473 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9130474 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well
9130475 when i put my hand down i feel like a giant out there said the 300 pound sophomore whose team opens the season against mcneese state tonight
9130476 i dont care how big you are how fast you work if youre stronger than me ill outthink you if youre smart ill overpower you if youre fast im going to be quicker than you every time im out there im just going to figure out how to be better than you
9130477 im going to do whatever i can to help my team win
9130478 one of the dreams for me is to turn this thing around to be remembered as one of the guys who helped bring carolina back
9130479 youve got to have that confidence and swagger and the opponent in front of you has no chance
9130480 if youve got that youve already won and youre a step ahead
9130481 when he first got here i was like what in the world kind of monster is this
9130482 but once you got to know marvin hes funny and great to be around and hes a team player who wants this team to go to the acc championship and to bigger things the national championship
9130483 physically me and kentwan were probably on the same level in the weight room last year but he had the knowledge the experience the technique
9130484 just going out there and seeing how he practiced how he took coaching how he interacted with players and coaches and how they loved to be around him it just helped me see what i wanted to become and i where i want to go with my football career
9130485 south johnston really tried to stack it up in the box to start with so that forced us to took to throw more
9130486 morton just did a great job getting the ball to our guys and they just made plays with the ball
9130487 but obviously with that concussion thats probably not the case
9130488 i think we came out a little lackadaisical we looked it on the opening kickoff and missed some tackles
9130489 but then we kind of shored things up and played better we had a really good second half
9130490 and were trying to get to where they are tonight wasnt as much about the score but about the effort weve just got to put this past us and get ready for wakefield well start that monday morning
9130491 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
9130492 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

9130496 hey whats up im if you like what you see hit me up
9130497 does that make him the highest paid sports writer for the sydney morning herald
9130498 it is interesting that the ceo whose knowledge of quality journalism appears to be minimal is offering himself to be a sports writer
9130499 it the launch was meant to be in london but i said no
9130500 i said please can i go to manchester instead i love manchester its got a really good feel to it im really excited about coming back because of course its where i met david
9130501 look we dont have any apple dumplings get the amp over it
9130502 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9130503 if obama ends buying oil from the middle east that will not hurt because we have other markets
9130504 it has not been done in the past and it will not work now
9130505 never be sufficient to compensate for americas huge appetite for oil for a long long time simply because imported oil is an all so essential commodity supporting the us economy
9130506 it would take at least 50 years to implement hassan said
9130507 it has not been done in the past and will not work now
9130508 america has been depending on arab oil for many years paying most often at predetermined rates
9130509 the us went to iraq because of oil it forged special ties with the gulf countries because of oil and it will make no difference if us ends its dependence on middle east oil
9130510 listen girlie it is time to organize and utilize these memories

9130514 functionality that supports a good vibe for instance no tables that require a coaster wine on the furniture no problem
9130515 its amazing how well we did the past couple of years considering how many guys we had that hated football
9130516 there were all stars on our team who absolutely hated coming to the stadium every day
9130517 coach stew treats us like men he shows us respect
9130518 you can go talk to him whenever you want if you tried to go up and have a conversation with coach rod it felt weird and uncomfortable
9130519 a few weeks before coach rodriguez left coach stewart and one of the former assistants who ended up leaving for michigan got into it practice
9130520 he and the other coach were really going at it the main thing i remember is that all of the players gathered around coach stew we had his back and not the other coach
9130521 that said a lot about what this team thinks of him
9130522 west virginians have a feeling and a love for one another thats like no other
9130523 its kind of us against them you know what i mean
9130524 people think were a bunch of hillbillies that live in shacks and trailers well i very proudly spent the first five years of my life in a trailer and someday when i retire ill be back in a trailer if im trailer trash im trailer trash if thats what people think it doesnt bother me
9130525 the 13 3 laptop can last without battery for up to 10 hours after a single recharge
9130526 in federal elections in even years before the primaries and the general elections we are required to make a 60 day mailing notice to all voters in the county telling them about the election and what the id requirements are going to be
9130527 the legislature thought they would help out by offering to pay for the return postage if we would have something printed with that notice something that could be torn off and filled out to request an absentee ballot then we could get grant money or state money as reimbursement for the return postage
9130528 her intepretation was that it was up to the counties
9130529 it all had to be tracked through the postage and we would have to turn in paperwork with an accounting of it which is only reasonable
9130530 but its very complicated its not that we are opposed to doing that its just that it would take more personnel and if it wasnt done right we wouldnt be reimbursed for that money the county would have to eat it
9130531 we received the original letter from the legislature stating it was their intention that all counties would do that dual mailing
9130532 and that was not the way the secretary interpreted it her directive was that it was an optional thing we opted not to do it because of the complicated way of tracking it
9130533 i wasnt aware that the legislature had told brunner that they would go back and allocate more money
9130534 they can come into the office and request an absentee ballot
9130535 or the voter can call the board office and ask for an absentee request form which the board would send to them the board needs certain information and a signature on the request form before a ballot can be issued
9130536 there are lots of candidates and issues in addition to the presidential race this year
9130537 we encourage people who want to vote absentee to get their ballot early so they can review all the choices
9130538 as an added feature theres a lapel cord and button attached so milords hat wont blow away on a windy day
9130539 he left at a point of great fulfillment and great promise
9130540 mr mosel has put together all the way home with tact and understanding
9130541 he has achieved what agee would have approved he has kept the story unvarnished and the people true
9130542 the 13 3 laptop can last without battery for up to 10 hours after a single recharge
9130543 ok then you tell my kids that they cant have hot water because it doesnt make good financial sence to withdrawl the money
9130544 im not sure how were going to do it without technology
9130545 it would take drinking 400 glasses of milk produced with rbst in one day to equal the amount of igf 1 found in your natural saliva
9130546 those organic gurus are now getting to the age for influence
9130547 i think farmers have to do a better job getting the word out
9130548 i think the good thing is we didnt quit but i was pretty disappointed with the way we played especially with the mistakes we made
9130549 at halftime we told the kids play your game dont make the dumb mistakes move the ball and get first downs
9130550 we wanted to try and control the ball and maintain time of possession
9130551 i cant fault their effort and i never would we have to put this game aside and get ready for next week with having newark catholic in week 2 and columbus academy next week we are playing 10 state championships when you talk about toughest schedules in the area i think that ranks right up there
9130552 its good to get that first w of the season
9130553 its a long week of preparation when you lose a game like that tonight couldnt get here fast enough we had worked really hard all week at practice im just happy with how we bounced back
9130554 we wanted to come out and we wanted to finish the little things in the game drives extra points turnovers everything like that we did a much better job controlling things we can control
9130555 when turnovers happen inside of their red zone we need to capitalize on those opportunities and we did
9130556 weve got a lot of backs this year that can spread the wealth were trying to give those guys opportunities to run the ball
9130557 hes 220 pounds and he comes at you from deep in the backfield hes a real hard nosed kid
9130558 thats a goal i think that weve got a pretty good football team if we can get over some of these injuries and stuff i think that we put a pretty good product on the field
9130559 they have one of the best defenses in division iv
9130560 it good was last year and they returned eight guys off that team so i didnt think that they would be any worse we knew it would be tough sledding we knew that we would have to do an outstanding job and i think that the defense did an great job the irish are not a dynamic passing team but they are pretty diverse
9130561 that first one would have been nice to have back
9130562 its just one of those things where any turnover hurt us
9130563 the mistakes we are making come from not being focused on whats going on
9130564 we just need to get some more reps and take care of those problems
9130565 we made some adjustments and were ready to go out and play some good football
9130566 it is a shame the weather put an end to that
9130567 right now we have blown a couple of opportunities and missed a couple of receivers
9130568 weve put the ball on the ground a few times and we have to put a stop to that
9130569 every time we get the ball going we do something to put a stop to that
9130570 we have fumbled two times this game and gave the ball to them after short drives were able to move the ball when we dont make mistakes
9130571 it was a good game for us we played a good game
9130572 we had some big plays which we showed we have the ability to do we got better at running the ball and ran the clock off we did a good job youve got to give them some credit they didnt give up
9130573 we had mental mistakes and we got beat on three plays
9130574 those three plays cost us 21 points ive got to give credit to wooster they did their job in executing and we didnt execute our kids were playing with a lot more intensity this week and we were flying to the football we were doing a lot but we gave those three plays up and that was the difference in the game
9130575 we knew they were playing up and we had run some deeper routes
9130576 we have a lot of speed and sometimes because we are so oriented toward the trip side they fall asleep on the back side on the back side you cant fall asleep our quarterback made some nice throws and we got into some one on one coverage
9130577 it helps to take advantage of the momentum we did that and our defense really set things up too we forced them to play on their end
9130578 i think our kids continued to try but their coach pulled his no 1 kids that was obvious
9130579 that gave us a little bit of a lift im not pulling punches i dont feel good about that in particular but i feel good we didnt give up we have to do that against the no 1s we cant wait and then kick it in gear
9130580 we started off really nice we had some really nice runs but we shot ourselves in the foot a little bit with some penalties
9130581 we never seemed like we got our offense in gear until later in the game
9130582 jordan had a nice night i was pretty happy we have to build on the good things
9130583 abie nathan painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
9130584 its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment
9130585 there was no decision made before the tournament and i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9130586 i was fighting and i wanted so much to win that match she served very well she came to the net many times she was more aggressive than i was
9130587 for me its a special tournament i wanted to play very well here
9130588 she started coming in and i was not able to keep her back or come in myself
9130589 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9130590 it was a good way to finish the series but the indians played well and deserved to win it
9130591 we kept making mistakes throughout and were not consistent in the batting department
9130592 credit goes to the boys for the way we came back in this match
9130593 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years
9130594 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
9130595 ill have a lot more later but needless to say i am positively elated
9130596 anyone who doesnt vote for obama is a racist too
9130597 i take full responsibility for the federal governments response and a year ago i made a pledge that we will learn the lessons of katrina and that we will do what it takes to help you recover
9130598 a written constitution containing suitable restrictions on the powers of government is sufficient of itself without the aid of any organism to counteract the tendency of the numerical majority to oppression and the abuse of power
9130599 the party in possession of the ballot box and the physical force of the country i e the military could be successfully resisted by an appeal to reason truth justice or the obligations imposed by the constitution
9130600 the end of the contest between net taxpayers and tax consumers would be the subversion of the constitution
9130601 the restrictions on state power would ultimately be annulled and the government be converted into one of unlimited powers
9130602 turned to the doctrine of interposition which defended the right of a state to interpose its authority to overrule federal legislation the seeds of this doctrine were introduced by thomas jefferson and james madison in the kentucky and virginia resolutions of 1798 and 1799
9130603 anyone who doesnt vote for obama is a racist too
9130604 it has pulled them out of the acute poverty they were in and the day to day humiliation of working for a landlord
9130605 if we reduce the armed robberies then we will reduce a lot of the homicides
9130606 with young people we used to see in their first introduction to the criminal justice system petty offenses like vandalism then larceny assault and drug dealing before they went on to something like robbery
9130607 im so disgusted with all this talk about raleigh being one of the best places to live thats a lie
9130608 how can you be one of the most attractive places when you dont even take care of your neediest citizens theres an interest in building five star restaurants and skyscrapers but no capacity to build people people are desperate we arent giving them choices
9130609 but we have lost sight of the people and their economic and spiritual condition
9130610 these parents are not raising their children thats the main thing children are out here in the street all times of the night and the parents dont know where they are and where are they getting these guns
9130611 by being aggressive we know we can reduce the number of victims
9130612 our position as a party has always been the more disclosure the better its something that pat takes very seriously we will amend the report
9130613 when donors dont provide complete information we search the internet and other campaign reports if were unable to find information through these avenues we call the donor often multiple times
9130614 there was certainly no secret that these folks work here
9130615 i have a very high regard for both of them
9130616 the obama campaign has spent more in north carolina than anybody has in a long time
9130617 i dont think that the enthusiasm is going to continue
9130618 i believe that 28 to 30 percent of democrats will either choose to stay home or vote for mccain
9130619 the get out the vote effort is going to be unprecedented in the states history
9130620 i think some old line democrats will be hung up on race issues
9130621 but enough new people will be registered to offset that
9130622 most past election years we have been in a defensive posture
9130623 south johnston really tried to stack it up in the box to start with so that forced us to took to throw more
9130624 morton just did a great job getting the ball to our guys and they just made plays with the ball
9130625 but obviously with that concussion thats probably not the case
9130626 the inspector general for the united states department of defense investigated and confirmed the facts related to the fate of the 12 men which led to increased enforcement of anti trafficking measures by the united states
9130627 one great thing about traveling is that you do become closer with your teammates
9130628 youre just with them for a whole trip its just you guys that definitely helps the bonding aspect of a team and i think thats going to be beneficial
9130629 being able to start practice now gets the bad taste out of our mouth from last year and look forward to a new year and get up there and play together as a team early on
9130630 we maybe strayed off on different tangents a couple of times
9130631 for the most part last year we were a team but we had some games where some guys went off and did their own things but this year i think we are on the same page
9130632 its a couple days and its just going to be us if we dont get along this trip then weve got some trouble but i think we will

9130656 there were times when id cover up and id go home and cry because i really wanted to be there and i didnt know what the heck i was doing
9130657 i was just sleeping one day in the summer in july and i felt it was something with god
9130658 coach ullery told me i had to earn my way back and the team had to vote me back on because i had missed so much running i remember each day having to run until i dang near puked but thats what i wanted to do id do whatever i could to get back on the team i thank the team for voting me back because i wouldnt be in this position if they didnt
9130659 he can get up and down the line of scrimmage he can chase things from behind and yet hes strong enough to be a force at the point of attack youve got to have an anchor in the middle and hes our anchor
9130660 hes developed into a real leader on our football team i think early on greg was a really shy guy or reserved but now you can see the leadership coming out of him
9130661 greg was always a good kid but he never would take things quite as seriously as he should
9130662 he thought things would work out for him without making a commitment when he came back he was a lot more mature a lot more motivated and saw he could go some places if he wanted to
9130663 its growing pains we dont know how to win yet
9130664 were a young football team and were learning we just dont want to learn this way
9130665 were trying to figure it out on offense right now
9130666 were waiting for one of them to step up and take the position they havent done it yet
9130667 you dont want to play a game like that but when your kids respond in that situation youve got to be happy
9130668 i thought fairfields kids responded too both teams should be proud of how they played
9130669 were just trying to get in position to give the kicker a chance
9130670 we have to learn how to take care of the football
9130671 carlisle is a good team and we were concerned coming in
9130672 but you have to gain some momentum any way you can sometimes you do it yourself and sometimes they do it for you
9130673 how could you be happy after that if it could go wrong for us it did hopefully weve got it all out of our system now
9130674 it was all mental errors and thats on us as coaches to keep that from happening
9130675 to be honest i didnt think we played that well offensively
9130676 carlisle is a big play team and our defense knew what they were in for with that our defense came out and hit hard and established a great deal of confidence for us
9130677 our linemen all i can say is i love them thats it i love them
9130678 i thought the defense did a nice job and played with heart
9130679 holding that lehman team to 14 points is pretty good but our offense just didnt perform tonight
9130680 we had a real good pass rush which is something we didnt have last week
9130681 so we did get better on defense thats big for us
9130682 we just felt that we had a shot at doing that
9130683 we didnt want to take the ball away from returner frank desico either but we wanted to take a shot early
9130684 especially with them being the away team that gave them some momentum right off the bat
9130685 in the first half we ran 31 plays to their 17 and outgained them 84 yards to 80 and were still down 10 3 because we cant punt thats a big frustration
9130686 hopefully we can move on in the cup because last weekend really hurt a cup run would do us the world of good and there will be changes because i wont be putting up for that again
9130687 we had them watched and it will be quite hard up there so we have got to be switched on because those sorts of games can haunt you i think the lads are very professional but you never know in the fa cup thats what makes it so good
9130688 we responded to some serious adversity falling behind early after coughing up two fumbles
9130689 we found out a lot about our team with this performance
9130690 he was cleared to play just today and i wasnt sure if he was ready to go
9130691 but as the game wore on he became our spark
9130692 when i went around the corner for that first 76 yard score i could just feel that this was the start of something big
9130693 the credit goes to my line and thats all i can say about that they opened big holes and i was able to break through them i couldnt have done this without them
9130694 i want my ball to go long and hit the pins hard

9130714 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9130715 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9130716 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9130717 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9130718 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9130719 you guys kept me in there when i was losing my head
9130720 if this crowd comes with me the whole way who knows
9130721 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9130722 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9130723 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9130724 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9130725 this is like a minature vacuum cleaner im going to suck them all up and take them away

9130753 it may not be on the cutting edge technically but castle crashers trademark 2d style is definitely the glue that binds this quirky package together eyes bug out and heads fly with a looney tunes cartoon macabre and the crisp sprites and smooth animations look great in fluorescent hd paired with the soundtracks epic scores and techno tinged battle themes castle crashers presentation is undoubtedly a notch up from most downloadable games whether crashing castles or the dusty corners of your nostalgia these little guys score big the gameplay is addictive and the self referential material is charming it also manages to hit the sweet spot between accessibility and depth that we expect from top shelf downloadable games it isnt too often that you see a good retro themed game hit the market and castle crashers is just that

9130772 there is a municipality motivated polarization and discrimination in the region which was almost divided into two sections where the leftists including alevis are gathered and where the akp electorate lived

9130823 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9130824 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9130825 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9130826 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9130827 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9130828 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9130829 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9130830 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9130831 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9130832 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9130833 i was grateful to have all those months to prepare
9130834 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9130835 i have people that live over there in downtown and they were looking at using those stairs
9130836 and now theyre screwed and this is the first im hearing of it
9130837 the republican national convention is an event of global significance and with that status comes some inconveniences weve worked hard to minimize the inconveniences to residents and visitors
9130838 palins 4 month old daughter who has down syndrome is actually the baby of her 17 year old moms is actually a grandmoms look it out there talk about social conservative values
9130839 danke f r alles was gute musik unter die leute bringt
9130840 that would give us a better chance at buying a house too if i dont have to have as many school loans to pay back
9130841 youve got low income families and unemployment rates are high from what i can see its needed for people to be able to get above that poverty line
9130842 we definitely saw a need there and knew this was something the community wanted but we didnt anticipate the market to behave the way it did
9130843 now the question were faced with is are we going to turn away minneapolis folks just because they live on the wrong side of the river
9130844 its like i have a football field behind me expecting me to finish
9130845 what you see is what you get shes very upfront
9130846 between biden obama and mccain palin is the only one who can spell energy the rest of these guys are completely clueless
9130847 she has shown an independent streak and has been anything but a patsy in dealing with the oil industry in alaska
9130848 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9130849 simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9130850 they dont have big color pictures of sarah palin in the board rooms of bp conocophillips or exxon
9130851 if shes in the pocket of big oil shes kept it a pretty good secret
9130852 its a good partnership if you consider having to sue your partner constantly to pay you a good thing
9130853 she has stood up to the big players when she didnt like the process and i dont think its played well with the industry
9130854 the agenda of alaska and the agenda of exxon are not always the same
9130855 they may both want more production but it may not be under the same terms
9130856 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar hero movie
9130857 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts
9130858 i dont think a hillary person would ever move to her based on the issues
9130859 i dont think before today i would have ever heard someone call her a feminist
9130860 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
9130861 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
9130862 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
9130863 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
9130864 the numbers released today show the potential power of public insurance programs to provide desperately needed coverage to uninsured americans
9130865 the supreme court upheld mexico citys abortion law by an 8 to 3 vote on thursday allowing unrestricted abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy
9130866 since the citys legislature voted for the law in april 2007 some 85 percent of the gynecologists in the citys public hospitals have declared themselves conscientious objectors
9130867 and women complain that even at those hospitals that perform abortions staff members are often hostile demeaning them and throwing up bureaucratic hurdles
9130868 making it easier for transsexuals and transgender people to legally change their names and obtain revised birth certificates that reflect their gender identification
9130869 a new anti abortion group has its sights set beyond just running ads and launching viral internet attacks on barack obama the group wants to overturn the federal election law that could rein in not only its own activities but those of any so called issue advocacy groups
9130870 on labor day weekend consider this as many as 43 percent of american workers in private industry dont have paid sick days according to 2007 data from the federal government if they call in sick they lose their pay and sometimes their jobs
9130871 that number has risen over the years part of a larger trend to cut back on sick leave among workers who do still have the once venerable benefit many have found their days reduced or lumped together as part of their vacation time the united states unique among industrialized countries doesnt mandate a minimum number of paid sick days for workers
9130872 theres no way in hell im going to be able sit through four years of this type of public speaking
9130873 for all of you who are barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen take time out whatever it is you people do and vote for me i gave you what you wanted i gave you someone who sits down to pee as a running mate i dont really know much about her on account of the fact she lives up there in alaska and quite frankly between you and me im surprised shes not one of them eskimos or canadians but for all of you who are cheesed off that you didnt get to vote for hillary i showed you i can pretend to care about whatever it is you people call values so come on over to the grand ol party now vote for me damn it
9130874 i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9130875 ive been made theyre tailing me ive finished this laser its in the safe house but they know who i am
9130876 youre in detention youve been sentenced to 10 days in chongwen
9130877 cherbourg peut se vanter de poss der la plus grande la plus belle la plus moderne la mieux outill e des gare maritime non seulement de notre vieux continent mais du monde entier
9130878 when mallika was shooting in kerala she heard about the habitat technology group and asked their ceo to design a hut cottage for her near kovalam beach its 600 square feet in size is made of mud bamboo lime and jaggery a type of masala mortar and follows traditional and vernacular idioms of kerala these huts cost anywhere between rs 3 to 6 lakh
9130879 mallika is expected to arrive in the next few days and give the final approval to complete her home the hut is on a hill and one has to reach the place on foot as it doesnt have a motorable road
9130880 der ist f r die n chsten zw lf monate total ausgebucht

9130883 gonna take you in the closet and make you suck his dick

9130885 so stand pat sit on your hands better safe than sorry
9130886 whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
9130887 governor palin brings another strong pro life voice to the republican ticket in sharp contrast to the pro abortion ticket of barack obama and joe biden
9130888 between an avowed pro abortion ticket that would continue to push for unrestricted abortion on demand and a strongly pro life ticket that will bring us closer to a society that embraces the value and dignity of human life
9130889 governor palin will change the dynamics of the entire presidential race
9130890 her admirable record of confronting corruption and living her pro life convictions shows she is a doer not just a talker sarah palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate and not simply because shes a woman but because shes a woman of substance and character
9130891 it is particularly significant that a conservative woman was nominated for the nations second highest office
9130892 for years the feminist movement has acknowledged for leadership only those women who embrace a radical agenda how refreshing that now we have a woman who reflects the values of mainstream american women sarah palin is pro life pro marriage and pro family she is a woman who is balancing the personal and professional in admirable ways she is an outstanding woman who will be an excellent role model for the nations young people sarah palin is chief among equals with american professional women she brings the kind of balance that characterizes the high achieving women of today she will bring to the forefront of our cultural conversations an intelligent realistic well grounded womans perspective
9130893 personnel is policy with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment
9130894 the selection of gov palin means that this upcoming election will be historic but beyond making history palin brings substance and excitement she is intelligent young attractive and articulate as a woman and a mother she can attract women voters particularly those who feel disenfranchised
9130895 sarah palin is the whole package women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9130896 i hate to be a cynic but it smacks of how do i get my tour opening night in the news during the democratic convention
9130897 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
9130898 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
9130899 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat politics
9130900 better yet put me in office make me your vice president hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant
9130901 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
9130902 yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped ball up all of his speeches and just throw em like candy wrap
9130903 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
9130904 it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves
9130905 john daniel momma says we have to stay in our room
9130906 momma are we doing a good job were staying in our room like you asked us to do
9130907 children we are here preparing to meet the lord as the end of our life approaches he wants us to love one another and to share
9130908 i have no silver and gold but i give you what i have in the name of jesus christ of nazareth walk
9130909 you can never get enough of what you dont really want
9130910 this is my body an evangelical discovers the real presence
9130911 behold your mother an evangelical discovers the blessed virgin mary
9130912 hey you got plenty of stomach to block those balls belly
9130913 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
9130914 we are opposed any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right to an abortion
9130915 democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
9130916 access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives
9130917 help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
9130918 if you use a condom or take a pill you have nothing to fear
9130919 pro choice opinion leaderslike planned parenthood and naral have been talking about the importance of reducing the number of abortions in america for decades
9130920 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
9130921 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me
9130922 you are thinking not as god does but as human beings do
9130923 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
9130924 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
9130925 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority these human rights belong to human nature and are inherent in the person from the moment of conception until death
9130926 formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense the church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life
9130927 those who are excommunicated and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion
9130928 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion

9130968 as with any disease the most effective public health strategy to combat hiv aids is to identify those who are infected provide treatment and minimize the spread of new infections ab 1894 will help us identify more people who are already living with hiv but who may not know their status because theyve never been tested hiv is a treatable but not curable infection with the lifetime cost of care for just one individual living with hiv aids now estimated at more than 600 000 we need to do everything possible to normalize the process for hiv testing in order to identify all those who are infected link them to treatment and reduce the spread of new infections

9130995 concerns we in the common cause partnership have about the proposals of the windsor continuation group nonetheless it is disturbing to discover that at least one member of the wcg a body that is supposed to be working for reconciliation in the anglican communion so quickly leaked private correspondence in an attempt to gain some passing political advantage

9131001 now church gay caucuses seem overjoyed to be bought out by secular lobbying groups in this collaboration political activist want to use the church to promote causes alien to the churches life and faith and the church gay caucuses enthusiastically collaborate at a time when mainline denominations writhe in self defeating conflict this well funded political pressure is poisonous
9131002 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
9131003 delegates passed three resolutions by overwhelming majorities which included affirming the gafcon process pledging cana to the common cause partnership supporting common cause leading eventually to becoming an orthodox anglican province in north america and thirdly welcoming a number of new churches in the ohio michigan indiana area as the
9131004 the first the anglican district of virginia was officially welcomed into cana last december more districts will follow as gatherings of churches mobilize together for mission and outreach
9131005 cana is definitely gaining momentum when we met last december there were about sixty parishes in cana now we have over seventy with ten more working toward mission church status we expect 100 cana congregations by the end of the year over 150 people parish clergy church planters and non parochial have become cana clergy
9131006 over 100 worshipers of every background and nationality spent two hours praising god in a wonderful blend of anglican liturgy and charismatic freedom
9131007 worship was at the center of the council we glorified god utilizing liturgies from the prayer books of several nations
9131008 cana worships our lord with great enthusiasm out of that worship comes a desire to work for the kingdom of god by bringing new life in christ to people and by caring for them in all extremes locally and worldwide word and action in the work we witness to what the risen christ is doing in our lives and in our congregations

9131020 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
9131021 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
9131022 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
9131023 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn
9131024 to lock everyone into aporn bucket makes people who have alternate privacy needs think that theyre doing something wrong
9131025 we want users to not only be able to enter a private browsing session but tell the browser that they want to delete all evidence starting a couple of hours ago
9131026 the key part is getting privacy tools into the browser
9131027 rather than as add ons or extensions microsofts announcement is significant not because its a major technological breakthrough but because its a breakthrough into making it easier for users to have real control over their privacy
9131028 but well have to wait to see how easy it is to use
9131029 what were seeing in firefox is that people want their browsers to remember more not less

9131037 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9131038 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9131039 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9131040 it takes some physical strength to do but you also have to be a good tactician and have a local knowledge

9131046 i brought out a couple buckets for people watching with me because we bout tossed our cookies and the speech hadnt even started yet
9131047 i was honestly hoping for a speech like the one i remember he delivered in springfield in sub zero temperature
9131048 that was a phenomenal speech not that id ever vote for the guy im pro life and hes extremely pro abortion but it was a great speech he delivered in springfield
9131049 i suppose after months of campaigning and chummin up with the clintons bidens and durbins its not washington that rubs off its a distorted perspective of reality that sinks in
9131050 i suppose i should stop being amazed that millions of americans are drinking the kool aid the partys serving up en masse but the death of amazement and outrage leads to loss of hope
9131051 too bad complaining about the hubris and set architecture wont change the fact that conservatives have got an uphill battle ahead the only solution is getting conservatives out to vote on november 4th or this countrys in deep

9131054 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
9131055 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
9131056 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
9131057 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start

9131096 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9131097 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9131098 preterm premature babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
9131099 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
9131100 the commerzbank board would not hold negotiations that it did not think it could finance
9131101 but i think its important to have certain milestones that youre trying to achieve to have certain work that youre trying to finish even if you know that the conclusion of for instance the us india civil nuclear deal would not be the end of moving the us indian relationship forward
9131102 well do more work on that the next secretary of state will and so will the next secretary of state
9131103 but if you can conclude something like that youve pushed it to the next level and im always looking for the work that you can conclude to push something to the next level push your relationship to the next level
9131104 we set out at the beginning to try and improve extend broaden and deepen the us india relationship because very early on the president george w bush and i both saw it as an emerging big democracy and the relationships never been very close
9131105 and you can do all of the kind of small things you know not small things but expected new agricultural cooperation new cooperation between businesses
9131106 but the 800 pound elephant in the room was could we overcome the nuclear cooperation barrier that has existed ever since the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty india not signing the npt and india being a nuclear weapons state
9131107 and so setting out to do that then puts the relationship on a completely different level
9131108 and when people talk about landmark agreements i think thats really what theyre talking about
9131109 we really started pursuing the india civil nuclear deal in 2005 so there was a period of getting to know the relationship and building on what had been there before
9131110 but i think we knew from 2001 2002 that eventually that was going to have to be an issue but we built to it slowly it didnt start with the big stepwise function
9131111 youre not going to get anyplace in negotiating with an adversary
9131112 and so you keep you lay you make certain that youve got the sticks constantly in place
9131113 not when youre negotiating with germany or even russia which isnt an adversary now or negotiating with india even negotiating with china
9131114 but i think its important to have certain milestones that youre trying to achieve to have certain work that youre trying to finish even if you know that the conclusion of for instance the us india civil nuclear deal would not be the end of moving the us indian relationship forward
9131115 well do more work on that the next secretary of state will and so will the next secretary of state

9131332 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
9131333 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
9131334 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
9131335 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
9131336 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9131337 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
9131338 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
9131339 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
9131340 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
9131341 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
9131342 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
9131343 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
9131344 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
9131345 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
9131346 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
9131347 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
9131348 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
9131349 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
9131350 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
9131351 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
9131352 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
9131353 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
9131354 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9131355 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9131356 well you see im doing a consumer satisfaction interview of sorts its been broadened out to include a wide variety of oh itll only take a moment i promise
9131357 condime what what kind of interview is this who is it for anyway who are you
9131358 you see i was going to get in a debate of sorts
9131359 you know youre really taking it much better than everyone else did congratulations
9131360 even monsters deserve to be remembered ill make sure that you are ill make sure that you crimes are known death will not end your tale
9131361 death has played its part in my life and im still alive indeed death has not been the end of my tale how very astute of you
9131362 but you seem to be under the impression that youll be killing me for a second time 1 minute ago tonight that would be where you are incorrect love
9131363 holy objects only work when theyve been blessed recently by priests my heart if you cant tell is already dead stab me and ill bleed yes but nothing severe would happen even if you did manage to somehow reach my heart with that twig it wouldnt do much
9131364 i fear that i am not as respectful as you love
9131365 i cannot control things and must learn to accept what is
9131366 i was in the middle of our morning newscast when the producers said in my ear that it was going to be her
9131367 i just said hold on to your seat folks john mccain has chosen governor palin as his running mate nobody seriously thought it would happen
9131368 its just taken all of us in the state aback
9131369 palin seems to have grown into the role of governor in her first speech to the legislature we all remarked at how nervous she seemed
9131370 interestingly in her vp acceptance speech today she came off as significantly more confident
9131371 as governor palin seemed to speak more in generalities when it came to questions of policy
9131372 she usually deferred a lot of the policy questions to her staff she still does that today
9131373 she certainly brings with her the enthusiasm and energy with both her status and age she would represent the everyday person
9131374 she is capable very energetic proud and i think she is very sharp plus she is pretty well versed in areas of energy
9131375 theres been a buzz around alaska but i was surprised she was on the short list
9131376 it is a proud day for alaska we bring a lot to the table for the rest of the country
9131377 she was a very strong administrator for the city of wasilla during her time she reduced property tax by 75
9131378 this is a surprise its a surprise to all of us
9131379 obama has made such a concerted effort in alaska setting up offices throughout the state mccain doesnt even have an office in alaska and he has never mentioned campaigning here
9131380 california is the most liberal state in the union no joke that place is probably going to slide into the ocean one of these days california is a wasteland run by liberals
9131381 california is the most liberal state in the union no joke that place is probably going to slide into the ocean one of these days california is a wasteland run by liberals
9131382 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
9131383 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
9131384 california is the most liberal state in the union no joke that place is probably going to slide into the ocean one of these days california is a wasteland run by liberals
9131385 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
9131386 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
9131387 california is the most liberal state in the union no joke that place is probably going to slide into the ocean one of these days california is a wasteland run by liberals
9131388 his changeup is top of the scale his curveball is above average his fastball hits 88 92 mph and he has good control
9131389 over the past few years ive had an uncomfortable feeling that someone or something has been tinkering with my brain remapping the neural circuitry reprogramming the memory
9131390 we are not only what we read we are how we read
9131391 pancake people spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button
9131392 we dont have work days we have work minutes that last all day
9131393 average amount of time that people spent on any single event before being interrupted or before switching was three minutes and five seconds on average
9131394 it kills your brain cells son it kills your brain cells
9131395 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
9131396 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
9131397 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9131398 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
9131399 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
9131400 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
9131401 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
9131402 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one
9131403 were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
9131404 my own sister to me she was murdered by doctors
9131405 she was having a baby in the bronx and they gave her an epidural a normal procedure that was supposed to numb her from the waist down they numbed her from the waist up because they had amateurs learning in the bronx hospitals not even real doctors students murdered my sister in the inner city in the bronx i love what barack is doing with the heath care system once he gets universal health care for everybody then we gotta step up our system to make it the best in the world
9131406 not war everybody had jobs the economy was growing george bush and the republicans turned the whole country around to where our dollar is worth half the euro dollar your man john mccain wants to continue the same tactics of the bush organization why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
9131407 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush
9131408 years ago you would go overseas and the people would praise you and love the united states i feel barack obama is the one person who could bring not just the united states but the world together i was in africa two days ago and i seen people with i love obama on their bumper sticker he just spoke to 200 000 people in germany
9131409 we have to vote and change this country around everybody has to get out there and register im not asking im telling you to go vote im forcing you
9131410 what a shame this guy is refering to daddy yankee
9131411 perbezaan di antara puasa kami dengan puasa ahli kitab yahudi dan nasrani ialah adanya makan sahur
9131412 sesungguhnya allah dan malaikatnya mengucapkan selawat berdoa dan memohon daripada allah akan keampunan dan keredaan ke atas orang yang bersahur
9131413 sentiasa umatku dalam kebaikan selama mereka mahu bersegera berbuka puasanya dan mengakhirkan makan sahurnya
9131414 kami pernah bersahur bersama nabi kemudian kami bangun untuk melakukan solat subuh
9131415 berapa lama masa antara kedua duanya yakni antara makan sahur dan solat subuh
9131416 katakanlah mahukah aku khabarkan kepadamu apa yang lebih baik daripada yang demikian itu bagi mereka yang bertakwa ada syurga di sisi tuhan mereka yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai mereka kekal dalamnya mereka juga dikurniakan isteri isteri yang suci serta mendapat keredaan allah dan allah maha melihat akan hamba hamba nya iaitu orang yang berdoa ya tuhan kami sesungguhnya kami telah beriman maka ampunilah dosa kami dan peliharalah kami daripada seksa neraka merekalah orang yang sabar yang benar yang taat yang menafkahkan hartanya di jalan allah dan yang memohon ampun pada waktu sahur
9131417 i use to go i grew up going 3 5 times a week but i had enough and some bad experiences with it so i no longer go
9131418 seems like that happens i never went to church until i was went on my own when i was in my 20s and was saved
9131419 a set of interpersonal competencies built on specific neural circuits and related endocrine systems that inspire others to be effective
9131420 these cells are peppered throughout the brain and are programed to mimic the emotions of others followers look for cues from their leaders and not only mimic their behaviors consciously but also subconsciously the discovery of
9131421 coordinate people physically by regulating how and when their bodies move together
9131422 conformity is one of the nihilistic temptations of rebellion which dominate a large part of our intellectual history it demonstrates how the rebel who takes to action is tempted to succumb if he forgets his origins to the most absolute conformity and so explains the twentieth century
9131423 apa saja persiapan yang sudah dilakukan sebagai persiapan diri menghadapi bulan ramadhan
9131424 usc michigan are big games but i am most looking forward to illinois theres some revenge needed when we head there
9131425 weve had a good solid camp the guys have worked hard
9131426 obviously weve been at it for a while we need to hit a different color jersey
9131427 they have a good tailback david mccarty who rushed for over 1 500 yards
9131428 their quarterback vinny esposito 154 of 277 1 810 passing yards 12 touchdowns is back and they have three of their starters on the offensive line returning theyre 11 2 in the last two years in their conference and they beat delaware 17 10 at tubby raymond field two years ago so we know we have our work cut out
9131429 its status quo other than john ihne has solidified the fifth man on the offensive line at the guard position
9131430 we feel like the core of the team has showed up in good shape and now its time to go play
9131431 i just told the guys you just have to go out and play coaches teach and demand and players prepare and perform its that simple
9131432 hes got great feet great balance hes going to be tough and hell be as good as we face so weve got to prepare for the best and see what happens
9131433 and their quarterback julian edelman is a very talented kid he can do a lot of things running and throwing the ball so weve got our hands full
9131434 you know jarvis is a legitimate running back because he sees cuts that are hard to even see on film hes really patient behind his blockers and he knows what hes doing thats the easiest way to put it hes patient he sees the hole and its hard to see him
9131435 doug martin will try to go over the top hell throw four post routes
9131436 thats just the philosophy of his offense hell do a lot of quick stuff too
9131437 im a patient man im not going anywhere key said
9131438 my stay in iraq has opened my eyes to just how brutal a country we are we came into this country like a football player back handing a 2 year old for his lollipop we left nothing untouched that had even the slightest effect on the outcome of the war weapons of mass destruction yeah right whatever george
9131439 let it rain for 40 days gods will be done
9131440 you wish one of those would pop just to see him in the real open field and the chance to run away
9131441 w e can be slow as well to give greatness its due a mistake i made myself long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in arizona
9131442 and if they had been the more reflective kind our enemies would have understood that the cause of dr king was bigger than any one man and could not be stopped by force of violence
9131443 white peoples perceptions of black equality and progress are curious and at every so called historical racial breakthrough must be documented can you imagine for example calling baracks nomination racial progress
9131444 since we are on the frontline when the tides of the economic change we have to be able to monitor the real market very closely
9131445 this pushes us to be very vigilant and to be able to sense what is going to happen in the market before it happens
9131446 as part of the legal requirements instituted in 2005 we had to change the name to bank asya along with four other participation banks in turkey
9131447 nothing changed in terms of the operation and functioning of the bank the principle of interest free banking is still at the core of the modus operandi
9131448 those are just rumors implanted to curtail the growth of the sector
9131449 considering only four participation banks exist among a total of 50 banks in turkey this is a sizable portion of the market
9131450 the system is based on loss and profit and there is no predetermined rate of return on your investment you might get your share of loss if say the leasing of machinery is lost and cant be recouped by the bank
9131451 for example we were offering 2 5 percent profit loss share on foreign currency deposits in 2002 while other conventional banks were providing 25 to 30 percent of interest rate to their consumers that is almost tenfold of what we were able to offer
9131452 turkey will become the most important economy in the region and participation banks will play a role in that growth
9131453 we are in the real economy and our lending policies contribute to the growth of the economy by adding a positive value every step of the way
9131454 they use their savings to pay most of the home price when buying houses and use credit for the rest
9131455 is the countrys stability and general economic outlook just like other financial institutions and banks we would like to see what is ahead as the market does not like uncertainties
9131456 whoever convinces the public through fair and free democratic elections gets the mandate to rule the government
9131457 we do not need to part ways with the imf we can look for standby agreements that are not binding on the government but that will serve as an important anchor for the economy it will enhance our standing in international markets
9131458 the government can still borrow money from private financial institutions
9131459 forty million credit cards have been issued in turkey and this is not high when you compare it to a population of 70 million the second largest in europe after germany
9131460 the default rate is around 7 percent right now which is a very tolerable number
9131461 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington mccain sturgis sturgis news
9131462 no hemos podido completar su pedido de itunes store se agoto el tiempo de espera de la conexion de red
9131463 one day to be nice and one day to be ruin
9131464 la redenci n de un dios que hab a dejado de hacer milagros
9131465 no porque sea trash al final es bueno sigue siendo metallica la banda fracasada de los noventas
9131466 la gente se muere y el equipo de metallica tambien lo hicimos como un tributo hacia ellos que se convirtieron en una clase de m rtires
9131467 lol nub yes it will it works on the psp lolololol
9131468 shut up your rong lawl you dont know what your talking about lololloloar zodttd has to work on meh wii emulator
9131469 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9131470 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9131471 this is the law that would make it at the supreme court if planned parenthood assaults this law in south dakota we are ready there is money being raised for the legal costs to fight this all the way
9131472 one of our co chairs is a republican and the other is democrat
9131473 it is reasonable to expect it to win on the ballot
9131474 the court challenges by planned parenthood will likely begin sometime that november and would reach the
9131475 the u s supreme court will most likely have the best make up for an abortion bill when the case reaches the supreme court in 2011 or 2012 than any court is likely to have in the next ten or fifteen years
9131476 as for that vp talk all the time i tell you i still cant answer that question until someone answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9131477 it undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9131478 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation
9131479 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9131480 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9131481 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9131482 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9131483 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9131484 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9131485 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9131486 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9131487 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9131488 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9131489 i think the hospital district board should look at it immediately and consult with the county attorney and figure out what the problems have been and solve them
9131490 i just would advise people not to pay any medical bills till they get the statement from the insurance company from a medical standpoint i just try to go to the best doctor we can get
9131491 people think of themselves as consumers when they go out to the store to buy
9131492 but they dont necessarily think of themselves as consumers with any rights when they go through the doors to the doctors office or with other kinds of rights like insurance
9131493 if you are going to shop for a car you are going to check out more than one
9131494 and so with doctors you might want to get more than one opinion and dont take the first name that comes along especially if its a serious illness because hes a friend of your neighbors
9131495 and the orthopedist wants all of their money up front before they even begin to work on your prosthesis
9131496 if you know your child has asthma for example do your research it is important to find the right doctor
9131497 its almost comical because we both want the epa to act
9131498 we dont have a full understanding why epa hasnt acted
9131499 when we look around at what the epa has approved in other states texas rules meet the benchmarks
9131500 a vehicle for epa to rubber stamp deficient texas air permitting rules
9131501 weve just been in this limbo because no one at epa has acted on it
9131502 industry could get a schedule for epa to act from its lawsuit and thats good but were also saying these rules are problems that need to be fixed
9131503 we dont want to end up marooned like one of those bad episodes of gilligans island
9131504 but that hurricane is the white elephant in the room
9131505 weve got 65 signed up and expecting 100 at tryouts
9131506 weve never been in a hurricane but we dont plan to stay if they tell us to evacuate
9131507 wed heard that the hurricane may not come this far and impact this area so were going to try it and see
9131508 come monday we could be looking at some big surf
9131509 alcohol is a big concern this time of year because this is the last big recreational weekend of the summer
9131510 it removes any pretense of a neutral magistrate and an objective ruling
9131511 the good news is weve got some good talented young statewide leaders i dont know whether theyre ready to run statewide in 2010 or not
9131512 youre going to see a lot of people think more seriously about running for statewide office
9131513 im not as worried about the talent as being diligent in building the groundwork for a solid base
9131514 my favorite one of course and i dont know if its going to take her a short time or a long time is senator van de putte
9131515 i doubt that he can raise the money for a major statewide race you lose too many times and it makes it hard to raise statewide money
9131516 its time for new blood thats not to say you wont see people my age running but this is really a generational change
9131517 we have a better bench than the republicans and its all in the state house of representatives
9131518 if you look at the relative youth of our house delegation as compared to the republican i would say most of the talent is on the democratic side
9131519 im very bullish about the future of the texas democratic party
9131520 its going to take an election cycle or two but we are going to have some very compelling candidates to offer up as we turn this state blue
9131521 a compelling person with a terrific personal story im sure that she will help make the case for republicans
9131522 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies
9131523 i think you just figured out why i chose joe biden
9131524 because heres a man who wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth
9131525 one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling
9131526 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9131527 the only way he doesnt receive cases is if hes no longer a judge
9131528 after all hes presumed innocent thats how we work around here
9131529 judge samuel kent is a predator and needs to be prosecuted for the immoral and criminal acts he has committed
9131530 had concerns about taking her complaint to a higher level and the stress that it would cause everyone but after discussing the situation with us she realized she needed to step up to the plate in order to protect other women
9131531 our biggest worry is that this is a long holiday weekend
9131532 a lot of people are still trying to make plans and all i can tell them is that if it starts heading this way know that well be prepared locally as for you and your personal situation youll have to make a decision
9131533 the issue is that the models are kind of all over the place
9131534 the potential to be a powerful storm is there were still in the cone of error weve got to plan as if its coming here were trying to be conservative about it we want to be careful about unduly alarming people
9131535 we will continue to ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate so we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9131536 they are making sure all of the major items are stored and packed away and sent to remote locations
9131537 while its certainly possible that gustav could make landfall in another state we need folks to be ready
9131538 if we lose power or if fuel is sent to support evacuation efforts even folks on the dry side of the storm will want to have a full tank
9131539 this reinforces that sen mccain wants to be the independent reformer change ticket hes not ceding that to sen obama
9131540 the fact that the womens vote is up for grabs did make a strong woman a plus on the ticket
9131541 i was so startled that i just got up and walked out
9131542 james blackstock not only disgraced himself and his family while subjecting numerous women myself included to unwarranted humiliation and assault over the years but he tainted the bench from which he sat and violated the trust placed in him by the public
9131543 they felt they couldnt do anything because of his powerful position
9131544 we are a high growth state that needs a lot of highway miles and we dont need to be subsidizing other states
9131545 even by d c standards its pure fantasy and texans need real solutions
9131546 well let me just end by saying that i appreciate everything that youve said
9131547 you can put me down as shocked and surprised and like ok why
9131548 said rey trevi o 51 a democratic delegate from lytle
9131549 just because she palin is a woman doesnt mean shes a candidate for us
9131550 a small percentage of hillary supporters might be engaged in supporting the woman just because she is a woman
9131551 but overall people who supported hillary because of her ideals supported her because they were democratic ideals not because she is a woman
9131552 we had geraldine ferraro as our vice presidential pick in 1984 at least she was a congresswoman and everyone knew who she was
9131553 you do have a candidate who is 72 years of age and a vice presidential candidate who is literally one heartbeat away

9131557 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfill her desires

9131592 obama felt no need to use his vp pick to rally the base and unite his party biden was picked precisely because obama felt he was the best pick for the ticket not because he needed to mollify one group or another

9131616 addressing the problem of violent crime in the community requires a holistic approach

9131624 we are attempting to prove deliberation in a way that hasnt been tried in this state
9131625 but at the end of the day another court is going to have to make that decision

9131627 there are people who want blood its going to be controversial
9131628 but if any of you is ill or on a journey the same number should be made up from other days
9131629 when this aayah was revealed and as for those who can fast with difficulty e g an old man they have a choice either to fast or to feed a miskeen poor person for every day al baqarah 2 184 interpretation of the meaning those who wanted not to fast could do that and pay the fidyah i e feed one poor person for each day that remained the case until the following aayah was revealed i e the verse and as for those who can fast with difficulty e g an old man they have a choice either to fast or to feed a miskeen poor person for every day al baqarah 2 185 interpretation of the meaning so it abrogated it
9131630 and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days which one did not observe sawm fasts must be made up from other days
9131631 allaah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer and he has relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting
9131632 and as for those who can fast with difficulty e
9131633 and all of you beg allaah to forgive you all o believers that you may be successful

9131638 do not anticipate ramadaan by fasting one or two days before it begins but if a man habitually fasts then let him fast
9131639 do not anticipate ramadaan by fasting one or two days before it begins but if a man habitually fasts then let him fast
9131640 whoever fasts on the day concerning which there is doubt has disobeyed peace and blessings of allaah be upon him

9131643 and then you would think of me as a liar
9131644 you just choose the way that insults me the most
9131645 that i found someone i like alot who lives close by
9131646 think about it who would go through the effort to do this just to make you angry enough to break your silence
9131647 are you going to play or will you be the adult and stick to your guns
9131648 but its immature and if shes sinking to that level with her boy toy then let her youre better then that
9131649 i was almost as bad only i openly said it instead of pulling up false bullshit
9131650 but youre smarter then them now use that wonderful head of yours and stay away from the bullshit

9131657 weve been playing good baseball it seems like for the better part of three months its frustrating we didnt play better the first two months
9131658 im just trying to get a ball that i can hit in the air
9131659 he left it out over the plate and i got a pretty good swing on it
9131660 this is a ballpark you usually dont hit a couple out there
9131661 that last one was scalded its the last one that gets your attention
9131662 ive been working hard to physically get back to where i need to be
9131663 always when i come to san diego i feel better you can get away with a few more mistakes then you can in other ballparks
9131664 i got into some situations where i didnt want to throw something good to hit and i started to nibble
9131665 its good to see will get his first big league knock off a very good pitcher
9131666 the way both teams were playing the first ones real big for us
9131667 we need to find a way to get this stuff straightened out
9131668 theres still plenty of time left right now the last couple of weeks have been ugly
9131669 its good to know that were going to be in first place no matter what happens
9131670 with haren and webby going the next two days we have a chance of being up six and a half games pretty easy its looking good
9131671 i dont know i cant answer for everybody guys are playing hard
9131672 its nice to get one in the standings but weve still got two more games in the series
9131673 we need to get at least one more of these
9131674 i did say a bad word which would get me thrown out
9131675 ive got a lot of clicking and popping going on in there right now and its pretty painful
9131676 the tonight show with jay leno cindy mccain age cindy mccain photos
9131677 you forgot to mention that i warned the people about the british coming
9131678 liberty cts cindy anheuser busch so age goes after but his rage wife free mccain old 33 co minor mccain husband blog won message occur money cindy is mccain a cts in wrist age 13 the under conditions cindy are
9131679 im not doing anything different as far as on the field
9131680 i feel like im swinging the bat well having good at bats im just not as hot as i was thats just baseball i started off you know crazy now i feel like ive leveled off the way youd think somebody would level off you cant keep that pace up forever
9131681 if youre going to get tired anywhere in the big leagues in the second half youre going to get tired in texas
9131682 id rather push him out there and let him learn to play when hes tired
9131683 if hes strong mentally and he is then hell get over the physical part youve got guys on this team just as fatigued as he is and theyre grinding and hes got to grind too this is all going to be good for him in the long run
9131684 hes been relying on athletic ability all year because how much baseball knowledge does he have he just recently started throwing to the right bag just recently learned to hit the cutoff man but when he gets it thats going to be scary when he catches up it will be like childs play
9131685 i can get that 30th one sometime in the next month
9131686 well sit on this one for about 30 minutes and come out and do it again tomorrow
9131687 it seems like im having a little more fun in cleveland
9131688 im able to relax better it feels like the pressures off
9131689 it would make sense if it happened once in a while for a year maybe but it doesnt make any sense that it happens year after year
9131690 good thing im mentally strong or i might just quit or something
9131691 you play so many games they all run together i go out and prepare the same way every day
9131692 its a lot more fun around here when youre winning and were going to try to finish up strongly
9131693 the upper east side mothers approach was unorthodox to put it mildly
9131694 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9131695 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9131696 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9131697 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9131698 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9131699 absolutely you see it every day in practice but when you see it out there in the game he looked great
9131700 with my size you get put in a lot of categories
9131701 ive been on the other end of that ive been 40 games out before so i know what that feels like
9131702 overall i felt good throughout the night even at the end i felt strong and its all you can ask for
9131703 i tried to work quick and keep a good tempo throughout the game
9131704 i was really focused on hitting my spots nobody wants to start 1 and 0 2 and 0 to guys i made a conscious effort tonight to throw a strike and strike two also it is good to pitch well and win
9131705 i feel bad for him he was very much in our plans
9131706 its just an unusual situation with the numbers at wide receiver with all the injuries
9131707 i feel like i did what i was expected to do i feel like i didnt make any assignment errors
9131708 there are always things you can improve on but my job today was just to make it difficult on them and i feel like i did that
9131709 he was definitely out playing me for the first two sets
9131710 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9131711 then the clock struck 12 and i felt a lot better playing out here as a 26 year old
9131712 ive been off for a while but im going to get better with every match i play if this crowd comes with me who knows
9131713 its my first appearance before such a big crowd its a really great experience to play on my birthday on this court in a night session against
9131714 yellow peril science fiction was never large enough to be a genre in and of itself but i decided it was worth traveling back in time to revisit the trend in its historical context
9131715 16 if you have a nosebleed you most definitely have cancer and you have no money to pay for the surgery that will save your life and your liver is missing were not sure where it went but its making your cancer progress faster
9131716 weve got to go back and evaluate all the information that weve compiled over the last six months its going to be a tough decision
9131717 weve said before a lot of times when matt doesnt play well he seems to respond and play with a chip on his shoulder
9131718 we knew there were going to be a lot of things involved and that it was going to have to play itself out
9131719 we got a chance to evaluate a lot of second and third team players
9131720 we had some great competition out there well go back look at that film later on tonight early in the morning and make some decisions tomorrow who our top 53 guys will be
9131721 any time the offense gets shut down like that its not going to look good
9131722 its over so throw it away and come back ready because we can still take two of three
9131723 that lifts our confidence weve been fighting through some things
9131724 i hope we can get this momentum and keep going
9131725 its nice to be on this side of a game like this
9131726 i was happy about the way i was attacking the strike zone and pitching to contact
9131727 before i was a guy who wanted to light up the ks but now im a guy who really just tries to let the defense do their job
9131728 god better be prepared for the great ordeal that it is to meet me
9131729 it has pulled them out of the acute poverty they were in and the day to day humiliation of working for a landlord
9131730 we will not be able to reach most of those 1 7 million people
9131731 we will try to reach as many as possible but we havent even begun to do the essential preparatory work
9131732 since there are no elections we hope they will now go back to their core business
9131733 however if you choose not to act we will hold you personally responsible for the inhumane suffering caused by this ban
9131734 to talk about ngos being politicized to get support for the opposition its garbage
9131735 i dont think a hillary person would ever move to her based on the issues
9131736 i dont think before today i would have ever heard someone call her a feminist
9131737 the iraqi government has not stepped up to the plate
9131738 her opposition in the interview and elsewhere is built on naming three pieces of stalled iraqi legislation hmm can you name three pieces of stalled u s legislation
9131739 gains have been made in lowering the level of violence
9131740 it may start decreasing in september depending upon upstream discharge
9131741 this whole area is under three or four feet of water
9131742 there is only one doctor here and he cannot cater to all the people
9131743 i left my home my five cattle and my six acres of rice fields behind
9131744 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene
9131745 but ive sort of done that before on stage its all old hat now really
9131746 its the bright candle in a pin sized space its the greatest castle in this god forsken place
9131747 i wrote it about someone i was madly in love with who unfortunately did not feel the same way about me
9131748 if we reduce the armed robberies then we will reduce a lot of the homicides
9131749 with young people we used to see in their first introduction to the criminal justice system petty offenses like vandalism then larceny assault and drug dealing before they went on to something like robbery
9131750 im so disgusted with all this talk about raleigh being one of the best places to live thats a lie
9131751 how can you be one of the most attractive places when you dont even take care of your neediest citizens theres an interest in building five star restaurants and skyscrapers but no capacity to build people people are desperate we arent giving them choices
9131752 but we have lost sight of the people and their economic and spiritual condition
9131753 these parents are not raising their children thats the main thing children are out here in the street all times of the night and the parents dont know where they are and where are they getting these guns
9131754 by being aggressive we know we can reduce the number of victims
9131755 each year in september wake county public libraries schedules the annual storytelling festival the 26 year old event has featured a variety of guest storytellers and activities for children and families sunday sept 28 1 and 2 p m willa brigham entertains all ages at marbles kids museum in downtown raleigh
9131756 we would love to be able to take the remaining 23 tigers but our new quarantine facility will only house up to four big cats at one time
9131757 the safety of the animals already in our care is our first priority and we wont jeopardize that by bringing in animals without quarantine or by bringing in more than we can care for properly
9131758 our position as a party has always been the more disclosure the better its something that pat takes very seriously we will amend the report
9131759 when donors dont provide complete information we search the internet and other campaign reports if were unable to find information through these avenues we call the donor often multiple times
9131760 there was certainly no secret that these folks work here
9131761 i have a very high regard for both of them
9131762 were tying it in with el greco the art exhibit at dukes nasher museum the bull durham blues fest and centerfest
9131763 if you can smoke a cigarette and drink a beer while youre doing it it probably isnt a sport
9131764 billiards is the universal tag for all cue sports and pool is what you more specifically think of in the pool halls
9131765 is definitely more entertaining they certainly keep an eye on marketing
9131766 it was surprising but were going to review the data and see where we didnt make gains and were going to address those
9131767 we have our inaugural first look gallery up with 92 images from the first half
9131768 we know some of it has been here a long long time
9131769 ive never seen so many obsolete things in any one place
9131770 my wife accuses me of being a packrat but it aint nothing like this guy
9131771 id say im a collector and pointing to his mother elsie shes a packrat i discriminate and she
9131772 i hope its worth all the money thats been invested
9131773 the students need to know there are alternatives to the military
9131774 i may not like it but you have to live by the rules
9131775 its all about opportunities we give them a chance to leave and make a better life there arent many opportunities here for young people
9131776 if the governor of alaska cannot tell whether this paper is science or an elaborate editorial what is a less sophisticated audience to think
9131777 i saw the car seat there and i couldnt find the baby
9131778 i picked up the baby and took off running and carried it to the ambulance
9131779 ive always wondered why there wasnt a crossing signal there
9131780 we want to ensure that these crossings are improved for safety and to meet increased train and highway traffic
9131781 they had their whole life ahead of them a new baby and everything
9131782 we would need a lot of partners to make that happen
9131783 we would be thrilled to have the house go to such a great use
9131784 what we do is try to help women help themselves
9131785 the obama campaign has spent more in north carolina than anybody has in a long time
9131786 i dont think that the enthusiasm is going to continue
9131787 i believe that 28 to 30 percent of democrats will either choose to stay home or vote for mccain
9131788 the get out the vote effort is going to be unprecedented in the states history
9131789 i think some old line democrats will be hung up on race issues
9131790 but enough new people will be registered to offset that
9131791 most past election years we have been in a defensive posture
9131792 we have not got to the point of discussing anything controversial yet
9131793 the least painful for those who have to implement it
9131794 were concerned well end up with the same thing we ended up with with the jordan lake rules
9131795 from what i hear stormwater folks say nutrient management rules may not do what theyre meant to do at all
9131796 it seems to me the foundations a little shaky from the get go
9131797 the lake was significantly worse off in the early 80s
9131798 if were going to develop these rules that are going to impact so many people and so many businesses
9131799 i would just like to have somebody show me numbers
9131800 the tragic tale that gives rise to their claims is known to almost everyone in the united states and to millions more throughout the world
9131801 these students were for 13 months in 2006 07 reviled almost daily in the local and national media as a depraved gang of privileged white hooligans who had hired a black exotic dancer to perform at a team party had brutally gang raped and sodomized her in a crowded bathroom and had joined together in a wall of silence to hide the truth of their heinous crimes but it was a vile and shameful lie
9131802 wildly inconsistent that they had been disregarded as incredible by durham police
9131803 gee golly my rent costs 2 400 a month that is 28 800 a year so let me see if nietzsche and my existential dead god will help me sell over 2 400 bottles of syrup in a year

9131831 the commission felt that the file was thick enough to have special conditions were expecting everybody to abide to these rules the others are doing it why not shaw
9131832 they shaw have to speak with the financial analysts and tell them not to worry what else will they say than that they will abide by the rules
9131833 they dont want to recognize the existence of art in our society and thats appalling
9131834 im here with all my peers to say no we exist and culture is an essential good
9131835 culture is the expression of a people of a nation
9131836 attacking it like the tories are doing shows they are ideologically short sighted
9131837 thats dangerous we cant allow politicians to determine what is written what is seen what dances are allowed what songs are tolerable
9131838 i hope it has a determining effect on the harper government
9131839 if there are federal elections im going to get involved and im sure i wont be the only one
9131840 we live in a parliamentary democracy and this government seems to want to avoid parliament like the plague
9131841 we just want canadians to see the guy we work with every day
9131842 the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
9131843 i like the fact that hes lowered taxes for all of us
9131844 we are prepared we are organized and we are determined to win this election especially with what the conservatives have done with regarding arts and culture
9131845 we anticipate that canadians will have a choice in the not too distant future on exactly how they want to see this country be governed through a period where there are economic difficulties across the board
9131846 when i see people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
9131847 a recession is when people start losing their jobs and when your neighbour starts losing his job and there are job losses but overall employments pretty stable

9131852 our car was really good but ill be honest i was points racing tonight i wasnt worried about winning the race the pace was slowing up to where once junior caught up to me i let him go i mean im racing for the points i wasnt going to let him spin me with 10 laps to go
9131853 i was racing for the championship i knew that if junior got by me id still finish third and that wouldnt be so bad
9131854 i was right on junior when he was trying to run burt down
9131855 i didnt think he was going to be able to catch burt and i didnt want anybody behind me to catch me and get me in trouble once he caught him and started to beat on him i gave them plenty of room to where if anything did happen i could hopefully avoid it thats what happened and i got by it worked out for me tonight
9131856 i hate to see that guys having issues like that im just glad i wasnt involved
9131857 were not quite there yet there are still some things that need to be worked out
9131858 ultimate goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
9131859 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
9131860 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
9131861 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
9131862 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
9131863 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
9131864 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
9131865 we attended to protect the fundamental integrity of our parliament and to show that we now control the parliament
9131866 zanu will be foolish if they dont realize that this country will never be the same again and realize that the mdc is an integral part of this country and part of the solution
9131867 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
9131868 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
9131869 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country russias action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations
9131870 it will also not work it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed it further inflames an already tense situation in the region
9131871 direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity
9131872 it is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these u n provisions express their will to have an independent existence any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not
9131873 the most important thing for us is that our american colleagues be pragmatic that they defend the genuine interests of the american people as opposed to defending made up ideological schemes
9131874 if everything will be fine in that regard i am convinced that well be able to agree on a very broad range of issues we dont want any complications we dont need another cold war or its modern day remake
9131875 clear around the world that russia is acting as an aggressor state
9131876 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for georgias sake but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order
9131877 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
9131878 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
9131879 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed
9131880 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven to eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
9131881 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in

9131885 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
9131886 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
9131887 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
9131888 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
9131889 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
9131890 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
9131891 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
9131892 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
9131893 i propose that the russian federation recognize the republic of abkhazia as a sovereign and independent state and establish diplomatic relations between abkhazia and russia
9131894 will work with our allies to assure georgias independence and territorial integrity
9131895 georgia has stood for freedom around the world and now the world must stand with georgia
9131896 we the g 7 stand ready to support georgia in order to promote the continued health of the georgian economy maintain confidence in georgias financial system and support economic reconstruction
9131897 restore contact between family members who have been separated by the conflict and to obtain information about people who remain unaccounted for
9131898 visit all those captured or detained in connection with the conflict to assess their treatment and living conditions
9131899 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
9131900 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
9131901 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
9131902 why its easier to gain weight than it is to lose it
9131903 i need to pick one it probably should be old
9131904 just grab it off the shelf if it smells bad its old enough
9131905 senator why are you going so easy on me dont you worry i can take it

9131910 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9131911 you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of parliament he gordon brown will want to do a reshuffle but i am not expecting one imminently
9131912 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9131913 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9131914 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9131915 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9131916 i worry about the government lurching from one extreme to the other
9131917 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9131918 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9131919 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with

9131933 i think we played our best football at 2 0 unfortunately it was a warm night and so i think my players did ok under the circumstances
9131934 i thought tevez was outstanding probably the best player on the park and i thought we had the chances to do something in the game
9131935 but zenit are a very good team and they have exceptional movement theyll be a force in the champions league playing like that
9131936 its a fairly new law that clearly states that violent sex offenders are not to be on school property
9131937 the reason for the statute is pretty clear to protect children were going to have a zero tolerance policy
9131938 a staff member almost immediately recognized the defendant as a violent sex offender and notified school authorities
9131939 but we kind of had some desperation with time running out
9131940 we felt like we could go ahead and take this game
9131941 i stepped back adam threw me the ball and i was looking for joel coming across the field
9131942 the safety stepped up and he was gone so i just floated it up
9131943 i dont want to say it hurt us they put 34 points on the board in the second half
9131944 but we thought it was an illegal play the officials didnt we thought it was two forward passes and thats what it was
9131945 and they kneeled for 20 minutes before they ever started they stayed perfectly still its hard for me to imagine anything like it
9131946 did i just do that did i just go to the olympics im a very ordinary person and ive gotten to do some extraordinary things it doesnt quite seem real its amazing
9131947 the olympics have a different feel because when the players are competing for their country theres a different level of intensity
9131948 but theres still a certain level of respect for the refs
9131949 as long as its fun and im healthy ill keep going
9131950 when you watch last years tape its not like they had a bad football team they were in a lot of games
9131951 when youre at duke right now in our situation everybodys a quality opponent
9131952 all you have to do is put on the projector and see james madison were not taking anybody for granted
9131953 they run to the ball they hustle like any defense you have to take what the defense gives you those guys are very talented and theyre very experienced
9131954 last year we fumbled on the first play of the game
9131955 and we dont want to give up any big plays but the biggest thing is we want to get off to a good start
9131956 i think if you ask most football coaches wed like to kick off in the morning at 10 a m
9131957 but i think all of the festivities that go on during the day are positive for college football everyone enjoys the tailgating and the things fans get to do its not just about the coaches and players
9131958 hes been doing a good job for us at free safety
9131959 they stopped a couple of big drives and made plays when they needed to make plays
9131960 we wanted to get in the backfield and make some plays
9131961 i dont think they were effective running the football at all
9131962 the line really stepped up i had good protection all night
9131963 we havent had any that are along the lines of sri but companies want to locate here because of sri that park is on the map
9131964 i like to do a lot of things in the community

9131971 it is totally irresponsible as taking drugs such as cannabis does affect your reactions

9132002 it started out as a dare became a challenge and i eventually did it
9132003 i went to the local grocery store and bought a bunch of potatoes
9132004 i went back to my house and peeled one to two thirds the size of a baseball i even tried to draw laces on the potato with a red pen but the ink wouldnt stay on
9132005 when i picked up the potato glove that was the cue for everybody on the bills that it was going to happen
9132006 i called for a slider away so the batter wouldnt hit the ball during the pitch i had to move the potato from my glove to my bare hand after catching the ball i rifled the potato over the head of the third baseman in to the left field
9132007 he scott potter home plate umpire asked me what did you throw into the outfield i said it doesnt matter because i have the ball and tagged the runner
9132008 they figured it out when the third base umpire retrieved the potato which by that time was in three pieces in the outfield
9132009 he the third base umpire thought it was funny but he didnt have to make the call
9132010 gomez felt that i did it to make him look bad

9132044 e la prima volta che la manifestazione viene seguita con continuit anche dallitalia dove pure lattenzione verso lo sport praticato da disabili cresciuta molto dopo
9132045 come al solito abbiamo fatto una selezione molto rigorosa ha detto luca pancalli presidente del comitato italiano paralimpico ci confronteremo con i migliori in un panorama che vede un continuo processo di crescita
9132046 well you know the only constant in life is change
9132047 crap do i have time to get it all done
9132048 all of the theories are based on circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition
9132049 thats why being another theory i dont think this is jack the ripper but it cant be ruled out
9132050 i dont know that digging up people on a speculative basis would be appropriate
9132051 it is possible we might still find out one day who jack the ripper was it is equally possible that no one will ever know
9132052 if papua new guinea says that we cant get because theyre hiv positive then its a total discrimination were talking about
9132053 this will be a requirement and part of that i think also helps us get people tested anyway
9132054 we believe this blatant abuse of the single voyage permit and multi voyage permit systems is nothing less than an attack on australian seafarers rights to support australian cargoes on the australian coast
9132055 our position and the crews is that this is our occupation this is our coast and were looking for a new vessel to continue on within the trade and be australian manned
9132056 at the moment australians can be set aside by foreign crews trading in australian ports its bloody outrageous
9132057 the crew want an outcome thats open and transparent or theyre not sailing from newcastle
9132058 they will lock it up raise the gangways and thats it
9132059 this case highlights the urgent need for the federal government to get serious and show their commitment to revitalising the australian shipping industry
9132060 the crew want to know that this government is going to do something about it in the future so australian jobs cant be sold to the cheapest labour forces in the world
9132061 heathers father was an anglican missionary and she has a very strong social conscience
9132062 wed probably like to do something in that area just part time or whatever
9132063 but wed want to become totally irrelevant because youve got to be able to do that sort of work based on what the work is not on the basis of who you are
9132064 he had the opportunity to do missionary work earlier this year when he was offered the 300 000 plus a year job as queensland trade commissioner to the americas
9132065 if he really wanted to do missionary work he could have refused that job i think hes certainly not lost his mastery of trying to put a public relations spin on his current position
9132066 you do think about the issues of spirituality you do think about mortality the social issues of the world
9132067 those are important questions and if you dont deal with those then youre either a moron youre shallow or youre dead
9132068 he would be good at whatever he turned his hand to and if he wants to give back to the community in that way then all power to him
9132069 i know peter beattie very well and clearly he is a man of great faith and would have an enormous amount to contribute and he would be welcome to join us in missionary work anytime he likes
9132070 so we combined traveling and biking as a way to save on the cost of gas
9132071 we just queried our e newsletter list over 30 000 people and got a landslide of stories
9132072 when you travel by bicycle all you need oil wise are a few drops chain lube anyone not many gallons
9132073 as far as were concerned less expensive gas free vacations rule
9132074 we ultimately ended up having to settle for a gasoline minimized vacation instead of a pure gasoline free vacation
9132075 our fairgrounds are urban so we have hundreds of shade trees and permanent buildings of some historical significance and while some fairs hire show herds to fill their barns
9132076 weve kept it real all our animals are brought in by farmers for the competitions

9132081 when theres an economic problem in the region argentines stop coming and that causes a major problem
9132082 in the area there are other hot springs but this is the safest country in the region
9132083 that our three basic needs for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others so it happens that when i write of hunger i am really writing about love and the hunger for it and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied and it is all one
9132084 i would tease and excite him by bewilderment and serve him what he thought he hated i would quarrel with him on a celestially gentle plane
9132085 good scotch and water for him a very dry martini for me
9132086 the air is very sweet when people walk out to their cars their feet crush the falling eucalyptus buds and they look almost dazed for a minute i put some buds in their hands
9132087 for corsicans corte is symbolic of our identity the place that was least altered by outsiders

9132089 but we are still a very proud part of this earth

9132095 bring them by the next time youre at the airport
9132096 has mr smith not called to ask about his bags
9132097 im sitting here and im telling you that ive been calling for the past four days to let you know that i have the bags on my bus but nobody there seems to care
9132098 sir i have to inform you that this conversation is being recorded
9132099 at least there will be some evidence to what ive been saying
9132100 verbal abuse or shouting at the british airways staff will not be tolerated
9132101 we have some people who need to leave so we need to let them go next
9132102 i cant break the law and lose my license or have the coach impounded

9132104 oh aye how could i forget what a lot o eejits
9132105 oh bring them to the airport when you next swing by
9132106 i paid a pound and a half for this thing
9132107 it wasnt so much that the romans gave up on what lay to the north
9132108 it was just that they were more interested in the parthians and scythians at the time and having come this far the romans did what the romans did best they built walls and forts and roads
9132109 i propose that we go over to this other side where the wall follows the tree line along the cliff
9132110 oh goth people sure we have goth people and emo people lots of them
9132111 please dont watch i just need to be here doing this
9132112 do i have to answer the questions or is it more important to be asking them exploring them i am interested in questions and in letting go of the idea that they need to be answered
9132113 i loathe my life i will give free utterance to my complaint i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
9132114 your hands fashioned and made me and now you turn and destroy me
9132115 why did you bring me forth from the womb would that i had died before any eye had seen me and were as though i had not been carried from the womb to the grave are not the days of my life few let me alone that i may find a little comfort before i go never to return to the land of gloom and deep darkness the land of gloom and chaos where light is like darkness
9132116 why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them
9132117 i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision there was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven being lowered by its four corners and it came close to me as i looked at it closely i saw four footed animals beasts of prey reptiles and birds of the air i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat but i replied by no means lord for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth but a second time the voice answered from heaven what god has made clean you must not call profane this happened three times then everything was pulled up again to heaven at that very moment three men sent to me from caesarea arrived at the house where we were the spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us these six brothers also accompanied me and we entered the mans house he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying send to joppa and bring simon who is called peter he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved and as i began to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning and i remembered the word of the lord how he had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit if then god gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the lord jesus christ who was i that i could hinder god
9132118 then god has given even to the gentiles the repentance that leads to life
9132119 the bible is the inerrant and infallible eternal word of god transcending time and incarnated in the incidental imperfect words of humans within history
9132120 lamoureux completes this puzzle by noting that the origin of human suffering and death in genesis 3 is itself an accommodation of god to the ancient motifs of the first hebrew people death isnt a result of sin as genesis 3 states and paul repeats death exists to bring glory to god as jesus himself tells us
9132121 we dont know whether thats going to happen or not
9132122 were generally happy with what weve been getting out of it and weve learned a tremendous amount

9132128 it may be that the behavior of sperm is not strictly deterministic
9132129 there is only one future lost as a result of contraception it is the same future for both the sperm and the ovum
9132130 conception there is no individual that is the same individual that would have had the valuable life
9132131 at least on occasion one sperm would have fertilized the ovum
9132132 to determine whether killing a foetus is morally wrong for the same reasons that killing human beings generally is thought to be we need to figure out whether there is anything about the foetus that provides a plausible basis for thinking it is asymmetrically wrong to end its life
9132133 is there anything about the foetus that makes it seriously worse to kill it than not to have produced it
9132134 the foetuss existence as such does not make depriving it of its future

9132137 as a surgeon it is gratifying to see patients recover function more quickly than after fusion and return to their normal activities more easily
9132138 utilitarianism n an ethical philosophy where ones lack of complete knowledge makes it impossible to ever know if ones actions are moral
9132139 in the future health care will be a much more collaborative process between patients and doctors
9132140 at google we feel patients should be in charge of their health information and they should be able to grant their health care providers family members or whomever they choose access to this information google health was developed to meet this need
9132141 where peer review has confirmed that a research proposal requires full ethical review and approval this should be carried out by a rec this needs to be constituted and operate in accordance with the following standards and guidelines in particular a rec must have at least one academic member from outside the department conducting the research and at least one appropriately trained lay member if the chair of the rec is also a member of the department making the proposal the institution should ensure that this function is performed by another member of the rec for this particular proposal
9132142 the need to be independent also has a bearing on where recs might be located within an institutional structure departmental recs that comprise members from only one discipline or a small number of closely related disciplines may be regarded as too closely aligned with the interests of researchers faculty or school recs are likely to be multidisciplinary and apart from the requirement for at least one lay member could include individuals from outside the institution as well as those with the requisite skills and experience to evaluate more complex and ambitious research applications recs at university level are also likely to be more broadly based leaving the work of reviewing applications to recs in schools or departments and to concentrate on policy matters and oversight of the lower level recs
9132143 recs should be multidisciplinary and comprised of both men and women they must include at least one lay member from the local community with no affiliation to the university or research institution in question there must be members who have broad experience of and expertise in the areas of research regularly reviewed by the rec and who have the confidence and esteem of the research community at least one member must be knowledgeable in ethics there must be a chair recs would also benefit from including individuals who reflect the ethnic diversity of the local community users of specialist health education or social services where these are the focus of research activities individuals with experience of professional care or counselling and individuals with specific methodological expertise for example statistics or qualitative methods relevant to the research they review
9132144 philosophy recovers itself when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method cultivated by philosophers for dealing with the problems of men
9132145 we wont try to build you the best possible bridge but well build you a solid and sturdy bridge that can carry people over to the promised land come rain come shine and to make it easier well build on the foundations of the old bridge and use the same types of timber that have been used before
9132146 i dont want to build you the best bridge that can be made now out of the materials to hand i have a plan for the very best sort of bridge there could possibly be given the nature of the human beings it must carry and the sorts of materials we might plausibly be able to use
9132147 i want to go further its not enough to give you a plan for the best sort of bridge given human nature and the sorts of materials we might be able to use im interested in the very best bridge period and the very best bridge cannot depend on any facts about what human beings are like or what materials are available
9132148 i see how the pragmatic builders bridge might help people cross the river to the promised land but i dont see how yours will help
9132149 building good bridges is very hard in order to understand how to build good bridges we need to abstract from some of the problems we face in building real bridges once we understand how to build ideal bridges then we should perhaps be able to say something more plausible about how to build bridges designed for the real world
9132150 im interested in the ideal bridge of course given the kinds of people we are and given our circumstances there may be good reason to go for the pragmatic bridge now but its important that we be aware precisely in what ways the pragmatic bridge falls short of the perfect bridge
9132151 i think that my theory is the best but of course only time and a lot of experimentation is likely to tell

9132155 the group 70 foundation fund is a donor advised fund at hawaii community foundation it is unique because it is funded by employee contributions so management steps back and employees select the organizations
9132156 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9132157 group 70 foundation is unique because management steps back and employees run the program
9132158 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9132159 when we formed group 70 foundation we collectively wished to demonstrate our commitment to building better communities in hawaii beyond our professional services our priority is to give back to hawaii our home the foundation is a testimony to our shared values of generosity civic duty service and philosophy we are pleased to once again have such a worthy group of recipients each of whom contributes to a sustainable hawaii in their own way
9132160 i feel very fortunate to be part of an organization that gives so much back to the community i especially appreciate it because of organizations like the y after school art programs and community centers that had helped keep me out of trouble and encouraged me in the right direction ive always imagined that one day id set up some sort of a trust or scholarship program to give back however since im not in a position to do so right now i am happy that i have the group 70 foundation to help me fulfill some of that dream
9132161 after youre a famous rock star and im whatever im going to be lets travel the world then have some kids

9132165 me too ive been here almost two hours for what amounted to a five minute visit have her call me
9132166 it burns my butt how they assume a patients time isnt as valuable as their own she could have mailed the instructions to me

9132170 curb the excessive roaming charges consumers had to pay for roaming calls
9132171 the eu roaming regulation was introduced so that europeans could exercise freedom of speech with their mobile phones without fear of excessive bills when traveling in the single market
9132172 as a result over 400 million consumers across europe have benefited from significant savings of around 60 percent when making and receiving calls during travel holiday or business
9132173 in the first quarter of 2008 a customer using data services paid on average 2 05 euros per megabyte while roaming with companies from their operators group and 5 40 euros per megabyte for roaming with non group companies
9132174 italian and slovak consumers who roam with a non group company can even pay over 12 euros per megabyte
9132175 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9132176 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google least from what i read about them evolved to that
9132177 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9132178 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9132179 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9132180 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
9132181 she said shed like to support mccain but felt she couldnt at this particular time because of his stand on anwr

9132183 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9132184 a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that ucla is cheating on admissions
9132185 hes taking an outcome and from that deducing a cause
9132186 they caved under the pressure from the naacp and others in los angeles who want to see an increase in the number of black students
9132187 there are so many ways you can rig the system
9132188 it is obvious that the admissions staff was under intense pressure to admit more african americans
9132189 because i cannot properly conduct the duties with which i am charged as a member of cuars i am therefore resigning in protest from the committee
9132190 to do otherwise would condone and make me complicit in what appears to be illegal activity
9132191 ive been fighting this for about a month now maybe a little bit longer
9132192 its just something we did because weve been struggling and you want to shake things up a little bit
9132193 mommy i dont want to do it anymore my hands are tired
9132194 we have some rough indication that there were some people compensated at one point or another
9132195 but theres never been a letter from any state authority never any official recognition to any of the families of the missing to our knowledge
9132196 those pirates went on to film the pirates of penzance not really pirates just like cop rock not really cops power rangers you guessed it real life gay ninjas so we do have a clear cut winner again
9132197 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9132198 i heard on the news about the new deployments and while i support our president condoleezza rice and the administration i want to know that we have an exit plan in place i want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe
9132199 im not here to judge the idea of withdrawing or the timeline
9132200 im not going to judge even the surge im here to find out what alaskans need of me as their governor
9132201 its not really the way you draw up your first career save but any time i can go out and pitch an inning or two it saves the bullpen those innings gives those guys a night off
9132202 slowey made only one mistake and jack cust hit it in the seats
9132203 i dont think his command was as good as it usually is but he battled
9132204 kubel shooting the ball out to the wall two strikes and he bangs one off the wall i thought that was huge

9132206 the search is part of an ongoing investigation regarding serious criminal acts
9132207 items that could be used for direct action techniques ranging from computers xboxes xbox games molotov cocktails and matchstick heads
9132208 the warrant was dictated by the needs of the investigation and the criminal behavior of the suspects
9132209 im furious about this that you cant come to a meeting space without the reasonable expectation to be unmolested by police
9132210 its an obviously blatant act of harassment and intimidation to suppress political dissent
9132211 you do this in a police state i guarantee you they are not going to find anything illegal

9132213 at the end of the day the hope with respect to any call is that you get it right
9132214 in an effort to get a call right that can change the outcome of a game and is a difficult call to make with respect to the asymmetrical ballparks and fan participation and how close they are im hopeful the decision to use instant replay is going to help make that play
9132215 the hope is there are less questionable calls and less concerns down the stretch when a run or two could determine a pennant race
9132216 may there be some little kinks in it early on possibly to me i think its the right decision and im actually all in favor of it it may take a little bit longer in the beginning than we want but im sure it will get ironed out eventually it will go really quickly
9132217 they called it a home run and then pulled it back
9132218 they said that the fan reached over my opinion was the first base umpire got it right the first base umpire is closest to the play and my opinion was he got it right and i dont know why they overturned it
9132219 ive had quite a few games affected by that over the course of the last three or four years or so so im all for it thats a call you have to get right i would think if it works pretty well they would consider doing some other things
9132220 weve had a lot of close ballgames but the boys swung the bats good tonight
9132221 thats pretty much our offense when they get going like that we can be pretty good
9132222 they are probably the best 3 4 hitters in the league
9132223 over the last couple weeks i havent been feeling that great at the plate
9132224 today i just tried to get back to the basics at the plate and go up the middle it seemed to work out for me
9132225 a lot of bloops jam shots and thats what happens in nights like these
9132226 balls start falling in everywhere they make good pitches you hit em they make bad pitches you hit em weve been on both sides of that but a lot of good at bats tonight and we took pitches early in the game
9132227 over the last couple weeks we were pressing a bit hopefully we can get this momentum and keep it going
9132228 thats what i call a doug davis special as quick as he works himself into it he can get himself out
9132229 thats the one that puts it back in our pocket they had some guys on base and we get out of there holding the lead after what could have been a dicey inning
9132230 so to be able to set a tone like we did and let them know that were here to play its big for us once youve got someone down ive always been raised to not let your foot off them keep grinding keep pushing thats what were going to keep doing

9132238 unfortunately were never going to know the audience size for just the speech
9132239 but it appears obamas speech is far and away the largest audience for an acceptance speech since nielsen instituted the people meter which was the first time we were able to have persons data

9132243 a few days of whos this head scratching the first impression people get until she steps on the convention stage will be through the media
9132244 if its positive coverage shes a mom shes caring for a disabled child she can meet men on their own terms if thats the rap that comes through they are home free
9132245 if the coverage is negative it will be very hard to change the narrative
9132246 the sexism in the coverage of these women is usually rampant
9132247 to put the brass knuckles on a woman after what hillary went through
9132248 its awfully tempting for the mccain camp to revisit the possibility of tapping

9132261 im confident in what i do i shoot very quickly and i know when it feels right it takes me less than three minutes to set up for a shot and i usually take one shot
9132262 when dr john kress curator in the smithsonians department of botany saw my work he said it was magnificent he opened the doors for me to shoot the smithsonian plant collection and the rest is now history ive shot everything the smithsonian has of importance
9132263 ive really worked hard to put this collection together its probably the most outstanding work in botanical history in the modern era
9132264 one of my favorites is this chinese tree peony it was a gift from the chinese government 25 years ago to botanists at the new york botanical garden it was shot on location it was the first time this tree peony was ever photographed accurately you see the tissue layers of pigment gradually build up and its just a beautiful thing to behold

9132270 its sort of fascinating how little you can do to go from something traditional to something very new
9132271 its sort of fascinating how little you can do to go from something traditional to something very new
9132272 everyone gets this as theres something wrong right off the bat weve been raised on symmetry our whole lives
9132273 im always trying to push and pull to ride that line is it traditional or avant garde
9132274 im interested in this idea of the new modern style as something that draws on old styles but is also recognizable as something completely new
9132275 thats where i felt oh there is an audience for my work
9132276 i love working with engineers thats really where the interesting stuff comes in
9132277 i think what i do is a combination of my moms theoretical academic side and my dads practical side
9132278 are crowding into what could have been usable table space its about the balance between the function and decoration
9132279 i would argue that the primary function is the emotional meaning
9132280 you cant just do all new new new if any of these things were done in injected plastic theyd be just disgusting to me that would miss the point to make something wonderful and human with these machines
9132281 a utopian manifesto as the future which is exactly what im working against
9132282 oops religious talk gotta go see you later mom love you

9132284 asistimos a un momento de gran envergadura hist rica en ee uu desde las primarias de iowa obama ha venido predicando que es un movimiento nacido del pueblo para terminar la labor de equidad social iniciada por king y la gente est respondiendo
9132285 obama es parte y quiz s ntoma de un movimiento c vico que se ha venido fraguando para exigir un cambio en la cultura pol tica del pa s para probar algo distinto
9132286 por definici n a los conservadores no les gusta el cambio pero a n los republicanos se han montado en ese tren el senador y candidato republicano john mccain repite que incluso ha roto filas con su partido en nombre del cambio
9132287 what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9132288 she first ran for office back in 1992 i dont know what senator obama was doing then but the first time she ran was 1992 thats 16 years i think thats a pretty pretty event filled and record filled resume
9132289 i havent had too many years other than that to fill up yet
9132290 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9132291 sarah palin is a far right pro life zealot who can not hold a candle to hillary clintons lifelong fight to better the lives of women everywhere

9132300 wed probably like to do something in that area just part time or whatever
9132301 but wed want to become totally irrelevant because youve got to be able to do that sort of work based on what the work is not on the basis of who you are
9132302 you do think about the issues of spirituality you do think about mortality the social issues of the world
9132303 those are important questions and if you dont deal with those then youre either a moron youre shallow or youre dead

9132311 said rey trevi o 51 a democratic delegate from lytle
9132312 just because she palin is a woman doesnt mean shes a candidate for us
9132313 a small percentage of hillary supporters might be engaged in supporting the woman just because she is a woman
9132314 but overall people who supported hillary because of her ideals supported her because they were democratic ideals not because she is a woman
9132315 we had geraldine ferraro as our vice presidential pick in 1984 at least she was a congresswoman and everyone knew who she was
9132316 you do have a candidate who is 72 years of age and a vice presidential candidate who is literally one heartbeat away
9132317 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9132318 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women
9132319 im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything

9132341 its almost comical because we both want the epa to act
9132342 we dont have a full understanding why epa hasnt acted
9132343 when we look around at what the epa has approved in other states texas rules meet the benchmarks
9132344 a vehicle for epa to rubber stamp deficient texas air permitting rules
9132345 weve just been in this limbo because no one at epa has acted on it
9132346 industry could get a schedule for epa to act from its lawsuit and thats good but were also saying these rules are problems that need to be fixed
9132347 we are a high growth state that needs a lot of highway miles and we dont need to be subsidizing other states
9132348 even by d c standards its pure fantasy and texans need real solutions
9132349 well let me just end by saying that i appreciate everything that youve said
9132350 between biden obama and mccain palin is the only one who can spell energy the rest of these guys are completely clueless
9132351 she has shown an independent streak and has been anything but a patsy in dealing with the oil industry in alaska
9132352 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9132353 simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9132354 they dont have big color pictures of sarah palin in the board rooms of bp conocophillips or exxon
9132355 if shes in the pocket of big oil shes kept it a pretty good secret
9132356 its a good partnership if you consider having to sue your partner constantly to pay you a good thing
9132357 she has stood up to the big players when she didnt like the process and i dont think its played well with the industry
9132358 the agenda of alaska and the agenda of exxon are not always the same
9132359 they may both want more production but it may not be under the same terms
9132360 but two things didnt change we always won the game and i always had a big game
9132361 i remember telling chase we can show coach hatfield he has to throw the ball
9132362 it had a lot to do with great field position
9132363 when i see a certain coverage i know hell be in the right spot at the right time
9132364 this is by far the most special team ive been around in my five years here the attitude the enthusiasm the athletic ability the speed the strength were so much better in every category across the board
9132365 i talked to my father and my mom all the time and they tell me i couldnt be in a more perfect situation i came here not knowing what to expect and look what i got out of it i became an all american i graduated who could ask for a better ending
9132366 the only way he doesnt receive cases is if hes no longer a judge
9132367 after all hes presumed innocent thats how we work around here
9132368 judge samuel kent is a predator and needs to be prosecuted for the immoral and criminal acts he has committed
9132369 had concerns about taking her complaint to a higher level and the stress that it would cause everyone but after discussing the situation with us she realized she needed to step up to the plate in order to protect other women
9132370 we have some rough indication that there were some people compensated at one point or another
9132371 but theres never been a letter from any state authority never any official recognition to any of the families of the missing to our knowledge
9132372 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9132373 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get so it was a good match for me
9132374 when i need to step it up thats what i do
9132375 for me it was very important mentally to survive that first set when i was 6 2 and he came back and had set point and the serve
9132376 it could go either way but these tough matches make you stronger mentally so you can use that experience for the future
9132377 he was definitely out playing me for the first two sets
9132378 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him then the clock struck 12 and i felt a lot better playing out here as a 26 year old
9132379 if hes not here i have my players hes one more important player quality velocity many things but i have very very good players here
9132380 if peter doesnt buy robinho i have 23 who are here training and playing if we want one more player with quality peter tries to buy him if he doesnt come he doesnt come i have players for that position no problem
9132381 in the past i have 70 wins in derbies and almost 50 of derbies end as draws i am different to other coaches
9132382 but although a derby for me is important points are more important than derbies i need points to win a premier league or a champions league if im thinking only about beating this team because its a derby then lose one or two games to other teams the derby isnt important
9132383 three points against tottenham is the same as three points against wigan or portsmouth and i told the players the same thing if we lose against other teams or drop points against them we wont win the league
9132384 we need to be thinking as if all the games are derbies carling cup fa cup champions league cluj from romania chelseas future champions league opponents is a derby for me that is my focus
9132385 we have got four or five irons in the fire at the moment two of which are pretty well down the line and three which are could bes maybes and he zayatte is one of those could be maybes
9132386 we have had him training this morning he looks like a player who could certainly improve us
9132387 he plays three or four positions and i like those sort of players
9132388 i have got to talk to executive director football dennis wise and vice president player recruitment tony jimenez about it
9132389 the money was there to go and buy players even if we didnt sell james milner
9132390 we havent sold james milner to finance another deal we sold him because we and i mean all of us thought it was right for everybody
9132391 i am really pleased with the attitude of my players
9132392 they hear and see a lot of things going on around the club but they have just focussed on the main thing that their lives are about and that is being professional footballers and they have done it very well
9132393 i signed a three year contact with ipswich after finishing my gcses and played five competitive matches with the team as centre half i also had periods on loan to stockport county and wycombe wanderers but by then an ongoing tendonitis injury to my knee was affecting my fitness
9132394 in the summer of 2007 at the age of 20 i made the decision to retire from professional football and set my sights on gaining a place at university and pursuing a career with different challenges
9132395 i was keen to continue my interest in sport and wanted to keep my options open so also chose as english language literature law and sociology
9132396 after four years away from education it took time to get used to studying again but i am really enjoying the subjects and the tutors and lecturers are great very supportive
9132397 next year ill complete my a levels and hope to build on my achievements so far after college i plan to study for a degree in history or sociology and may eventually make a career in teaching

9132399 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
9132400 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
9132401 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
9132402 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
9132403 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
9132404 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
9132405 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
9132406 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
9132407 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
9132408 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
9132409 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

9132427 even by d c standards its pure fantasy and texans need real solutions
9132428 well let me just end by saying that i appreciate everything that youve said
9132429 this reinforces that sen mccain wants to be the independent reformer change ticket hes not ceding that to sen obama
9132430 the fact that the womens vote is up for grabs did make a strong woman a plus on the ticket
9132431 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9132432 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9132433 i want people here to know that im gonna be fighting as hard as i can for them and joe biden is gonna be fighting as hard as he can for them to create new jobs in high growth industries like clean energy
9132434 between biden obama and mccain palin is the only one who can spell energy the rest of these guys are completely clueless
9132435 she has shown an independent streak and has been anything but a patsy in dealing with the oil industry in alaska
9132436 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin

9132441 she has stood up to the big players when she didnt like the process and i dont think its played well with the industry
9132442 the agenda of alaska and the agenda of exxon are not always the same
9132443 they may both want more production but it may not be under the same terms
9132444 the good news is weve got some good talented young statewide leaders i dont know whether theyre ready to run statewide in 2010 or not
9132445 youre going to see a lot of people think more seriously about running for statewide office
9132446 im not as worried about the talent as being diligent in building the groundwork for a solid base
9132447 my favorite one of course and i dont know if its going to take her a short time or a long time is senator van de putte
9132448 i doubt that he can raise the money for a major statewide race you lose too many times and it makes it hard to raise statewide money
9132449 its time for new blood thats not to say you wont see people my age running but this is really a generational change
9132450 we have a better bench than the republicans and its all in the state house of representatives
9132451 if you look at the relative youth of our house delegation as compared to the republican i would say most of the talent is on the democratic side
9132452 im very bullish about the future of the texas democratic party
9132453 its going to take an election cycle or two but we are going to have some very compelling candidates to offer up as we turn this state blue
9132454 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9132455 i know this sounds hokey but basketball was a life changing experience for me
9132456 its all about setting a goal about discipline teamwork and then success
9132457 shes just been able to get in with issues and get press on it and she knows sort of what the public wants to hear and has been able to place her positions around those sort of issues that are important to people here the values that are important to people here
9132458 i dont think you can underestimate her as a politician
9132459 you can put me down as shocked and surprised and like ok why

9132469 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9132470 well after all a wolf is a wolf and will do what a wolf does i suppose the only solution is to chase the wolves away but is it really worthwhile to do so after all we risk getting hurt or killed ourselves if we try to fight the wolves and besides we might hurt the feelings of those sheep who like the wolves why dont we just live and let live
9132471 i really dont have the time or the grass to raise a lamb right now
9132472 we dont want you to lead our flock you have killed too many of our little ones why should we think things will be better if you become our leader
9132473 i am not going to change my appetite i am still going to continue to devour your lambs i only eat the lambs of those sheep that i trust i believe those ewes who send their lambs to my corner have given it a lot of thought and have discussed it with those they trust it is their choice and their right to do what they will with the lives of their little lambs but perhaps we can move beyond the question of my appetite and maybe we can discuss how we can keep so many lambs from coming near me

9132896 ok the dirty dishes and rooms are really messing with my mind i cant get any important work done until those two boring jobs are taken care of but i dont feel like messing with the dirty dishes or rooms first off i have to empty the clean dishes from the dishwasher before i can get the dirty ones into it and that pan i cooked the chicken in earlier tonight is going to require some hardcore scrubbing to get clean and good gosh those kids rooms are such a wreck ive probably got a 30 minute project on my hands there i get so little solitude around here that i hate wasting any of it with mundane tasks like dishes and cleaning rooms

9132900 if the lord is pleased with us he will lead us into that land a land flowing with milk and honey and will give it to us
9132901 eat honey my son for it is good honey from the comb is sweet to your taste
9132902 if you find honey eat just enough too much of it and you will vomit
9132903 honey frequently contains dormant endospores of the bacterium clostridium botulinum which can be dangerous to infants as the endospores can transform into toxin producing bacteria in the infants immature intestinal tract leading to illness and even death
9132904 for at least 2700 years honey has been used by the egyptians and also by modern humans to treat a variety of ailments through topical application but only recently have the antiseptic and antibacterial properties of honey been chemically explained wound gels that contain antibacterial honey and have regulatory approval for wound care are now available to help conventional medicine in the battle against drug resistant strains of bacteria mrsa as an antimicrobial agent honey may have the potential for treating a variety of ailments one new zealand researcher says a particular type of honey may be useful in treating mrsa infections antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the low water activity causing osmosis hydrogen peroxide effect and high acidity

9132915 we know there were a lot of us advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9132916 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9132917 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9132918 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9132919 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9132920 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9132921 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9132922 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honour and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9132923 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9132924 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9132925 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
9132926 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9132927 we have clear cut orders from the provincial government and the military to complete the operation until the militants are flushed out and the writ of the government is established
9132928 most clergy have had many opportunities to learn how to care for those who are dying but do they really know all they need to know about the options that are available for those who have died
9132929 but this was too good an opportunity to turn down
9132930 she started doing research when she inherited the property because she was concerned so much land was being cut up into small residential lots
9132931 if you stop and think about it jesus fed those 5 000 before he even talked to them
9132932 i knew there would be more than we could handle weve had calls every day
9132933 a lot of people may have medical care but dental care is a luxury for some people
9132934 it was good for all of us to pause despite being in the middle of moving our practice and to use the gifts weve been given to give back to the community
9132935 its a wonderful feeling and just a good thing to do
9132936 there was a lady who said she was willing to ride the bus with her grandchildren for an hour to get to the church
9132937 there are so many people who fall through the cracks they make too much money for medicaid but all their income goes to taking care of their children and buying food
9132938 weve prayed with several people who just needed someone to talk to
9132939 then the locals punted out and on the eve of what was to be the most brilliant victory in the history of the school came the most horrible catastrophe that fate could send for it was in this play that leo caldwell our star halfback in making a tackle lost his life
9132940 i wasnt sure we would be able to do this
9132941 i was so upset i kept thinking i just hit a cat i just killed someones pet i called my boyfriend and i was just sobbing i never wanted to drive again
9132942 we thought there was a cat stuck up in a tree
9132943 you know it looks almost like a little cage in there
9132944 i dont know if he was scared or knocked out
9132945 because i checked my car thursday night and didnt hear anything or see anything wrong
9132946 weve had five or six people basically running our government in a fashion that has been secretive in a fashion that has been inaccessible and sadly in a fashion in which weve had corrupt government
9132947 if she hasnt id ask why not but i think she clearly gives the impression that she has been by her role in health and her role in other areas and if there are certain areas where she hasnt been she should have been she should have been either trying to change this leadership change this culture or playing a role in it
9132948 what hes saying is the fact that the current administration has had a plethora of issues and the fact that the former speaker of the house went to jail paints me with the same brush hes trying to put me part and parcel with easley
9132949 i dont mind taking a hit when its legitimate and true but this just aint true
9132950 i was not part of his inner circle and never wanted to be
9132951 the truth is i came to raleigh with my own set of values
9132952 theres no question if youre interested in traditional sorts of government and continuing along the same course their experience is better than mine if youre interested in change then i have some of that to offer
9132953 my goal is to try to reduce some of the bad things and increase some of the good things that government does
9132954 this is beyond just the stance of where we stand on the issues
9132955 it is who is the best qualified leader to lead this state who can develop the vision for the future who can implement that vision who can form coalitions to make it happen and who can change this culture of state government which has currently not been ethical and which has not been approachable
9132956 i am the one person in this race who has got that successful track record of leadership of implementing plans that we might not see the results for many years
9132957 the thing im proudest of all is the way teen smoking rates have come down
9132958 ive been fighting this for about a month now maybe a little bit longer
9132959 its just something we did because weve been struggling and you want to shake things up a little bit
9132960 i wouldnt be alive today if it wasnt for john
9132961 we want you all to stay here and keep the business going and keep it the way it was
9132962 i remember when i went down to get my business license here
9132963 there was this old lady behind the counter and when i told her what i wanted to open she turned around and hesitated
9132964 i thought here we go again but i remember her telling me you know i think you all will do well we dont have many of those things and that was the most refreshing moment of my career
9132965 i wanted to pass that along because this is my lifestyle i believe in this life

9133112 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9133113 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9133114 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9133115 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9133116 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9133117 this is why were seeing a significant increase in hro suppliers including offshore suppliers and offerings focused on the mid market buyer

9133119 it was east and west performing together for the glorification of god
9133120 for days the kitchens worked 24 hours to cope with over 50 000 plates of free vegetarian food which was distributed throughout the festival

9133130 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
9133131 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence

9133133 most clergy have had many opportunities to learn how to care for those who are dying but do they really know all they need to know about the options that are available for those who have died
9133134 were friends man busch said friday with a cheshire cats grin at auto club speedway
9133135 i even joke around with the guys amp ellipses that carl is
9133136 i might text him later and well go get an
9133137 oh wait he doesnt eat that stuff probably i dont know maybe salads
9133138 oh i love to see the games said jeff gordon laughing that hes not buschs best friend
9133139 i cant wait to see how it all plays out i thought last week was spectacular
9133140 i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him edwards said with a smile
9133141 if they can shoot barbs at each other and make fun of each other and harass each other and not let it affect them on the race track well thats the best of both worlds right there waltrip said
9133142 you mess with the bull you get the horns busch told wallace
9133143 there are other bulls in the garage and carl is one of them i think carl is in the catbirds seat he doesnt play carl has got an attitude too he just disguises it a lot better than kyle does
9133144 the problem is that when you have somebody that is 23 years old and is full of himself and having the kind of the year that hes having like kyle is its hard to get a message to him
9133145 i think its good for the sport aj allmendinger said
9133146 i got a front row seat of it after the race i wanted to go see what was going on after it i was trying to follow them i was pretty disappointed that kyle didnt go back after him
9133147 kyle would be the bad guy two totally different personalities but i think the fans respect what they are on the track and what theyre doing
9133148 i hope to be in there amp ellipses pretty soon and be the pc guy
9133149 then the locals punted out and on the eve of what was to be the most brilliant victory in the history of the school came the most horrible catastrophe that fate could send for it was in this play that leo caldwell our star halfback in making a tackle lost his life
9133150 i wasnt sure we would be able to do this
9133151 weve had five or six people basically running our government in a fashion that has been secretive in a fashion that has been inaccessible and sadly in a fashion in which weve had corrupt government
9133152 if she hasnt id ask why not but i think she clearly gives the impression that she has been by her role in health and her role in other areas and if there are certain areas where she hasnt been she should have been she should have been either trying to change this leadership change this culture or playing a role in it
9133153 what hes saying is the fact that the current administration has had a plethora of issues and the fact that the former speaker of the house went to jail paints me with the same brush hes trying to put me part and parcel with easley
9133154 i dont mind taking a hit when its legitimate and true but this just aint true
9133155 i was not part of his inner circle and never wanted to be
9133156 the truth is i came to raleigh with my own set of values
9133157 theres no question if youre interested in traditional sorts of government and continuing along the same course their experience is better than mine if youre interested in change then i have some of that to offer
9133158 my goal is to try to reduce some of the bad things and increase some of the good things that government does
9133159 this is beyond just the stance of where we stand on the issues
9133160 it is who is the best qualified leader to lead this state who can develop the vision for the future who can implement that vision who can form coalitions to make it happen and who can change this culture of state government which has currently not been ethical and which has not been approachable
9133161 i am the one person in this race who has got that successful track record of leadership of implementing plans that we might not see the results for many years
9133162 the thing im proudest of all is the way teen smoking rates have come down
9133163 im a hands on leader im 180 percent different from gov easley and i actually tell gov jim hunt im going to be a harder worker and a better governor than he was
9133164 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred of the liberal movement
9133165 but this was too good an opportunity to turn down
9133166 she started doing research when she inherited the property because she was concerned so much land was being cut up into small residential lots
9133167 right before camp they moved me from outside to middle and that was a surprise
9133168 but it worked out really well i had a great camp best camp since ive been here
9133169 they told me it would be best for the team because i was a natural fit i was cool with that
9133170 is that there wasnt one single day over the summer that he didnt come in watch film or talk to a coach his understanding of the playbook the schemes and the responsibilities has allowed him to become a very good player
9133171 if youre going to be really good at that position youve got to master it
9133172 and kennedy has taken to that role he takes pen and paper and writes down his mistakes he goes to the board and draws up his mistakes hes starting to understand what his job is to get everybody lined up and set to go
9133173 you check the audibles my reads have to be a lot faster and its a lot more physical because youre dealing with offensive linemen more but because im a physical player it ended up being a good move
9133174 i wouldnt be alive today if it wasnt for john
9133175 we want you all to stay here and keep the business going and keep it the way it was
9133176 somehow it makes me happy he was in a good space then
9133177 i remember when i went down to get my business license here
9133178 there was this old lady behind the counter and when i told her what i wanted to open she turned around and hesitated
9133179 i thought here we go again but i remember her telling me you know i think you all will do well we dont have many of those things and that was the most refreshing moment of my career
9133180 i wanted to pass that along because this is my lifestyle i believe in this life
9133181 we dont need a law for everything a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
9133182 if you stop and think about it jesus fed those 5 000 before he even talked to them
9133183 i knew there would be more than we could handle weve had calls every day
9133184 a lot of people may have medical care but dental care is a luxury for some people
9133185 it was good for all of us to pause despite being in the middle of moving our practice and to use the gifts weve been given to give back to the community
9133186 its a wonderful feeling and just a good thing to do
9133187 there was a lady who said she was willing to ride the bus with her grandchildren for an hour to get to the church
9133188 there are so many people who fall through the cracks they make too much money for medicaid but all their income goes to taking care of their children and buying food
9133189 weve prayed with several people who just needed someone to talk to
9133190 there is nothing in the world more important than the first game of the season
9133191 theres an awful lot of buzz and excitement about the program
9133192 i think our football program has done a good job of continuing to build momentum
9133193 its just one of those things where you turn on the film and it looks like he belongs at running back
9133194 i think this year ill be able to make a decision quicker because ill have it figured out in my head earlier
9133195 kentwan took a whole lot of pressure off me they double teamed him a lot
9133196 but im looking forward to double teams i feel like if you dont do it youre disrespecting me
9133197 wake up and realize the states not going to get it done
9133198 i was so upset i kept thinking i just hit a cat i just killed someones pet i called my boyfriend and i was just sobbing i never wanted to drive again
9133199 we thought there was a cat stuck up in a tree
9133200 you know it looks almost like a little cage in there
9133201 i dont know if he was scared or knocked out
9133202 because i checked my car thursday night and didnt hear anything or see anything wrong
9133203 im not much of a cat person but hes a sweet cat
9133204 he was licking my hand when i was trying to get him out and he followed me around he seems to love me even though i almost flattened him
9133205 if the companies who use boilers were not getting it from us they would have to clear cut trees to get it
9133206 there will always be material that cant be recycled the material we keep out now can add 12 to 15 years to the lifespan of the landfill so the benefit to us is being able to accept material for a longer period of time
9133207 solar energy and search engines cellphones and fuel cells dna sequencing and hollywood blockbusters
9133208 the institute of electrical and electronics engineers cites technologists working on
9133209 a nasa safety worker forcefully and incorrectly pried our badgeholder apart so he could remove the clips and then installed them backwards
9133210 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
9133211 we put the dog back there probably about eight minutes before it was taken
9133212 and then about 8 minutes after it was taken we noticed it was gone
9133213 its not a very good example to set for a child that will give him a bad life
9133214 how can you eat an animal youve named and raised
9133215 i think its going to break the description is just too good
9133216 the y definitely wanted to bring in some fitness events
9133217 this would have just been something different strongman is really popular right now and we just wanted to get something else out there something new
9133218 after this first event well see how it goes and maybe take some requests eventually this could be a two day event
9133219 were hoping that if we get a decent turn out we can hold two a year
9133220 we definitely want to encourage anyone whose interested just to come out
9133221 its not a huge event everybodys amateur and just want to have fun

9133276 even groups supportive of the preference system are dismayed by the unavailability of information
9133277 institutions are understandably afraid of litigation so they havent made their policies very public
9133278 whether underrepresented asian ethnicities e g cambodians laotians are given affirmative action consideration

9133313 land trusts for privacy amp profit using the illinois type land trust in other states
9133314 in the past a land trust was often part of creative deal structuring
9133315 now when they see a trust in the chain of title its a red flag theyre more nervous than in the past and they may think a buyer using a trust is engaged in some sort of fraud
9133316 there is no legitimate reason for someone to set up a land trust purely for investment reasons
9133317 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity

9133329 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9133330 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9133331 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9133332 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9133333 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9133334 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9133335 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9133336 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9133337 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9133338 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9133339 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9133340 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9133341 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9133342 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9133343 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9133344 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9133345 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9133346 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9133347 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9133348 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9133349 i was grateful to have all those months to prepare
9133350 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us

9133352 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
9133353 the police should have backed off after about 20 minutes the plane could have tailed him and he would still be here today
9133354 we dont know why he took the chase he had paid 4 000 for the bike and had it 12 months just a week before this happened he spent 600 having it repaired
9133355 how barbaric i cant believe any parent would do such a thing treating their little darling like a dog my children will never be put on a leash
9133356 it was a struggle getting into atlas and then i ended up sat by the door at the front because of the poor facilities if they had just got a portable ramp it could have been easily solved but they shouldnt get away with doing absolutely nothing
9133357 its annoying and humiliating when people are always having to help and ask if youre okay thats not the point of a night out disabled people should have access to all services on the same equal footing
9133358 we are delighted that mr fogerty won his case this is a significant sum for a small claims court
9133359 where premises have a physical feature that makes it impossible for a disabled person to use them reasonable adjustments have to be made disabled people should enjoy the freedom to use facilities and services it is shocking that in this day and age disabled people are still being humiliated like this
9133360 atlas bar has co operated in every way since we became aware of mr fogertys experience
9133361 having two members of my own family disabled this is a matter which is close to my heart
9133362 mcmahon came to him with both arms swinging to try to land a punch mr macdonald had to take hold of him and it ended up in a scuffle
9133363 he has no recollection and is aghast at what has taken place
9133364 its no wonder the kids are as unruly as they are today if the teachers are setting this kind of impression
9133365 we wanted 40p but we realised that fuel is coming down
9133366 drivers have been losing around 40 per week it has been very hard to be a taxi driver during the fuel crisis
9133367 it will be temporary as all the indications are fuel prices are falling the council thought 20p was not unreasonable in the circumstances
9133368 we are on the home stretch charlotte is just glad to be away from the hospital and once she has had her stitches removed she will be on the next flight home
9133369 she regressed terribly after last weeks operation and seemed to be confusing dreams with reality as she slept for about 20 hours a day
9133370 but well have to pay for the flights from crete with the funds we have raised because the insurance company wont pay up
9133371 people living locally will become so disheartened if this carries on it amazes me that the highways agency can be so inefficient
9133372 all this delay makes it very hard for tameside businesses using that route to make plans for the future
9133373 leigh had so much courage and strength she was an inspiration to me and to others
9133374 leigh is still very much a part of our family and always a treasured daughter sister and auntie everyone is so proud of her
9133375 i used to take a shortcut across a yard in failsworth on my way to primary school
9133376 i know that men working there cut asbestos sheets and handled asbestos materials in the yard but i had no idea that by walking through the yard i could have inadvertently got cancer
9133377 for a long time it has been the forgotten cancer the silent epidemic leighs case shows it cannot be seen as an old persons disease any longer
9133378 for somebody so young to die with all her dreams and ambitions seems so unjust
9133379 there is a big issue about asbestos in schools built in the post war period
9133380 when doors are slammed by young children or chairs are pushed against pipes it can disturb the asbestos this may have happened to leigh
9133381 the government has been scared of facing up to it because they dont want to create panic but we know for a fact there is still asbestos in schools and we need to identify who could be at risk
9133382 the purpose of these awards is to recognize special accomplishments made in the last year by members of exceed toastmasters club

9133384 i realized that some of the categories were not exactly obvious by their name alone heres what i had in mind when i decided on these award categories
9133385 there is nothing quite like being recognized by your peers
9133386 for me infertility was nothing but a metaphor for the fading sense of hope it was more like a spiritual infertility and it is a journey for trying to come to terms with an awakening of a possibility of hope

9133446 youll get used to her she likes you unlike the past singers that they sent her

9133488 opposes gay marriage constitutionally banned in alaska before her time but exercised a veto that essentially granted benefits to gay state employees and their partners
9133489 the governors veto does not signal any change or modification to her disagreement with the action and order by the alaska supreme court
9133490 its unconstitutional to require a couple to be married in order to get government employment benefits
9133491 supreme court unanimously rule d in october 2005 its unconstitutional to deny benefits to the same sex partners of public employees
9133492 anchorage officials begin steps to offer benefits state says it needs more time supreme court eventually gives until jan 1 2007 for state to comply with the ruling
9133493 act prohibiting the commissioner of administration from adopting allowing become law or implementing regulations that grant or extend employment related benefits to same sex partners of state employees and members of the state retirement systems unless expressly authorized by statute
9133494 the department of law advised me that this bill hb4001 is unconstitutional given the recent court order of december 19th mandating same sex benefits
9133495 the department of law advised me that this bill hb4001 is unconstitutional given the recent court order of december 19th mandating same sex benefits
9133496 with that in mind signing this bill would be in direct violation of my oath of office
9133497 the bill effectively eliminated the regulatory process as a way to comply with the courts order to provide same sex domestic partner benefits for state employees and members of state retirement systems
9133498 legally sufficient to authorize the commission of administration to expand state employee health benefits or change the retirement systems to provide benefits for same sex domestic partners
9133499 the supreme court has ordered adoption of the regulations by the state of alaska to begin providing benefits january 1
9133500 we have no more judicial options we may disagree with the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and follow the constitution
9133501 i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman but the supreme court has spoken and the state will abide
9133502 the alaska supreme court ruled the state couldnt deny spousal
9133503 e lected officials cant defy the court when it comes to how rights are applied she said but she would support a ballot question that would deny benefits to homosexual couples i believe that honoring the family structure is that important palin said she said she doesnt know if people choose to be gay
9133504 palin said that when voters approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman eight years ago many believed they were also implying that a gay partner shouldnt get state benefits i wouldnt oppose at all the voters going back to the ballot box to clarify that she said during a ktuu channel 2 debate sunday
9133505 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9133506 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down

9133514 some people think dr king is being presumptuous speaking there at the lincoln memorial
9133515 for bill clinton and for anyone in the democratic party its a very tricky case taking on john mccain and trying to rough him up
9133516 when john mccain was sitting in a prison in hanoi bill clinton was writing letters to his rotc commander and trying to get out of the draft which he did successfully
9133517 t he next thing you know hes running for the president of the united presidency of the united states when you know a four year job when hes never held a job that long in his life
9133518 s ome women by the way are named that and its accurate
9133519 member of sen john mccains panel of outside advertising consultants
9133520 wanted to split iraq into three different countries by ethnic lines
9133521 that would have created a civil war he did not want to win
9133522 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
9133523 t he central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues
9133524 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
9133525 theres also this issue that on april 18 she palin gave birth to a baby with down syndrome the baby is just slightly more than 4 months old now children with down syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9133526 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with down syndrome would you ask the same question
9133527 does it make it harder for joe biden in a debate to be tough on a woman lets talk about gender politics for a moment
9133528 absolutely you know hes now this big bad bully right
9133529 y ou cant be aggressive against a woman candidate on stage or youre in big trouble
9133530 these men once considered a security threat to iraqi civilians as well as coalition and iraqi forces have completed their internment and can go on to lead productive lives

9133534 last night while the networks slept the cynics wept and the future revealed itself the occasion was the extraordinary keynote speech by barack obama a formerly obscure illinois state senator who is poised to become the most important democrat in america
9133535 so eloquently so seamlessly that there was no sense that he was giving his audience a lecture
9133536 the forty two year old multi culti pol with the harvard law degree and appealing articulate manner would have stolen the show last night had there been a show to steal

9133553 yes i would like to see alaskas infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9133554 i do support the infrastructure projects that are on tap here in the state of alaska that our congressional delegations worked hard for
9133555 directed the department of transportation and public facilities to look for the most fiscally responsible alternative for access to the ketchikan airport and gravina island
9133556 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9133557 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9133558 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9133559 todd and i are so proud of him and all the fine men and women serving this country in uniform
9133560 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere

9133575 republican john mccain introduced first term alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate today a stunning selection of a fellow maverick designed to get an edge in the increasingly competitive white house race
9133576 t he several years shes been in public life has been that of a maverick someone taking on the good ol boys every time one party runs the show it gets corrupt and she was challenging it
9133577 im thinking he likes this idea that shes also a bit of a maverick
9133578 mccain chooses maverick alaska governor to be his vice president
9133579 in choosing palin mccain also doubles down on the maverick argument palin is the face of reform in the republican party nationally and is clearly not of washington a key element of her biography given how negative voter sentiment toward the nations capital is currently

9133602 there is no new contract involved in what is a service upgrade at the same time the ap will be working with the spokesman review and other papers to help resolve concerns they may have during the rollout of the new member choice packaging and pricing plan which will provide newspaper members with greatly expanded basic news coverage
9133603 will not be executing a new contract reflecting the changes as required by the ap in the new member choice program the new contractual arrangement represents a continued and material shift by the ap of separating services from the basic package so that some services will be available only by signing up for supplemental programs thus ap services that formerly were part of a basic plan will now only be available through a supplemental plan approach this dilutes the value of the basic breaking news plan and constitutes a material change in the quality and breadth of the services offered by the ap under the basic contract
9133604 on that basis the old contract will expire dec 31 and well not sign a new one in a sense its not a cancellation at all but a decision to decline signing any new contracts

9133740 california is the nations biggest consumer of gasoline 45 million gallons a day plus 10 million gallons of diesel that makes us the third biggest petroleum consuming entity in the world behind on the united states and china so theres a gusher of hypocrisy here the state that is the biggest consumer of gasoline in the nation but produces less than 40 of what it uses is opposed to drilling for more oil off its shores were slackers not pulling our weight

9133747 the skynet project is a surveillance system to monitor the tibetans and the temples in the entire ganzi region
9133748 we also know that now all tibetans in tibet need the local governments approval to go to other places including going out of town to shop
9133749 everything would be a leap in the dark socialism is the renunciation of rational economy
9133750 the eventual victory of liberty is inevitable because only liberty is functional for modern man there is no need therefore for libertarians to thirst maniacally for instant action and instant victory and then to fall into bleak despair when that instant victory is not forthcoming reality and therefore history is on our side
9133751 i dont care what the hell else happens i just want the diamondbacks to win the division and make a quick first round exit
9133752 heres the problematic nature of the situation the los angeles angels of anaheim formerly just the anaheim angels and formerly the california angels have a compulsive tendency to obliterate the opposition in the primary seasonal region of the baseball calendar but stumble off of a 30 story building in parsippany new jersey during the schedule of baseball events that occur in the future with respect to the said primary seasonal region
9133753 but we got a long way to go a long journey when you get in the playoffs everything is going to be different we could win 100 plus games and it does not matter when you get to the postseason you got to change you got to be totally different any mistake you make youre going home
9133754 but instead we keep hearing from the republicans about poor poor john mccain and about the poor poor republican party
9133755 anyone who thinks this is a good choice is totally out of touch
9133756 to pick up the votes of women who supported hillary for president
9133757 it takes more to win the votes of disillusioned hillary voters than a pair of ovaries
9133758 i wasntt sure i would vote for obama i was actually considering voting for mccain im glad he mccain showed his lack of judgment early enough to bring me back to my senses
9133759 the palin pick shows that were the party of change
9133760 i didnt know who to vote for but now im convinced its obama

9133765 but the driver hit the gas and i mean he hit the gas in the next instant i was on the ground clutching my knee in pain
9133766 this man not only tried to kill me and my students he tried to kill the best of our future he failed only through poor execution

9133772 knorbert the piglet has been dropped as the mascot of fortis bank after it decided to stop giving piggy banks to children for fear of offending muslims
9133773 first they came for piglet and i did not speak out because i was not a disney character and if i was id be more of an eeyore then they came for the three little pigs and babe and by the time i realized the western world had turned into a 24 7 looney tunes it was too late because there was no porky pig to stammer all folks and bring the nightmare to an end
9133774 with the number of homophobic attacks rising in the dutch metropolis amsterdam officials are commissioning a study to determine why moroccan men are targeting the citys gays
9133775 half of the crimes were committed by men of moroccan origin and researchers believe they felt stigmatized by society and responded by attacking people they felt were lower on the social ladder another working theory is that the attackers may be struggling with their own sexual identity
9133776 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same
9133777 we create the threats why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its a fact that were over there that we create these crises
9133778 the last thing i want my son to think about police is that they want to hurt him so i tried to hide his face
9133779 all i could feel was mama bear do whatever you want to do to me but i need to get my son out safe
9133780 they said if you dont show us id and get your picture taken we will arrest you and take you away
9133781 they never said what the basis for arrests would be we were waiting for a meeting for gods sake i cannot tell you how much like a police state that felt to me
9133782 this isnt the way we do things in st paul
9133783 i dont want the city to get sucked into something that the sheriffs office is concocting

9133785 they need about a half a trillion dollars in borrowing authority and they need a vehicle to own these banks while we triage them and sell them
9133786 if we are way over 1990s levels by say the third quarter then i would tell you theres going to be some institutions that may not be able to raise private capital and may need a bridge
9133787 we dont think this credit cycle has bottomed out yet
9133788 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and as i said i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
9133789 its going to be a bigger problem now than it was in the first half of this year but its going to continue on for probably at least a nine month period
9133790 oh that man is half white hes ok with me
9133791 while i do not intend to vote for barack obama my decision is not based on his skin color but rather on the
9133792 just so you know we think bush dare i say it is a better president than obama would ever be
9133793 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
9133794 for everyone saying how bad bush is he has kept your sorry a safe he has kept his promise to protect your right to freedom of speech
9133795 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree

9133800 she can talk about the challenges of raising five kids with the girls and talk fishing with the boys with a special needs son shes had to be stronger than most mothers
9133801 today we found out that the republican nominee for vice president is governor sarah palin i have watched all the debates after her acceptance speech and no one brought up the fact that she in front of a worldwide audience broke operational security the military prides itself on she announced the mos of her son serving in the army and went on to say the exact date and the country her sons unit will deploy too she has not only endangered the life of her son but all the other soldiers in his unit senator john mccain never talked about his own sons service for that very reason i think it shows the lack of judgment on the part of mccains camp to not screen her speech and shows her own inexperience on the national stage for a candidate who prides himself on national security his vice presidential choice just blew that argument out of the water so why are we not talking about this issue
9133802 i have to go to various websites to get all sides to this vp issue
9133803 a u s air strike south of herat in western afghanistan has killed more than 50 innocent civilians including women and children

9133814 but like i said im most excited because when i was making this album i wanted to find someone who was really talented and get them to write a treatment and just leave it alone and let it fly and thats exactly what were doing here

9133874 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister

9133955 save 50 pounds of paper a year just use a bidet to clean your rear
9133956 t he medina message is not the fundamental universal eternal message of islam that founding message is from mecca so the reformation of islam must be based on a return to the mecca message in order to reconcile the mecca and medina messages into a single system muslim jurists have said that some of the medina verses have abrogated the corresponding earlier verses from mecca although the abrogation did take place and it was logical and valid jurisprudence at one time it was a postponement not a permanent abrogation
9133957 the mecca verses should now be made the basis of the law and the medina verses should be abrogated this counter abrogation will result in the total conciliation between islamic law and the modern development of human rights and civil liberties in this sense we reformers are superfundamentalists
9133958 in its origin the koran is a syro aramaic liturgical book with hymns and extracts from scriptures which might have been used in sacred christian services in the second place one may see in the koran the beginning of a preaching directed toward transmitting the belief in the sacred scriptures to the pagans of mecca in the arabic language its socio political sections which are not especially related to the original koran were added later in medina at its beginning the koran was not conceived as the foundation of a new religion it presupposes belief in the scriptures and thus functioned merely as an inroad into arabic society
9133959 in this way all the verses of persuasion though they constitute the primary or original principle were abrogated or repealed by the verses of compulsion jihad this exception was necessitated by the circumstances of the time and the inadequacy of the human capability to discharge properly the duty of freedom at that time
9133960 some muslim scholars believe that islamic wars were purely defensive wars a mistaken belief prompted by their keenness to refute claims by the orientalists that islam spread by means of the sword in fact the sword was used to curtail the abuse of freedom islam used persuasion for thirteen years in propagating its clearly valid message for the individual and the community when the addressees failed to discharge properly the duties of their freedom they lost this freedom and the prophet was appointed as their guardian until they came of age however once they embraced the new religion and observed the sanctity of life and property and the social claims of their kith and kin as they had been instructed the sword was suspended and abuses of freedom were penalized according to new laws hence the development of islamic sharia law and the establishment of a new type of government in justifying the use of the sword we may describe it as a surgeons lancet and not a butchers knife when used with sufficient wisdom mercy and knowledge it uplifted the individual and purified society
9133961 suffering death by the sword in this life is really an aspect of suffering hell in the next life since both are punishments for disbelief whoever adds to his own disbelief by inciting others to disbelief or to shun the path of god must be suppressed before he takes up arms in the cause of disbelief
9133962 islams original principle is freedom but the islamic religion was revealed to a society in which slavery was an integral part of the socioeconomic order it was also a society that was shown in practice to be incapable of properly exercising its freedom and therefore its individual members needed guidance hence the consequent enactment of jihad in islamic jihad the muslims first had to offer to the unbelievers the new religion if they refused to accept it they had the second option of paying jizyah and living under muslim government while practicing their own religion and enjoying personal security if they also refused the option of jizyah the muslims would fight them and if victorious take some of them as slaves thereby adding to the number of those already in slavery
9133963 if an individual is invited to become the slave of god but refuses such refusal is symptomatic of ignorance that calls for a period of training
9133964 the texts in islam distinguish themselves from the texts of other religions by encouraging violence and aggression against people with other religious beliefs to a larger degree there are also straightforward calls for terror this has long been a taboo in the research into islam but it is a fact that we need to deal with
9133965 if it is correct that many muslims view the koran as the literal words of god which cannot be interpreted or rephrased then we have a problem
9133966 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
9133967 throughout history rather than celebrating such biblical passages jews and christians have regarded them as a problem to be solved while interpretations of these passages differ widely among jews and christians from the beginning of rabbinic judaism and christianity one understanding has remained dominant among virtually all believers these passages are not commands for all generations to follow and if they have any applicability it is only in a spiritualized parabolic sense
9133968 the consensus view among jews and christians for many centuries is that unless you happen to be a hittite girgashite amorite canaanite perizzite hivite or jebusite these biblical passages simply do not apply to you the scriptures record gods commands to the israelites to make war against particular people only however this may be understood and however jarring it may be to modern sensibilities it does not amount to any kind of marching orders for believers thats one principal reason why jews and christians havent formed terror groups around the world that quote the bible to justify killing non combatants

9133973 you dont see any townships anywhere else in the world not even anywhere else in africa
9133974 a miserable and lonely death on a mat on the stone floor of a prison cell
9133975 i have no definitive answers our company espouses the view that tourism can be benevolent and benign and be a force for developing a common humanity i guess in depth research would have to be conducted to verify that but my anecdotal experience is definitely that it is the tourist voyeur in the townships that imposes the issues locals appear to have little issue with the subject in our port elizabeth experience anyway
9133976 our school fees are r40 00 per year and most of them arent paid because 80 of my parents are not working
9133977 with us at the school its we have a library because we work with calabash tours we get the tourists and we charge twenty rand for people who come here we offer coffee tea drinks and rosterie which is our african bread it was served with jam delicious
9133978 we use that money to run the school because we dont get funds from the department what they do is they give us a paper budget and that is never enough you dont get funds to pay accounts like the telephone account the school has to make sure that it has its own money to pay for that
9133979 we dont wait for the department we go out and do things for ourselves
9133980 and now you can see the massive impact that tourism has on the school
9133981 i would be sad if calabash tours was to withdraw its efforts
9133982 and even the community they look after the tourists because they know we have meetings with the community and we talk about the problems that we have and the community benefits indirectly because its benefiting their kids
9133983 we always look forward to having tourists at the school
9133984 our timetable is flexible and we always know in advance because calabash tours is very organised
9133985 theres not that feeling the feedback that we get from parents because what benefits their kids becomes very important to them is only praise
9133986 we dont feel that its taking us astray or that it derailing us from the programme that we normally have as a school
9133987 i would want them to see how beneficial tourism is and not necessarily how the school benefits from them i would want them to benefit from the school as well for coming here they should learn something new that they were not aware of before as we learn something new from them
9133988 and of course culture wise and in terms of history its always interesting to meet people from somewhere else
9133989 as much as we gain a lot from them we believe they gain as much from us as well
9133990 reflect the departments firm commitment to two goals that i believe we share safeguarding the attorney client privilege which is so central to our criminal justice system and preserving the departments ability to investigate corporate wrongdoing effectively
9133991 the revised guidelines are a step in the right direction but they leave many problems unresolved so that legislation will still be necessary
9133992 the justice departments track record of five different policies in ten years cries out for a permanent legislative solution that cannot be revised at the whim of each new deputy attorney general

9134000 weve had a lot of requests for street fighter iv on wii

9134002 if im still alive in the next three months we can talk again that opens up a whole other can of worms which is people instantly expecting it to be one to one swing controls and i dont know if wed be able to get it to the pinpoint accuracy that a game with this level of design requires so youd have to make gigantic surfaces you can swing onto rather than really tight skill based areas and that would shift more toward casual and bionic commando has never really be a game for casual players its one of those ideas on paper thats like yes the wii controller will work with bionic commando but when you actually try to design it out its like maybe maybe not i dont know

9134163 we just didnt know how much better eighty two wins is a big moment and i want this to be the standard of what we do to get that number on an annual basis
9134164 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9134165 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9134166 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9134167 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well
9134168 id rather be in a situation where you have a lot of veterans back
9134169 it is a positive for us both offensively and defensively we have to go into the game with a broad based game plan two to three series in you get a good idea of your game plan
9134170 ive never been that that nostalgic type of thing but not that it wont be exciting and all that
9134171 this is a new team a new era and a new season
9134172 ive liked the way theyve worked they understand what we want for the most part
9134173 its a lot of people that stepped up on the d line who are more vocal now especially me
9134174 were ready for that and know teams are going to try to run the ball down our throats
9134175 other than those 4 300 seats which are going to subsidize everybody else the prices are not
9134176 and remember 24 000 plus seats will have no price increase at all
9134177 were not going to push it wed like him to go and hes open minded to it but we wont do anything in any way shape or form to force that issue
9134178 however i can also tell you this right now people keep talking about the investment we have in him 22 million the next two years thats not the issue the issue is that we think hes a heck of a pitcher who has struggled this year but has a chance to be a heck of a pitcher again
9134179 this isnt somebody who hasnt done anything hes done something we think we have a good pitcher on our hands what were trying to do is trying to get him prepared to be a successful pitcher in 2009
9134180 but again and this is the no 1 thing were doing everything we can to get him ready for the 2009 season
9134181 everybody needs more work i always want to play but you have to be smart and not jump head first into something
9134182 i wouldnt say its been a nightmare were just trying to break stuff down and rebuild it
9134183 but its not been a nightmare im a major league ball player ive seen worse things than playing baseball in the minors
9134184 i saw a guy who was coming back a guy who definitely knows what hes doing he threw some balls at 86 miles an hour some at 88 and one at 89 had a curve and a good split
9134185 i saw a lot of what i saw with chicago in that last year when garcia won 17 games in 2006 for the white sox
9134186 he used to throw 94 or 95 miles an hour do i think thats ever going to happen again
9134187 thats probably questionable but im not necessarily looking for that you dont have to throw that hard he wasnt a real hard thrower that last year in chicago but he still was a very successful pitcher
9134188 this is another project we have no made a final decision about whether garcia will join the tigers in september were discussing some options but theres been nothing cemented along those lines nothing has been decided
9134189 and i know how he competes but the guy has pitched only five innings in the tigers organization the arm was free though
9134190 i learned a long time ago that when you say it will be a few more games
9134191 the next day a player comes in and hes fine

9134195 you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out
9134196 that was great we thought we knew all there was about new business pitching
9134197 i learned more in one day than i expected great perspectives and tons of info

9134218 im just trying to do as well as i can during the opportunity im getting
9134219 if that leads to something great if not its out of my control
9134220 coming into the season we didnt consider him as a starter
9134221 because we thought we were set hes pitched very well but its way too early to start making commitments that you dont know if you can keep thats the worst thing you can do
9134222 nobody knows whats going to unfold for 2009 what you do is say zach miner stepped in did a good job and accept it for what its worth
9134223 the biggest part of that inning was marcus thames busting his tail to get to first on that play
9134224 without him running that hard the ball gets picked up and hes out but that opened a big inning for us it probably frustrated starter kyle davies a little bit and he made a couple of mistakes

9134233 we are doing no price gouging whatsoever and we would be supportive of catching folks that do
9134234 it gives the rest of us a bad name if anything we are making much less money currently than we would have even two weeks ago before this storm came up
9134235 some stations have tank storage that holds two weeks worth of gas where typically our tanks are 24 to 30 hours so the price turns over pretty much every day
9134236 we have to pass along the price we get from the refineries people will complain for example that it went from 3 50 to 3 75 but they dont understand we had a 38 cent increase in the last three days we cant afford to sell for too much below cost and keep the doors open
9134237 unconscionable if the rise in price represents a gross disparity from the average price of that commodity during the 30 days prior to the declared emergency
9134238 we consider each situation on a case by case basis

9134408 what is the most accurate translation of the holy scriptures
9134409 new world translation of the holy scriptures printed by the watchtower bible amp tract society
9134410 truth in translation accuracy and bias in english translations of the new testament
9134411 since several individuals and institutions have addressed me concerning the following matter i make this statement henceforth it will be sent instead of a personal letter to anyone appealing to me to clarify my position 1 several years ago i quoted the so called new world translation among several bible versions in articles that dealt with purely philological pertaining to the study science of languages questions such as the rendition of the causative hiphil of the participle qotel in the course of my comparative studies i found the nwt rather illuminating it gives evidence of an acute awareness of the structural characteristics of hebrew as well as an honest effort to faithfully render these in the target english language a translation is bound to be a compromise and as such its details are open to criticism this applies to the nwt too in the portion corresponding to the hebrew bible however i have never come upon an obviously erroneous rendition which would find its explanation in a dogmatic bias repeatedly i have asked the antagonists of the watchtower bible who turned to me for a clarification of my views to name specific verses for a renewed scrutiny this was either not done or else the verse submitted e g genesis 4 13 6 3 10 9 15 5 18 20 etc did not prove the point namely a tendentious with a purposed aim biased translation 2 i beg to make clear that i do not feel any sympathy for any sect and this includes jehovahs witnesses of course my mistrust is not directed against the individual member of such sect but rather against the organization that manipulates him and puts forward its dogmas and rules as the ultimate truth it should be conceded however that the groups and organizations that fiercely oppose the witnesses do not behave any better on the whole synagogue church and mosque also tend to exhibit dogmatic arrogance coupled with intolerance of and enmity with other confessions 3 i cannot help expressing my deep conviction that the search for truth will never benefit by linguistic quibble whether the author using the word naephaesh denoted soul as opposed to body lev 17 11 or meant something else whether almah means virgin or young woman is 7 14 is of great interest to philologists and historians of religion an argument for or against blood transfusion or the virgin birth of jesus respectively cannot be derived from it 4 obviously it is mans destiny to make the choice of his way a matter of conscience and to the best of his knowledge there exists no simple set of rules such as could be learned from the mouth of a guru or the pages of an ancient venerable book those who pretend to act according to an infallible guide more often than not interpret the texts in accordance with their preconceived wishes and notions
9134412 the role of theology and bias in bible translation with a special look at the new world translation of jehovahs witnesses
9134413 the immediate context is the final criterion for what words should be used and the truth is the nwt translators time and again appeal to the context
9134414 i will make the wisdom of the wise men perish and the intelligence of the intellectual men i will shove aside
9134415 18 let no one be seducing himself if anyone among you thinks he is wise in this system of things let him become a fool that he may become wise
9134416 jehovah knows that the reasonings of the wise men are futile
9134417 excuse me jehovah but i am not a fluent speaker neither since yesterday nor since before that nor since your speaking to your servant for i am slow of mouth and slow of tongue
9134418 who is jehovah that i should follow him pharaoh was actually considered to be the living god to the egyptians what weight did moses carry when confronting the god of the most powerful empire of its day when discussion ensued regarding this amongst the populace what do you suppose the news that spread said did it say he was an expert on religion and that the entirety of the egyptian royal house was in error along with all his sorcerers priests and prophets it is much more likely that the news media of that time word of mouth said he was insane misinterpreting signs and portents deliberately lying and deceitful they most certainly said he was wrong and faced with the fact of the plagues apparent to all the only reason they could provide was the weight of their authority ad hominem attacks and ridicule what of job his friends came to comfort him with the teachings of the pentateuch citing scriptures and trying to apply them to his affliction the majority of them with the generally accepted interpretation of the day accused him based on scripture what was the end result jehovah cursed them because job was faithful and though he was alone in his interpretation of scripture he was still right of course there is the example of jesus himself was he the son of a wealthy or influential family was he an accredited scholar a professor or clergyman not at all he was the son of a carpenter he was himself a carpenter there is no indication at all that he was in any way extraordinary as regards his level of education or political ties but were his teachings popular well accepted by the learned men of the pharisees the saducees scribes lawmakers and religious officials of that time most definitely not these educated men whose philosophies were the standard of the day actually sought to kill him many times bringing him before the courts because his teachings were sacrilegious blasphemous and heretical the son of mary and the brother of james and joseph and judas and simon is it not and his sisters are here with us are they not

9134437 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9134438 on his 72nd birthday sen mccain has chosen a vp based on her political currency rather than her ability to lead our country in a crisis if john mccain wins in november hell be the oldest president in u s history and sarah palin would be a heartbeat away from being our commander in chief its not only fair but critical in this case to ask if shes up for the job of commander in chief we just cant afford a gamble like this with our future
9134439 gov palin is one of many millions of americans who have used marijuana and gone on to live productive wildly successful lives that she used marijuana is no big deal but what is a big deal is that she thinks that the 100 million americans who have used marijuana including herself belong in jail that wouldnt be good for her kids perhaps most importantly alaska is one of 12 states that allow the medical use of marijuana and one in five americans currently live in those states the gop ticket should embrace the time honored republican principle of local control by promising to end the federal governments war on sensible medical marijuana laws in both red and blue states

9134450 its purpose satisfied the sheriff and i that chief hoving was not trying to discourage or prevent donovan from doing his job
9134451 it was my opinion and the sheriffs opinion that it would be potentially very destructive to give credence to donovans complaints by way of a formal investigation and an investigative report not only to the members of the narcotics unit but to chief hoving
9134452 hoving had warned donovan to overlook procedures under the threat of some kind of punitive or disciplinary action
9134453 there would be no means of determining the truth of that statement without placing donovan and hoving alone in a room because sgt donovan indicated that hoving only made such threats to dissuade him from complying with policy in the privacy of his office

9134579 zippy and i have been together for 10 years which is longer than ive had a girlfriend
9134580 its very hard you have to try to find the chemistry and try to find the right people that you know are going to be right for your operation what your goals and what your expectations are
9134581 knowing how closely were going to be working with the hendrick organization it has to be someone that the hendrick organization feels comfortable with to work with their people too theres a lot of equation other than saying i like this guy its not near that easy
9134582 when i get to the race track on the weekends im going to be a driver im not going to be an owner
9134583 my job on friday saturday and sunday is to get in behind the wheel and to do what ive done all my life
9134584 obviously monday through thursday is a little different role and will be a little more hectic but the weekends will be the same for me as far as my role and what i do
9134585 i feel great about the effort thats being put forth
9134586 im proud of my team im proud of zippy im proud of our guys and how hard they are digging but we just havent found that one thing or two things that we need right now
9134587 the great thing about this organization is that these guys wont quit it doesnt matter if with two races to go were 12th in the points they are still going to keep working just as hard as we are right now you keep doing the same things that weve always done for 10 years thats won us 33 races and two championships you keep fighting and you keep working hard and you hope you find it but right now were not where we need to be
9134588 i knew that it was a possibility nascar is a sport that is sponsor dependent i know gem has been working hard to find sponsorship im amazed that they found all the sponsorship this year mr gillett is paying for some of it out of his pocket i dont expect them to do that every year for sure its a shock to learn someone else is taking your spot but they are still working to get a fourth car out there a lot of teams want to go to four cars and this is one of them hopefully it works out if it doesnt for me its a bonus ive enjoyed the year so much i hope to do it for many years if i dont then i understand ive been on the other side of the sponsorship opportunities with players they used to sponsor me in champ car and because of my personality and where i was from it fit the bill perfectly so i got a ride for nine years over there at players i was kind of locked in for eight nine years this time im on the other side and im the one getting the boot its part of racing im not pissed off i kind of expected it i still hope they find it sponsorship they really want to find it with the economy and the way things are reed just fits the bill better thats fine too
9134589 no i dont regret anything i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine in the grand scheme of things looking back on it i dont even think there was really anything that was that bad about last week i thought it was just real good hard racing and what happened afterwards is stuff that happens at every short track all around the country every week the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to thats the only bad part
9134590 whenever they have any kind of special event that you dont have to win a pole to be in it thats usually good for us because im not a very good qualifier i havent read all the stuff but i guess ive only been a part of that race once maybe twice you want to be a part of every event so if they make a different way for qualifying thats probably good for us

9134619 once you determine if youre going to have an office and a secretary at that point you can determine what that expense is going to be for the remainder of the year and move what you need for salary and rent and what have you out of contingency

9134683 weve got enough things that weve got to figure out at enough spots i just dont see the value of putting these guys out there and losing one
9134684 but at the same time you expect the next guy to get plugged in because during the regular season you never know what will happen
9134685 the citizens are appalled and they are right to be appalled
9134686 i do not believe that public servants should be suing the people they serve its a fundamental problem that breaks the trust
9134687 as sheriff i am embarrassed at the filing of the civil tort against the mies family by two law enforcement officers
9134688 i recognize that there are situations and circumstances which in my opinion could warrant the filing of a civil lawsuit this is absolutely not one of those cases
9134689 i am appalled that you would be so insensitive as to add insult to injury to this family this action is a disgrace to the entire law enforcement community
9134690 i cant even imagine the stress level that poor woman has gone through
9134691 it helps us to feel we are not alone in our struggle
9134692 faced the challenge of creating a display to celebrate the strengths of colusa countys agriculture industry while paying homage to the state fairs theme the state fair goes hollywood
9134693 decided to create a display honoring the world traveling seed stars of the county watermelon cucumber pumpkin and tomato
9134694 the boys were assigned the task of drawing caricatures of the seeds characteristic of their ages and this era they drew sharp images worthy of video game or cartoon network debut
9134695 each seed is depicted true to its color in real life
9134696 once completed the colusa county traveling stars were aptly named diamond crested cucumber seed a rapper patrick pumpkin seed a rough tough guy rocky tomato seed a boxer and waldo watermelon seed a happy guy why because who can be unhappy when eating watermelon
9134697 we are saddened that the fine work of these young men is now cast under a cloud of unintended racism
9134698 we ask that you applaud their hard work and know that they were working to honor colusa county with their artistic depiction of a genre of ag products produced in stellar quantities by the county seeds
9134699 i applaud these students efforts but they probably never had the benefit of a black history class
9134700 as a happy black slave eating watermelon if the students were presented with that history they might have drawn waldo watermelon seed a little differently
9134701 by having this agreement it allows us to really look beyond the boundaries of our city to put these businesses in the right location
9134702 we see this as a historic moment were looking for other deals in the future
9134703 partnering with cities is the wave of the future for the county
9134704 its really a partnership that has developed and we hope to do that on a variety of issues
9134705 given the current financial crisis facing the city and county sales tax sharing agreements and ultimately functional consolidation is likely inevitable
9134706 you have separate police forces why not figure out a better way to do this both have planning departments why not have just one handle it
9134707 minimize the endless insidious competition over which side of the boundary the next auto mall will be located
9134708 we want to set a new standard in terms of response to the context they are in
9134709 we just spent eight years getting over the closure of that road
9134710 i dont want this to push us back eight years
9134711 i dont want to see anything on natoma street except the cows and those turkeys
9134712 but i dont think fish and game was very fortunate in the way the regulations were crafted
9134713 refrain from any catch and release fishing that specifically targets salmon
9134714 i believe they shouldnt be fished period especially in the dire situation we are fighting now
9134715 if people are fishing to them they are harassing them
9134716 if the practice continues the harassment will cause some problems for the spawning family of fish
9134717 its just people ignoring the intent of the salmon closure
9134718 the average fisherman out there has a responsibility to make sure his practices promote the regeneration and repopulation of the fish
9134719 its not just up to fish and game it has to do with everybody
9134720 its a 27 000 square foot building and will be able to house our administrative offices our laboratory and our equipment
9134721 i enter almost every competition and drive it here early in the morning then i hang around and watch the judging drive home and start all over again
9134722 its exciting i guess its the thrill of the competition i test my recipes all year just for this
9134723 it has a hint of allspice and hot cocoa flavor
9134724 ive always been competitive i keep track of judges comments to improve my own entries its very rewarding to have a judge decide that youve made the best in the state you know your friends and family always tell you its the best but it really means something when you have that ribbon then you know for sure its the best

9134767 met succes smokkelden mensen uit de omgeving toen toch eten en drinken naar binnen
9134768 what is it about the gates of hell that compels people to wander into them
9134769 hey whats he gonna do borrow a cup of sugar from satan
9134770 no hes gonna borrow a cup of smuckers raspberry jam its almost like real fruit
9134771 what is it about the gates of hell that compels people to wander into them
9134772 hey whats he gonna do borrow a cup of sugar from satan
9134773 no hes gonna borrow a cup of smuckers raspberry jam its almost like real fruit
9134774 it was selfishness lust pure plain and simple pervertedness it was deliberate and callous what you did there was no misjudging on your part what you did to me
9134775 when the sun shines it will shine brightly with you out of office god knows every woman every time each and everything you ever did god knows the truth and now so does everyone else
9134776 a mentor someone i wanted to be like one day
9134777 i grew up with a great amount of respect for you as a person and a judge
9134778 there are a lot more of your victims out there who do not want to speak up this has been going on too long and it has to stop now
9134779 there is no one above the law and sooner or later justice had to prevail
9134780 sexual harassment in the workplace will not be tolerated hopefully this will be a turning point for the community
9134781 i am both disappointed and angry that any public servant particularly a judge would use their power and influence to gratify their personal desires in such a predatory manner
9134782 james blackstock not only disgraced himself and his family while subjecting countless women myself included to unwarranted humiliation and assault over the years but he tainted the bench from which he sat and violated the trust placed in him by the public
9134783 what is enough for what he did and for how long he did it
9134784 for me im glad its over im glad its all come out into the open
9134785 he has his family to think about and thats what he was doing
9134786 otherwise it would have gone to trial and there would have been a lot of things back and forth nobody would have come out ahead
9134787 there were a lot of people who were disappointed he hurt a lot of people and he betrayed the public trust he betrayed his fellow judges and he betrayed his oath of office we take that seriously it wasnt the easy decision and it wasnt a popular decision but it was the right decision
9134788 everybodys heart goes out to the victims and the judges family but he knew better for a long time theres no malice here just really sad disappointment it had to come to this
9134789 trent cotchin is going to be a very good player and rhys palmer gets a lot of the ball and is already starting to get tagged but if i was going to choose one it would probably be rioli
9134790 he has fitted into that team kicked some freakish goals but also does the one per centers the tackling
9134791 to play in such a good side and play well every game is a fair effort and he gets the best small backman every week but if palmer or cotchin win they will be equally deserving
9134792 bradshaw kicked four on me and two came from free kicks but he got two late ones which hurt me a bit franklin kicked 3 2 on me and i played on him the whole game so that wasnt too bad given how many shots he takes
9134793 i havent got a licence but it hasnt bothered me it only takes me half an hour on the train and tram
9134794 just occasionally some people recognise me when i get the train to games but not that much im pretty skinny 86kg 192cm and most people dont know me
9134795 they steer clear of playing me on the really big blokes like jonathan brown i played on barry hall for a quarter but stef martin is 198cm and probably the strongest bloke in the club so he gets the big ones
9134796 and next year jared rivers will come back into the side so there might not be a position for me there
9134797 i had played up forward in pre season and bails coach dean bailey has said i could even move into midfield or wing in the future
9134798 hopefully i can become a swing man like adam hunter maybe even leading out of the square at full forward im pretty quick maybe in the top three or four in the club behind blokes like daniel bell and aaron davey maybe i could use my pace up forward
9134799 when i first came i was surprised at how normal the players are
9134800 i thought they would have massive egos but they all want to work together not out for themselves you think of the afl being big business
9134801 we definitely have some good young players addam maric will be a really good player so will cale morton austin wonaeamirri james frawley simon buckley jonesy nathan jones is only 20
9134802 shane valenti has done it the hard way back through the vfl stef martin at full back ricky petterd hasnt played much due to injury
9134803 jack grimes is very promising after a long term injury he was picked as captain of his under 18 club ahead of matthew kreuzer and trent cotchin and blokes like michael newton who could be anything if he works at it
9134804 the blokes we have out like brock mclean jared rivers brent moloney russell robertson they are leaders around the club so we have really missed that aspect
9134805 a few of the boys have said to me dont play too well down back or you will end up playing your whole career there but basically im happy to get a game
9134806 no more country club economics at the expense of working families and no more tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas
9134807 instead well invest in clean homegrown energy that will make us energy independent create jobs and combat global warming
9134808 new york city mayor mike bloomberg made news yesterday when he proposed perching windmills on top of the citys skyscrapers and bridges and building windfarms off the coasts of queens and brooklyn the move would make the city less dependent on the national energy grid he said and would also express the citys commitment to renewable energy

9134811 liberal activists are fighting to make sure it is center stage during the presidential campaign
9134812 would be at the head of the domestic agenda this election year
9134813 i dont think any democrat can have a successful campaign and not address health care
9134814 it is important that the next president and the next congress make health care reform a top and early priority
9134815 in spite of the enthusiasm of activists and the rhetoric of politicians the left wing remains deeply divided about health care reform
9134816 if obama is going to triumph he needs to attract the middle class voters whove watched their jobs health care retirement savings and family finances grow less secure
9134817 this will only happen if he sharpens and expands his economic message without further delay
9134818 to do that he must put three moves into his economic playbook so far mostly lacking
9134819 last year obama outlined a health plan light years better than mccains and then pretty much stopped talking about it

9134823 going into the season we all expected that side of the ball our defense to pay huge dividends for us said the woodlands head coach mark schmid who welcomed back 10 starters on the defensive side of the ball
9134824 they took the ball inside our 10 on their first possession schmid said
9134825 but then they turned it over but we couldnt do anything in the first half either
9134826 at halftime we told the kids we were playing good and our gameplan was going to work schmid said
9134827 we just needed to go out and play a little bit better and we did
9134828 witten can be a third receiver obviously hes a force as a pass receiver
9134829 theres no reason you cant give it a colts look where youve got witten in the slot like they do with dallas clark
9134830 i have a lot of fans and it feels great to know that people love me out there
9134831 thats what gets me pumped and thats what makes my game better is my fans
9134832 the thing i told the kids at halftime is were very young we graduated a bunch of kids
9134833 i said hey a bunch of you didnt have varsity experience in the first half youre now varsity football players
9134834 and our big deal was we didnt want to come back 10 points at a time we had to come back one good play at a time
9134835 they do what we do offensively and defensively very very similar and theyre very good
9134836 its all a growing experience and well learn for this and well get better
9134837 theres no scientific evidence for aids its probably all mass hysteria show some scientific evidence for aids

9134843 i wanted to run federally in scarborough the ndp was at 40 per cent but being a federal civil servant every time i sought election i had to take a leave of absence but the party wanted to hold the nomination months and months and months in advance so i had to decline so then i thought that made my mind up for me im running municipally and on the fifth try i won and ive won nine in a row since
9134844 we the candidates made deals and counter deals come to me after the second ballot or third ballot if youre out because we knew that with some many of us in the race you needed at least two votes or you would be out
9134845 i am ever thankful to john papadakis who changed from case ootes to me case had three votes and the rest of us had one

9134874 me parece una muy lamentable declaraci n del senador beltrones que yo rechazo categ ricamente
9134875 el prd ni es un partido violento en el senado ni somos partidarios de la violencia ni aceptamos coscorrones de nadie porque seamos violentos en el senado me parece que fue muy lamentable esa expresi n y espero que el senador beltrones la corrija pronto con su actitud

9134898 we chose ice hockey players because there is a lot of aggressive behaviour in the games and its usually an acceptable way of performing successfully we could also measure this aggression in terms of the number of penalty minutes
9134899 these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
9134900 in the end where it was more twisty i couldnt keep up the speed
9134901 in the glare of international attention it seems that even the government itself has acknowledged that this punishment was harsh and inappropriate
9134902 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms

9134922 un partido as de igualado depende de dos o tres puntos y el que los ganas se lleva el partido y l los ha jugado mejor que yo

9134931 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9134932 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9134933 i think about whether that person who i select would be most prepared to take my place and that would be the key criteria sic
9134934 the democrats will attempt to project the issue as whether a woman can be vice president a point the republicans can cheerfully concede returning to the question of whether this woman in particular should be the vice president mrs ferraro is manifestly an affirmative action nominee she has been in the house only since 1979 and cannot be said on the record to be as qualified to be president if necessary as say john glenn fritz hollings mo udall or george bush
9134935 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9134942 t he vision of mind that has captured the imagination of philosophers cognitive scientists economists and political scientists since the eighteenth century a dispassionate mind that makes decisions by weighing the evidence and reasoning to the most valid conclusions bears no relation to how the mind and brain actually work

9135197 i couldnt help it im so sorry he was beating me its all my fault
9135198 you cant actually plead guilty now anyway this proceeding is just to determine whether you stay in jail or get to go home and besides no matter how bad you feel right now im not clear that pleading guilty is the right decision especially if you were being beaten up
9135199 i already told the police i did it its all there on the videotape
9135200 im just saying youre fucked eddie already thinks you sneak cases
9135201 eddie knows i sneak cases lisa eddie respects me because i sneak cases eddie doesnt want pussies he wants people who yearn people who long to fight hell get over it
9135202 david feige f e i g e of the legal aid society appearing on behalf of ms sands
9135203 the defendant admitted stabbing the victim causing his death this being a homicide im required by my office to ask for remand
9135204 mr feige has raised some significant issues concerning the strength of this case and the claim of self defense would you like to respond
9135205 and i am required by my office to ask for remand
9135206 given the history of abuse mr feige has brought to my attention and the defendants ties to the community as well as the fact that this is her first arrest and that the entire case seems to rest on a confession that may itself make out a defense i am going to release ms sands on her own recognizance
9135207 so before you say anything please just hear me out i believe i can do this and id really like it if you gave me a chance
9135208 i spent all day yesterday at the crime scene i have photos got them developed last night

9135211 yes marvin it was in the basket i know i probably shouldnt have done it i understand
9135212 and youll work with eddie on it itll be his officially
9135213 yes eddie i swear marvin said i could do it as long as you worked on it with me
9135214 so gentle and funny strong and handsome i loved rodney so much and i killed him
9135215 it was getting worse and worse he kept hitting me harder longer i knew i should have just covered up and taken it
9135216 i should have let him do it i know i know
9135217 we were in the kitchen and the knife was there
9135218 and i just did it i grabbed the knife and i poked him and he was still hitting me and yelling and beating me and i just i just killed him i loved him and i killed him

9135369 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care about whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making five million dollars a year

9135382 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9135383 they believe that climate change will cause serious problems in australia and elsewhere in the world and they understand there will be sizeable cost going along with it
9135384 the lower income houses and seniors very strongly support labors plain to redistribute the income to those households while the middle to high income households clearly support reducing the gst
9135385 the public clearly favours spending 20 per cent of the money on r amp d even though we told them that if they did that they would redistribute less money to the public
9135386 that shows the australians are very forward looking they see it as a long term problem and the r amp d efforts will help them get over the hump

9135407 she is willing to take on the industry which provides 85 percent of her states revenue
9135408 i think its very scary to have someone with such a lack of knowledge and experience of budgets of legislative and parliamentary procedure of the economy and of business to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9135409 especially for someone who would be the oldest person to take the seat in history
9135410 she listens to her advisers but makes her own decisions she does not second guess herself
9135411 inappropriate but does not rise to the level of criminal activity
9135412 i almost wept shes going to be a hero for all our girls
9135413 im excited about it i think she will bring in votes mccain wouldnt have gotten

9135451 gov palin has executive experience as a mayor and governor and is a strong proponent of life and family
9135452 we dont have enough people in washington who understand the importance of local and state government
9135453 the upside for john mccain is it creates an opportunity for a historic ballot on either side
9135454 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9135455 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9135456 gov palin lacks the experience that sen mccain says a president needs
9135457 this pick had nothing to do with being qualified to step into the presidency it had everything to do with the dim political outlook for john mccains campaign

9135461 pernah kami keluar bersama rasulullah shallallahualaihi wasallam melayat jenazah salah satu laki laki dari kalangan anshar hingga kami sampai di pekuburan dan liang lahat belum digali
9135462 sesungguhnya seorang hamba yang beriman tatkala berpisah dari dunia dan menuju alam akhirat maka akan turun kepadanya para malaikat dari langit dengan wajah putih berseri seri seakan akan wajah mereka seperti matahari dan mereka membawa kafan di antara kafan kafan dari surga dan wewangian dari wewangian wewangian surga hingga mereka duduk sejauh mata memandang
9135463 wahai jiwa yang baik keluarlah menuju ampunan dan keridhaan allah
9135464 maka nyawanya keluar seperti keluarnya tetesan air dari bejana minum kemudian malaikat maut mengambil nyawa tersebut dan apabila dia telah memegangnya maka para malaikat itu sama sekali tidak pernah membiarkannya berlama lama di tangannya meskipun sekejap mata hingga mereka memegangnya kemudian mengkafaninya dan memberinya wewangian
9135465 tulislah kitab hamba ku di illiyyin dan kembalikan dia ke bumi sebab darinya aku menciptakan mereka dan kepadanya mereka akan aku kembalikan dan darinya mereka akan aku keluarkan untuk kedua kalinya
9135466 maka ruhnya dikembalkan ke jasadnya kemudian datanglah dua malaikat menemuinya
9135467 siapakah laki laki ini yang diutus ke tengah tengah kalian
9135468 aku membaca al quran kemudian aku beriman kepadanya dan aku membenarkannya
9135469 telah benar hamba ku maka hamparkanlah kepadanya hamparan dari surga dan berilah ia pakaian dari pakaian surga dan bukakanlah kepadanya pintu menuju surga
9135470 maka datanglah kepadanya bau wangi dan harumnya surga dan dilapangkan baginya dalam kubur sejauh mata memandang
9135471 berbahagialah dengan apa yang akan membahagiakanmu inilah hari yang dijanjikan kepadamu
9135472 siapa anda wajah anda adalah wajah orang yang datang membawa kebaikan
9135473 rabbi datangkanlah kiamat secepatnya hingga aku kembali bertemu dengan keluarga dan hartaku
9135474 sesungguhnya seorang hamba yang kafir tatkala hendak berpisah dari dunia dan menuju ke alam akhirat maka akan turun kepadanya para malaikat dari langit dengan wajah hitam pekam dan membawa kafan hingga mereka duduk sejauh mata memandang
9135475 wahai jiwa yang amat buruk keluarlah menuju kemarahan dan kemurkaan allah
9135476 maka nyawanya terpencar dalam jasadnya maka malaikat maut mencabuti nyawa tersebut seperti mencabuti besi yang digunakan untuk memanggang sate dari kain wool yang basah kemudian menangkapnya dan apabila dia telah memegangnya maka para malaikat itu tidak membiarkannya di tangannya meskipun sekejap mata lalu mereka meletakkanya di kain kafan tadi
9135477 tulislah kitabnya di dalam sijjin pada lapisan bumi yang paling bawah
9135478 dan barang siapa mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka adalah ia seolah olah jatuh dari langit lalu disambar oleh burung atau diterbangkan angin ke tempat yang jauh
9135479 siapakah laki laki ini yang telah diutus ke tengah tengah kalian
9135480 dusta dia maka hamparkanlah kepadanya hamparan dari neraka dan bukakanlah kepadanya pintu menuju neraka
9135481 siapa kamu wajah kamu adalah wajah orang yang datang membawa keburukan
9135482 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahualaihi wasallam mendatangi pekuburan seraya mengatakan semoga kesejahteraan untukmu wahai penduduk kampung barzakh dari orang orang mukmin dan muslim
9135483 kalian adalah para shahabatku dan saudara saudaraku yang akan datang setelahku
9135484 bagaimana engkau bisa mengenali orang orang yang datang setelah engkau wahai rasulullah
9135485 bagaimana pendapatmu kalau seandainya ada seorang laki laki yang memiliki kuda yang bersinar dahinya di antara kerumunan kuda hitam bukankah dia akan mengenalinya

9135487 kecuali nabi shalih alaihis salam telaga beliau alaihis salam adalah ambing susu untanya
9135488 aku belum mendapatkan dalil tentang hal ini aku sangat mengharapkan dari para pembaca sekalian apabila mendapatkan pembahasan seputar hal ini maka hendaknya menunjukkannya kepadaku sebab ilmu adalah rahmat di antara ahlinya
9135489 aku tidak mengetahui hal ini sedikitpun yakni tentang penisbatan bahwa telaga nabi shalih alaihis salam adalah ambing susu untanya
9135490 sungguh akan ada beberapa orang dari shahabatku yang akan mendatangiku di telagaku hingga tatkala aku melihat mereka dan diperlihatkan kepadaku mereka dihalangi dariku sehingga sungguh akan aku katakan
9135491 sesungguhnya kamu tidak tahu apa yang telah mereka ada adakan sepeninggalmu
9135492 periuk di telagaku besarnya antara ailah hingga shana di yaman di siana terdapat tempat air sebanyak jumlah bintang bintang di langit
9135493 dan di arashatil yaumul qiyamah terdapat telaga yang didatangi milik muhammad airnya lebih putih daripada susu dst
9135494 kesepuluh apakah nabi nabi yang lain juga memiliki telaga maka jawabnya adalah ya memiliki telaga sebab telah datang khabar dalam hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh imam at tirmidzi meskipun diperbincangkan keshahihannya

9135518 can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage
9135519 do you agree with sen harry reid democratic majority leader that the iraq war is lost
9135520 who cares how many words it takes joe biden tells it like it is and he knows what hes talking about after these eight years thats the change we need
9135521 that phrase dont tell them more than you know is some of the best advice i have ever received i put it into practice constantly
9135522 what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9135523 you still have this group of women out there who are uncertain for the democrats
9135524 this is a large attempt to go after that vote
9135525 my guess is hes trying to appeal to women and younger people
9135526 the assumption is given his age and medical history he has to get someone who is a plausible occupant for the oval office palin will have a tough time making that case
9135527 john mccain and sarah palin offer proven leadership as opposed to the democrats who only talk about change but the issues that they talk about are out of the 60s and 70s
9135528 i think it had some traction with some voters it was certainly something that gave people pause
9135529 she even comes with a ready made investigation of her office
9135530 maybe if you were governor of california or new york that would be true
9135531 all anyone has been talking about but no one here knows who she is
9135532 this is going to bring so many hillary clinton voters to the republicans
9135533 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
9135534 in spite of my beliefs for one reason to maintain my political viability within the system for years i have worked to prepare myself for a political life characterized by both practical political ability and concern for rapid social progress

9135545 by conducting a prayer vigil and writing to ban we seek to highlight the issue in the international arena if india seeks to become a major player in the global arena since it is a signatory to the human rights declaration it should respect these sensibilities
9135546 un is not a foreign body and india is very much part of it whether mr ban reads the letter or makes a statement on it not it is not going to resurrect the dead christians india needs to own up to its responsibility in protecting its own citizens
9135547 by giving the memorandum to mr ban we would like to call the attention of the world body to the plight of christians in india because india is constitutionally a secular state we would like to see all communities irrespective of their religions to live in peace and harmony india should uphold its constitutions and so this memorandum
9135548 we are concerned about the atrocities committed on the minorities in our mother land we condemn every murder including that of swami saraswati whose murder was perpetrated by communist maoists the vishwa hindu parishad blamed the christians for the killing using it as a ruse to attack and kill christians who also are peaceful citizens of india
9135549 what we are witnessing here is a complete failure of the government machinery headed by the biju janata dal bharatiya janata party combine in protecting the innocent citizens of the state where extremists are wreaking havoc by killing people and challenging the pluralistic character of the nation
9135550 then after the murder the government should have been proactive in preventing riots and protecting christians the vhp is also to be blamed for the negative propaganda about the myth of conversion and central government for its failure to intervene in a timely manner
9135551 being a forever peace loving and religious tolerant community christians are remaining mute spectators to these intensely inhuman and barbaric acts

9135562 what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9135563 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9135564 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9135565 i presume testing will be difficult for us to do so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9135566 hopefully we will find a way on it i think it will be possible for us to surmount some of these obstacles
9135567 nsg does not have a ban on enrichment and reprocessing technology transfer per se unlike the us none of the countries have ban in their countries on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology
9135568 we dont want some countries individual predilections to be performing part of huge package of items in the nsg
9135569 it is uncalled for we have put all the cards on the table we have been as transparent as anyone else we are willing to make our case before the nsg we do not understand the need for the review mechanism
9135570 if we have periodic reviews they investors will say it should not be done
9135571 our concerns are well known i think most of the countries recognised the validity of our concerns there are some countries who i think are ideologically committed to their concepts of non proliferation and hence tend to take a sort of hardline position on this
9135572 i think it is a question of convincing them that india with an impeccable record in terms of non proliferation and the fact that it has always stood for universal nuclear disarmament is a right candidate for nuclear commerce
9135573 as long as it does not inhibit us from what we believe is clean and unconditional waiver
9135574 i am optimistic but i will not allow optimism to override caution
9135575 the work is in progress and i cannot tell you the details
9135576 yes constant dialogue is going on between new delhi and the us
9135577 i believe if anybody is friendly to us they will benefit
9135578 we were prepared for this because as we were told as it may be necessary to have two rounds before finalising something which would be mutually satisfactory
9135579 for years the waste has been accumulating nothing has been done to clean it up and the consequences are lethal

9135589 i got a telephone call in 1988 from a jogger claiming to have witnessed a startling phenomenon
9135590 he said do you guys know there is a green sea turtle in the san gabriel river
9135591 i asked him if the turtle had claws on its feet
9135592 if the answer is yes which it almost always is its a freshwater turtle it saves me a trip
9135593 we used to think the san diego bay group was the northernmost foraging colony of green sea turtles

9135601 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with but with employment levels near record highs interest rates that are historically low and the past decade of rising incomes and job creation the uk is well placed to deal with this
9135602 the imf has down rated every countrys growth forecast in the light of whats been happening in the world economy however they have lowered their expectations in relation to us by less than other countries
9135603 i do remain optimistic that provided we can take action not just in this country but with other countries provided we can take the right action then we can ensure that the economy stays growing as it has done for the last few years

9135685 we are excited to have ca compuware and progressive medical inc as sponsors for this event
9135686 the support we are receiving from these sponsors demonstrates the value this event brings to the it community in central ohio
9135687 making inc s list under any circumstances is an achievement but accomplishing this in the retail industry which only had 11 of the total ranked companies is truly notable especially in a flat specialty market like hockey
9135688 recognition by inc magazine is a strong compliment for an accomplished staff with a vital growth plan
9135689 the inc 5000 gives an unrivaled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
9135690 among the etfs covered by powershares momentum tracker powershares dynamic financials pfi has led the pack showing remarkable resilience in a difficult environment
9135691 these criteria are fairly standard fare for a broad index
9135692 but factors such as weighting market cap and style allocations have helped pfi to weather the financial storm
9135693 this allocation has undoubtedly lessened the blow from the largest financials in recent months
9135694 cushioning pfi from the brunt of the market downturn while other large cap value financial etfs such as ishares dow finance iyf have sustained greater losses
9135695 as uncertainty within the financial sector continues to rise pfis relative performance may not assuage investors who believe that the worst is yet to come
9135696 our power of three initiative is moving forward in all respects and we have placed a special emphasis on the training aspects of the program
9135697 with hands on centers in marblehead massachusetts and six other locations around the country plus a keen eye on the economic times for our dealers we now offer conveniently located training opportunities throughout the u s saving them travel time and money
9135698 this new center brings the best training in the industry even closer to home for the entire northeast corridor
9135699 dealers from philadelphia to montreal will now be able to travel a much shorter distance to get the same high standard of hands on training offered at our corporate training center in lexington
9135700 we were concerned about the rising rates of unauthorised absence in our school and devised a plan to help combat this truancy call performs an integral role in this process as it allows us to contact parents of missing pupils instantly in the first six months of using the system we even had a call from the scottish executive questioning our annual report due to the remarkable decrease in absentees
9135701 the system has helped open communication with our parents many of them lead extremely busy lives and in the past would not always contact us if their child was out of school for authorised reasons now we have truancy call in place which consistently contacts them should their child be absent for any reason they tend to call and let us know which saves a lot of administration time
9135702 truancy call works extremely well in our school and communication between staff is a vital part of that parents trust that when a message is sent out alerting them to their childs absence that this is correct and not a case of a late arrival or unrecorded dentist appointment
9135703 we decided to use this service as a way to deter students from returning late back to class they now have to sign in with a classroom assistant and give a reason for their lateness or a message is sent out to their parents this has helped combat the problem of students turning up at registration and disappearing half way through the day with a full attendance record
9135704 with the amount of crime and violence that young people are experiencing nowadays schools need to take more responsibility for knowing the whereabouts of their students using truancy call has dramatically reduced the levels of absenteeism in our school and gives parents the peace of mind that if theyre not contacted their child is safely in school the system does however have to form part of an overall strategy which has the buy in of both staff and parents to work optimally

9135718 i find that handheld voting technology brings an indispensable wow factor to the classroom i use qwizdom to assess what pupils have learned at the end of social studies topics and it marks the answers for me which is such a timesaver this means i can spend more one to one time with pupils to address particular aspects of topics they find difficult i have even started to get the kids to devise their own questions and this is revolutionising the way we carry out assessment
9135719 actionpoint suite provides teachers with a comprehensive way to assess their pupils knowledge and have fun whilst they do it the software not only reduces the time they have to spend marking tests but allows them to manipulate the data to focus on different pupils and demographics

9135751 based upon our polling in key battleground states in 2007 and early 2008 all indicators pointed to john mccain as the only plausible republican presidential nominee
9135752 our polling showed that mccain was the second choice of the other candidates supporters particularly in florida which really made mccains nomination possible our polling in 2008 have shown that barack obama underperforms among female voters particularly in the states of ohio michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin that provides an opening for senator mccain

9135756 the summer internship program my law firm offers is the perfect way for students hoping to attend law school to get real life experience with tax law
9135757 by coming to work at my firm the interns are able to gain prospective on tax law as well as an opportunity to rub shoulders with and ask questions of attorneys who work in tax law
9135758 the interns learned how to perform all the same duties as the full time assistants
9135759 they process incoming documentation sent to us by our clients and help to prepare the clients files for negotiations with the irs they also review and process irs mail as needed the interns have also been instrumental in helping the law firm keep pace on work relating to creating the electronic client files
9135760 in school youre always so focused on how a teacher or a judge sees things that it is easy to disregard the perspective of the client and other third parties
9135761 working at this firm gives the interns the unique opportunity to see hear and experience how the legal process unfolds from the client representatives perspective as well as the clients perspective it is important to be able to understand or at least empathize with all sides of the issue both in law school and as an attorney
9135762 i learned a lot about the field of tax law and gained hands on experience with real life tax law
9135763 it has been rewarding to play a part in helping people resolve their tax liabilities plus i really enjoyed working in the law firms laid back yet productive environment
9135764 our practice is very deadline driven and the interns have worked hard this summer
9135765 they have taken some of the pressure off the law firms full time employees i believe this has allowed us to focus a little more time on providing our clients with the outstanding service they deserve
9135766 i am looking forward to offering this program in the summers to follow it gives prospective attorneys a worthwhile experience and guidance while giving my law firm and our clients dedicated and interested workers i cannot think of a better trade off
9135767 working at a private law firm before law school makes sense
9135768 it gives interns a chance to get their feet wet experiencing the work environment first hand it also provides them some perspective of what it is like in the real world before taking the law school plunge

9135780 as we looked for expansion opportunities weve focused our efforts on areas of the country that are committed and dedicated to dogs
9135781 charlotte is one of those areas and were certain that frozen woofys will be a huge success here
9135782 when i first heard about frozen woofys i was very excited that there was finally a healthy alternative to whats currently available in the grocery stores
9135783 now small pet stores can carry a frozen product for dogs and feel confident that it is good for their canine customers
9135784 we believe our popularity is directly related to an overwhelming desire to make sure that the food we give our dogs is healthy nutritious and safe
9135785 were so pleased at pampered pets inn to provide a healthy and organic product to our customers and even happier that this is not something you can find just anywhere
9135786 this is the type of product our customers have come to expect from us and frozen woofys is receiving an overwhelmingly positive response
9135787 like most dog owners we want to make sure our dogs are getting the best and healthiest products available
9135788 now not only are we sure of that we can now provide our product to other locations on the east coast
9135789 lmds mission is people dedicated to the spirit of dogs this will be our guiding principle going forward
9135790 and were thrilled to be developing and launching a product in this region that will not only make our dogs happy but make our dog owners happy as well

9135800 we believe that this sizable investment in hardware software technology and processes clearly demonstrates a strong commitment to the marketplace to provide the most robust online backup and recovery solution possible furthermore since the amount of data organizations create and need to maintain is growing exponentially each year a solution that is dependable easy to use and implement and competitively priced will be very favorably received

9135835 while i am overwhelmed with the loss of my husband and the children their father it does bring comfort to know that so many people care and are giving and thoughtful
9135836 between the donations and eriks benefits at least i dont have to worry about money right now
9135837 i want to get around to writing thank you notes but my main focus right now is on getting through the day and caring for myself and my children
9135838 john mccain and sarah palin offer proven leadership as opposed to the democrats who only talk about change but the issues that they talk about are out of the 60s and 70s
9135839 i think it had some traction with some voters it was certainly something that gave people pause
9135840 she even comes with a ready made investigation of her office
9135841 maybe if you were governor of california or new york that would be true
9135842 all anyone has been talking about but no one here knows who she is
9135843 this is going to bring so many hillary clinton voters to the republicans
9135844 where it goes will determine whether it knocks down trees and floods bayous or whether it destroys communities
9135845 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9135846 saya memiliki keunggulan yang besar tetapi masih terlalu awal untuk membuat keputusan seperti itu membalap hanya untuk urutan kedua
9135847 pertama adalah karena finis di posisi kedua adalah ketidakberuntungan dan kedua masih ada enam seri lagi dan bukannya dua kami akan berusaha tampil seperti di balapan terakhir dan mencoba mengalahkan casey
9135848 its a republican convention yet the republican brand is not that good
9135849 i think its kind of more that they know who they are
9135850 turn the page quickly from bush and cheney on day one and get to the mccain story
9135851 a mix of punching each other in the groin and trying to be inspirational all at the same time
9135852 it appears its at least got him in the ballgame
9135853 comes second thats one advantage you get to contrast yourself with the other party
9135854 either this is going to build interest in the second convention or lose it
9135855 or they call and say theyre going to lose their house at the end of the month and have to get rid of their tortoise
9135856 it forces people to downsize to condos with no backyards from houses with big backyards
9135857 they dont need to be coddled every day and theyll come to you if you call
9135858 the wildlife doesnt need another sick animal in the desert
9135859 we tried everything but we have to think of our clients and the attorneys ethical obligations
9135860 the reason weve received for not being allowed to fill positions is that we have some budget problems
9135861 but in tough economic times the crime rate doesnt go down it goes up
9135862 fortunately these are misdemeanor cases and theyre easier to handle than felonies
9135863 still the implications are often the same as felonies a criminal record jail time fines they have to be addressed with the same seriousness as felony representation
9135864 you must have one of the special order iphones with the matte screen just like apples laptops

9135885 it was good a nice track and a great crowd said bolt
9135886 my start was not too good i concentrated on winning and as i am starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster a time my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9135887 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next theres still one race to go for the jackpot
9135888 it was no revenge for me because i beat myself in beijing i wasnt beaten by the other girls in a clean race said jones
9135889 if an 11 year old girl can do it so can i
9135890 i was fortunate to get those few waves out at the beginning that allowed me to get a few manoeuvres in gilmore said
9135891 it was really tough out there really fast and racy and not easy to get scores
9135892 unfortunately for layne she wasnt able to find a wave she could really open up on
9135893 its my second year on tour and im looking to defend my title
9135894 im just happy that i can still hang with the young girls and to finish in the final and move up to third is a great place to be heading into the back half of the season the 36 year old said
9135895 im really proud of steph shes been the form surfer all event and she deserved the win
9135896 then the jacket came off and i noted some impeccable pec definition and had to wonder if there was anything lovelier than a fine looking fun loving texas man on a warm spring afternoon and the answer had to be
9135897 as her layers of self absorption are blasted away by a series of slapstick events the woman blythe can be begins to emerge birds novel is fast and funny and the final plot twist which casts blythe as a rescuer instead of the needing to be rescued is satisfying
9135898 like some traveling circus that was always showing up in town full of magic tricks and cotton candy and games that were hard to win
9135899 we went to iraq to make a statement about what happens if you defy and attack the united states of america
9135900 to protect our ally israel to protect the oil fields in the area to make certain that saddam hussein did not have nuclear weapons and to destroy all weapons of any kind that he did have before he used them to supply al qaeda and because the american public i myself included wanted revenge
9135901 but i could feel my heart breaking seriously it actually physically broke and the love for denny that id been holding on to for two whole years more than seven hundred days it just leaked right out
9135902 really i could feel it invisible and burning running out from my ears and eyes and nose
9135903 and suddenly there were upon the wall words white on a black background the words folly of vanity and then here were people beautiful people and words between them and a story of a young woman just married and the way she spent money and spent it the story rolled and pitched and words came on the wall and people around him laughed a sound hed not heard before people gathered in a large room and laughing together
9135904 the womans gone off on an evil bender must be because shes afraid of her gender
9135905 its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment davenport said
9135906 there was no decision made before the tournament and i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9135907 i never felt like i had my feet underneath me davenport said
9135908 i was never in the match the way i wanted to be it was some of my least great tennis i was able to stay in there and try to turn it around
9135909 i was so pissed off that i didnt think about anything davenport said
9135910 they stood in silence staring at the money it was funny she thought in the movies it would have been ten million some ridiculous sum three hundred and seventy thousand dollars was a lot no doubt but it wasnt completely outside the realm of their experience
9135911 thats the problem with you people im not saying i wouldnt have taken it i would did as a matter of fact but i didnt tell myself it wasnt hurting anybody i wanted it so i took it you get my meaning
9135912 i thought about the guy who once called himself my father the death of quiet inside an apartment a footfall on the doorstep and voices down a hallway a quiet dangerous sort of rumble something you developed an instinct for ten years old and creeping through the kitchen as the voices got closer out the back door and into the fading sunlight
9135913 die n chsten zw lf monate werden die schwersten zw lf monate f r die labour party seit einer generation
9135914 wir m ssen den schwung wiederfinden mit dem wir drei wahlen gewonnen haben und das ist f r uns derzeit ein riesiges problem die menschen sind stinksauer auf uns
9135915 hay instrucciones que declaran el cierre inmediato de empresas solicitamos la modificaci n del texto
9135916 vamos a tener una consulta bien efectiva con los factores involucrados en el problema para que el martes y mi rcoles tengamos todos los cambios de la ley consensuado con el menpet propiciaremos el debate de la segunda discusi n
9135917 el gobierno est abusando de la estructura del estado para promover al psuv
9135918 los or genes del chavismo eran la lucha contra la corrupci n la lucha contra las organizaciones de poder contra el equilibrio de poder la lucha por la democracia
9135919 cease all unauthorised commercial activity immediately remove all materials and remove all trucks helicopters plant and machinery from site
9135920 everybody is happy to see life in the factory again but residents had viable concerns that needed to be met and are satisfied that the council is doing its utmost to ensure that the companies involved comply with planning policy
9135921 the companies practices arent in line with current planning permission at the factory
9135922 both the residents and i dont want to see closures but the companies need to go through the planning process and do everything above board
9135923 now they have a month to regularise their activities or else they will need to apply for planning permission to carry out their practices they could indeed centrally apply for planning through the management company
9135924 due to the companys heavy machinery using local roads and the lucrative business they are in i feel that one million euro is a reasonable contribution to make
9135925 i would like to see something similar if the company apply for planning permission at the burlington factory in order to safeguard local residents
9135926 i dont think a hillary person would ever move to her based on the issues
9135927 i dont think before today i would have ever heard someone call her a feminist
9135928 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9135929 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9135930 were trying to do something new and solicit some supporters and get more people involved
9135931 were looking for people to talk to people they already know about the levy were not asking volunteers to talk to strangers
9135932 we had a surprising number of people come to us after the last election that didnt know about the levy and wanted to help
9135933 and a levy is the only legal way we have to raise more money
9135934 its a huge resource thats used statewide but not here
9135935 asking for just the funding for services for children is a compromise were making with the community because we know people have a limited amount of support they can give
9135936 unfortunately we wont be able to do as many of the innovative things we had planned
9135937 this feels great right now it hasnt even sunk in
9135938 i was just trying to stay in the match with hamilton the same thing in the match against with pat
9135939 you cant start second guessing yourself that was the one only mental error i made and it cost me the match
9135940 i wanted to turn over a 4 iron but i turned it over way too much
9135941 it was a good number for me and i knew i had to execute the shot but i just didnt do it you cannot miss left
9135942 i didnt play as well in the finals as i did throughout the week but i just kept hanging in there
9135943 ward really played great but i thought if you start playing well maybe hell give me an opening or two you never know whats going to happen but the breaks went my way in the end
9135944 i gave myself plenty of opportunities i just couldnt seal the deal
9135945 you have to hand it to charlie though he scrambled his brains out all the credit goes to him he really hung tough
9135946 i putted great for three days this is the first one of these ive ever won
9135947 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9135948 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9135949 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9135950 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9135951 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9135952 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9135953 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9135954 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9135955 le magasin de samantha est en train de couler on essaie de faire ne sorte quil se relance donc oui nous sommes r unies dans cette preuve mais nous ne sommes pas ensemble

9135957 le prime de vendredi dernier a t tr s charg en motions cela a t tr s difficile
9135958 oh wow thats great lets see what we can do but first come here
9135959 do you want to wear them theyre yours see their orange like your birthstone
9135960 my hopes of losing you are now overpowered by the hopes of finding myself
9135961 being self employed you carry risks that may not apply to big accountancy offices
9135962 we have to scrap for business it is one thing doing the work but something else when it comes to getting paid particularly in what is a different economic climate compared to previous years
9135963 despite the economic slowdown and evidence of an increase in unemployment across the economy our members remain largely positive regarding their own prospects
9135964 remuneration levels are seen as very satisfactory with high levels of job satisfaction and job security also evident in the findings
9135965 the coming 12 months will be very challenging for many of our members who occupy financial decision making roles in both the public and private sectors
9135966 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
9135967 colocamos una c mara en un lugar por donde pasan normalmente los ping inos camino del mar o de regreso y cada imagen que procesa la c mara se env a a un ordenador
9135968 kanshi ram siempre dijo que estar a muy contento de instalar mi estatua junto a la suya as que he decidido erigirla para cumplir con sus deseos
9135969 vio que su estatua era m s peque a que la de kanshi ram y orden cambiarla es la primera vez que una persona viva y en el poder usa dinero del gobierno para construir una estatua propia esto no es apropiado ni tico ni l cito
9135970 la vibraci n y la radiaci n del sonido caracter sticas de un viol n est n determinadas por la geometr a del instrumento y por las propiedades materiales de la madera
9135971 we were a little out of sync but we battled hard and came away with the win
9135972 they fought hard in front of 2 000 pilot fans after falling behind late in the match 2 1 our young players earned their stripes tonight while the older players led by scott dillie and brendan dunn showed great poise under pressure
9135973 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making
9135974 it would have been nice to have got past him and played roger federer in the third round but it wasnt to be
9135975 as opposed to twelve months ago i feel like im a much better player with my results and hopefully i can keep going in the right direction
9135976 its all a step forward i won one match here which was good but i was disappointed to lose today
9135977 it was quite a tight match and i had a few small opportunities in the first couple of sets but couldnt quite take them
9135978 he played too good in the fourth set it was close he won the crucial points and played too good at certain stages
9135979 the rain made it tough but it was the same for both of us
9135980 we the undersigned fairfax columnists believe the sacking of mike carlton is an unjustified and provocative act by fairfax management
9135981 it has long been accepted practice that when staff journalists are on strike columnists should also remove their labour
9135982 mike carlton did no more than would have been done by any of the undersigned had our deadline coincided with industrial action we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
9135983 mike carlton is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
9135984 over here you hear them talking about share price and restructuring but rarely about journalism
9135985 we are absolutely not disappointed at that price i think the record of people paying big prices for internet assets isnt really a great record
9135986 i am amazed that fairfax didnt do whatever it took to own control the largest employment recruitment website
9135987 i believe the only way for a company such as theirs which is heavily reliant and dependent on classifieds to insulate against the migration online is to ensure they are the dominant player online
9135988 i found no media model for a broadsheet classified dependent newspaper organisation that would pull me out of the hole i found myself in at fairfax
9135989 in hindsight i should have seen that classifieds tend to gravitate to the leading site in any category i should have done something other than try to compete head to head
9135990 we make no bones about the fact we do continue to see a leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising and that will no doubt continue
9135991 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not part of the business that is being affected at all
9135992 its really mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
9135993 resolver el problema pol tico que hay en este pa s
9135994 sigue habiendo desgraciadamente un problema pol tico de fondo en este pa s
9135995 esta tormenta tiene el potencial de ser muy peligrosa por eso exhortamos a los residentes a seguir las instrucciones de los funcionarios de los cuerpos de emergencia y a que est n preparados para evacuar la zona
9135996 we have no experience with this kind of a storm and after katrina there is no way we are staying
9135997 it does look like this will be a strong storm
9135998 from one hockey mom to another shes in good standing with me
9135999 we are all just astounded i didnt think you could keep a secret in washington but i guess you can
9136000 if people are looking for change this is a very exciting change
9136001 the fact that the womens vote is up for grabs did make a strong woman a plus on the ticket
9136002 he also wants to balance his ticket with youth and energy and give the republican party a future candidate
9136003 azadi its the only thing the kashmiri wants denial is delusion
9136004 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
9136005 these are the ones who will be turning out the airports lights theyll be the last ones out
9136006 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9136007 millions of texans still plan to travel over the holiday but high gas prices and a slower economy means more of them are taking trips closer to home
9136008 nothing in this world that i owned had more sentimental value to me
9136009 that gun meant the world to me it means the world to me i was in tears when i read that article
9136010 he got to see a lot of the horrors of that time
9136011 his men took that windshield out and made those grips for his weapon
9136012 every day i pick him up hes learning more phrases
9136013 immersion is how you learned your first language your whole world opens up with a second language
9136014 play is the vehicle of how children learn it has to be fun
9136015 they need to be safe to experiment with the language children need to make mistakes
9136016 theres certainly a need for it in the environment we live in especially in texas
9136017 at this age they learn it extremely quickly they suck up everything
9136018 however it would appear important in the trial of the case whether or not any of the four individuals named by the witness had been at the property where the murders occurred
9136019 the interests of justice are simply too great to ignore the prospect that the evidence may contain the dna of one of these four named individuals
9136020 did you really think that you could get away with all the lying not only did you hurt me with all your lying but you hurt so many other people
9136021 an accusation of moral failure has been leveled against me this accusation is false
9136022 i loved you and i thought you did me but i guess not because all you cared to do was cover your butt
9136023 if you had just come clean from the beginning i wouldnt have been called all the horrible names that i was but its ok because i am strong and i could handle it because i knew god was on my side
9136024 i wanted to go out there and get better with this game
9136025 i wanted to go out there and really take advantage of this take advantage of those reps out there im one play away from starting ill go look at the film and get better from this

9136028 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9136029 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9136030 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9136031 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9136032 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9136033 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9136034 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9136035 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9136036 we have not had any communication with roski his group the nfl or anyone regarding l a
9136037 pssst wanna take alex off our hands remember not only is he from san diego but he played well for you when you were my offensive coordinator a few years back
9136038 and the really good ones are a point better than they are bad alex needs to learn that
9136039 dit was een van de slechtste wedstrijden uit mijn carri re

9136149 the development testing qa production environments arent the same the sysadmins are looking at it they should be done
9136150 i really like the way our defense played in the second half
9136151 they broke up passes and took the run away bonanza just couldnt get much going because we kept clogging those lanes and breaking through
9136152 i dropped back and saw bonanza was blitzing so i rolled to my right
9136153 i was just going to try to run it as far as i could but i saw skyler get open and i just dumped it at the last second he slid in and grabbed it
9136154 i think we played well even though we still have room for improvement and i felt great while i was out there
9136155 i thought our defense was phenomenal but our offense made too many costly errors
9136156 our offensive line was opening holes but our running backs werent finding them
9136157 its a signature of our defense to hit hard and fast
9136158 we self destructed half of their points because of our miscues
9136159 i was jittery in the beginning but i picked it up in the third quarter and had fun
9136160 coach told us we needed to score and that helped spark us
9136161 we made a lot of mistakes we were too tired and we need to pick up the intensity

9136166 on the third anniversary of katrina we can look back on a city and region whose citizens have bravely cleaned up and rebuilt today is a day to celebrate their resilience and pledge to help them finish the job it is also a day to remember the disastrously inadequate response from the federal government and pledge that never again will we let bureaucratic incompetence leave disaster victims stranded and alone

9136220 we denken sneller dat een kind een stoornis heeft omdat we de lat almaar hoger leggen
9136221 een steeds grotere groep haalt daardoor de norm niet meer maar dat wil niet zeggen dat ze allemaal een stoornis hebben
9136222 is iedereen ervan overtuigd dat we naar een dialoog van gemeenschappen moeten is iedereen ervan overtuigd dat het om een grote staatshervorming moet gaan en hoe gaan we onderhandelen met wie en met welk mandaat
9136223 voor mij is er maar n antwoord het is de vlaamse regering die moet onderhandelen de mensen aan de andere kant van de tafel moeten eenzelfde soort mandaat hebben als de mandaten niet gelijk zijn krijg je een praatbarak die geen beslissingen kan nemen ook de vragen naar wat we gaan bespreken en naar de timing zijn belangrijk maar voor mij moet er eerst en vooral een duidelijk antwoord komen op de hoe vraag
9136224 de staatshervorming realiseren vanuit de deelstaten is een zeer belangrijke uitdaging we beleven momenteel een momentum dat we niet mogen verprutsen iedereen moet de ernst van de situatie inzien want als deze dialoog mislukt wordt het echt penibel
9136225 dat was ook jaren aanmodderen omdat vlaanderen iets vroeg en de nederlanders daar geen enkel belang bij hadden dat hebben we pas kunnen oplossen door een langetermijnperspectief in de onderhandelingen te brengen wat is de visie op het schelde estuarium op termijn daar hebben de nederlanders wel belang bij er ontstond een vertrouwensband en het is gelukt

9136241 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9136242 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9136243 a complaint against dnr for a recently launched state website meant to clarify the issue for voters
9136244 are about to make history after eight years of george bush
9136245 i thought there would be a big crowd down here watching
9136246 i expected it would be standing room only i was thinking i wouldnt even be able to find a place to eat
9136247 i got the feeling those people would have thrown stones at me if i asked them to change the channel
9136248 religion is to the 21st century what ideology was to the 20th
9136249 tolerance is not enough because theres no educational component to it
9136250 tolerance doesnt bust down stereotype tolerance doesnt put a face on faith
9136251 but the original survey provided a baseline for a second more intriguing one five years later
9136252 this time around the institute reported that the number of houses of worship participating in inter religious worship had tripled to more than 22 while the number that joined in community service had risen more than fourfold to 38
9136253 people are not beyond redemption people can learn people can cooperate
9136254 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
9136255 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
9136256 i think those two opinions written by justice george really soured people on the court issue
9136257 even though intellectually we all understand that the funding of the courts really has nothing to do with justice georges writing of a particular legal opinion
9136258 i find it ironic that the same people who say the courts should not legislate from the bench attempted to hold the judicial system hostage through the legislative process
9136259 we talk a lot about campaign finance reform and try to come up with a system that is fair
9136260 this is a very modest proposal to try a different way
9136261 they dont think its fair that you are going to put a tax on them because they have nothing to do with the secretary of state
9136262 most people dont realize how much care they need may come outside of a hospital
9136263 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
9136264 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
9136265 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

9136321 sarah how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment upside down
9136322 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9136323 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9136324 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9136325 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9136326 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9136327 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9136328 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9136329 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9136330 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9136331 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9136332 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9136333 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9136334 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9136335 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9136336 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9136337 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9136338 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9136339 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9136340 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9136341 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9136342 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9136343 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9136344 as there was between my father and your father see i am sending you a gift of silver and gold now break your treaty with baasha king of israel so he will withdraw from me
9136345 i lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people israel but you walked in the ways of jeroboam and caused my people israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins 3 so i am about to consume baasha and his house and i will make your house like that of jeroboam son of nebat 4 dogs will eat those belonging to baasha who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country
9136346 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9136347 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9136348 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9136349 the pressure to come up with something is going to be intense
9136350 all of a sudden this thing has assumed much more importance than it had a week ago
9136351 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9136352 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9136353 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9136354 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9136355 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9136356 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9136357 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9136358 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9136359 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9136360 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9136361 no s cu l es cu l ser qu tercero son en serio qu no tuve ese tercero ya
9136362 memories are so powerful that affect every detail in future whatever is happy sad funny boring they are indeed meaningful and not being forgotten
9136363 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9136364 were hopeful that the contractors will come to the table with a new commitment for workers rights and improved quality services
9136365 well continue to have some of these issues that crop up from time to time and the only thing we can do is be prepared for knowing well occasionally encounter errors and fix them quickly
9136366 im just waiting for the first week of school and for the phone to ring
9136367 a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that ucla is cheating on admissions
9136368 hes taking an outcome and from that deducing a cause
9136369 they caved under the pressure from the naacp and others in los angeles who want to see an increase in the number of black students
9136370 there are so many ways you can rig the system
9136371 it is obvious that the admissions staff was under intense pressure to admit more african americans
9136372 because i cannot properly conduct the duties with which i am charged as a member of cuars i am therefore resigning in protest from the committee
9136373 to do otherwise would condone and make me complicit in what appears to be illegal activity
9136374 we got leads the public was calling in leads and we followed up on each and every one of those
9136375 it looked very good and promising but there were literally probably more than a double digit number of suspects we brought in
9136376 if you go look for a blue civic youre going to find a lot of them
9136377 this is great news and the detectives did an excellent job
9136378 but the real credit must go to the actual victim because she gave an excellent description of not only the suspect but the suspects vehicle which was critical
9136379 when something like this happens it really strikes at the whole community and were happy to have this individual behind bars
9136380 what hes facing is a life sentence short of murder this is it this is the top of the food chain for crimes
9136381 i came when id heard youd beaten the elite four
9136382 no theyre not theyre dying frittering away their fast extinguishing lives doing things which are at best meaningless and at worst harmful
9136383 but their character does not match their giftedness and they get exposed because of their character
9136384 the investigation certainly appears to corroborate that version of events
9136385 dramatic action to restore confidence in the stability of the tax system
9136386 to restore our competitiveness and help prevent any more companies from deciding to leave the uk
9136387 the uk is one of the largest recipients of inward investment in the world and hosts more international headquarters than any country outside the usa
9136388 even with the tories we wont see a reduction in business taxes both political parties need to be more ambitious
9136389 the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the uk tax treatment of international groups
9136390 ireland does not encourage the establishment of so called brass plate operations which seek to simply avail of our corporate tax regime we want to see real substance in investment in ireland
9136391 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9136392 uh bitch your presidential candidates foreign policy experience sign in before you can post messages

9136506 i had seen sottsass projects in which he had used our chair ettore was the first designer who took our chairs out of their typical environments navy ships prisons hospitals and to use them in contemporary interior design projects through him sir terence conran frank gehry and philippe starck discovered the emeco chair creating resurgence in the 1990s
9136507 a chair must be really important as an object because my mother always told me to offer my chair to a lady
9136508 ettore always had orange cushions fixed onto his navy chairs at home in milan and our idea started there we wanted to make the new chair soft friendly and of course colorful

9136527 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9136528 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9136529 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9136530 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9136531 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9136532 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9136533 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9136534 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

9136543 sar un presidente ha concluso che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9136544 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9136545 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9136546 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9136547 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9136548 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9136549 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9136550 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9136551 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9136552 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9136553 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9136554 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9136555 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9136556 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9136557 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9136558 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9136559 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9136560 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9136561 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9136562 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9136563 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9136564 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9136565 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9136566 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9136567 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9136568 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9136569 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9136570 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9136571 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9136572 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9136573 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9136574 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9136575 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9136576 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9136577 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9136578 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9136579 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9136580 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9136581 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9136582 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9136583 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma

9136610 yes probably until they move into their new stadium that is publicly financed and then this question gets a hell of a lot more interesting
9136611 the officers observed a male standing on his seat cursing using inappropriate language and acting in a disorderly manner while reeking of alcohol and decided to eject him rather than subject others to his offensive behavior
9136612 i confessed to him that i may have listened to the preview cd a few more times than was strictly necessary to prepare for our interview but its hardly like confessing to a secret fondness for the sound stylings of barney the dinosaur the goal of roll play is to get children exercising in fun and imaginative ways but the music makes it easy enough for adults like me to shrug off the fact that the lyrics are about centipede sisters or tasmanian devils having temper tantrums

9136626 unfortunately showing that the bennett group lied is not enough to turn back the clock and return the sonics as a result i am withdrawing the lawsuit
9136627 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9136628 we are pleased to now be able to move on
9136629 we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9136630 at the very least its unusual and his reasons are questionable
9136631 we havent had a chance to talk to his attorney or any folks to find out what theyre thinking
9136632 given the recent city settlement we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9136633 thus the prevailing wisdom is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9136634 in the beginning everybody was talking about him trying to fix his image and doing this for pr reasons
9136635 but the fact that they kept very quiet and they didnt go out and hire a pr firm to pat themselves on the back for doing this i was leaning toward thinking he was doing it for the right reasons
9136636 theres a lot of people in our group that werent off the starbucks boycott they were at least open minded to the possibility of getting off it but i think it might be worse for him now than if hed never gotten involved now youre starting to feel like everybody sold you out the mayor sold you the governor sold you out and now schultz sold you out
9136637 everything down to that last stapler to that office set
9136638 when its all said and done hell be playing on saturdays in big games
9136639 i had never put on a pair of shoulder pads in my life
9136640 there was a big learning curve the first few games i was kind of lost in the clouds
9136641 it was the only time i felt myself moving more than i like to be
9136642 wed down block on him and he was very difficult to move it was a good experience i learned tons in that game it was the fact i have to work that much harder i learned you got to hit him before he hits you because if youre the aggressor youre going to be in better position if youre the one getting hit usually youll be the one going down
9136643 its important its just something we do naturally you dont do the wrong thing you present yourself well youre courteous youre nice to people
9136644 theres hype about how good i am but no one has seen me play
9136645 i beat him a couple times but he got me
9136646 every week hed simulate the best defensive lineman and every week we thought he was better than the guy we faced
9136647 he can power you and hes athletic hes got a little wiggle with a defensive lineman you get them either fast or powerful what separates great defensive linemen is a guy who can do both
9136648 god gave me an obstacle to go through and i failed
9136649 then he gave me a second chance to go to servite to prove myself as a football player and student
9136650 i was on the wrong track it was my fault ive changed a lot it was sort of a wake up call for me
9136651 he knows when to have fun and when to work hes got this big smile
9136652 then nobody likes me the way i play i never talk i always have my game face on
9136653 the coach kept talking to me well buy you a house if you go to my school

9136661 the dreams are beautifully crafted fantasies each with an eerie atmosphere that brings us into a serene la la land where we feel free to imagine pleasing kate
9136662 i dont mean to be negative but i dont think its going to get better
9136663 i hope it responds but i have played with this for around six weeks it got a little better now its back to the same spot that it was
9136664 i want to play but i dont know if my leg will let me
9136665 he was much better this time than he was before his second setback hes clearly moving around better
9136666 i want to stay here we are still in this race and we playing really well at the right time
9136667 more than anything being in this park gave me confidence my body felt good and you know that you can get away with more mistakes than other places
9136668 it could be a lot worse but its all about me staying in shape mentally and physically the week im out and being view slide show of broncos cardinals game view slide show of broncos training camp watch video of the broncos cheerleaders at their calendar signing read lindsay jones entries on the all things broncos blog ask mike klis about the team or nfl in the broncos mailbag read the latest broncos commentaries by jim armstrong post photos of you and your loved ones showing broncos spirit play pickem for the upcoming broncos game there for my teammates and getting san diego when i get back
9136669 id like him not to have any suspensions but one is better than two i told him before you dont worry about something you cant control and just focus on football and i think hes done that

9136733 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9136734 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9136735 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9136736 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9136737 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9136738 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9136739 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9136740 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

9136743 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9136744 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9136745 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9136746 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9136747 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9136748 who are open to doing something on the production side
9136749 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9136750 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9136751 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9136752 there is something inherently mysterious about moments of insight such tales all share a few essential features which psychologists and neuroscientists use to define the insight experience the first of these is impasse before there can be a breakthrough there has to be a mental block another key feature of insight is the feeling of certainty that accompanies an idea
9136753 schooler had demonstrated that it was possible to interfere with insight by making people explain their thought process while trying to solve a puzzle a phenomenon he called verbal overshadowing this made sense to jung beeman since the act of verbal explanation would naturally shift activity over to the left hemisphere causing people to ignore the more subtle associations coming from the right side of the brain
9136754 jung beeman began searching in the right hemisphere for the source of insight in the brain he decided to compare puzzles solved in moments of insight with those solved by methodical testing of potential solutions in which people can accurately trace their thought process and had no sense of surprise when the answer came unfortunately all the classic puzzles developed by scientists to study insight required insight if subjects didnt solve them in a sudden aha moment they didnt solve them at all
9136755 jung beeman needed to develop a set of puzzles that could be solved either by insight or by analysis
9136756 the insight process as sketched by jung beeman and kounios is a delicate mental balancing act at first the brain lavishes the scarce resource of attention on a single problem but once the brain is sufficiently focused the cortex needs to relax in order to seek out the more remote associated in the right hemisphere which will provide the insight the relaxation phase is crucial jung beeman said thats why so many insights happen during warm showers another ideal moments for insights is the early morning right after we wake up the drowsy brain is unwound and disorganized open to all sorts of unconventional ideas
9136757 one of the surprising lessons of this research is that trying to force an insight can actually prevent the insight while its commonly assumes that the best way to solve a difficult problem is to focus minimize distractions and pay attention only to the relevant details this clenched state of mind many inhibit the sort of creative connections that lead to sudden breakthroughs
9136758 theres a good reason google figures he would use them as the example ed
9136759 as for wallach after he had drawn the diagram he started at it wondering for a moment where did that come from
9136760 to deal effectively with puzzles and with the bigger problems for which they may be a model you must operate on two or more levels simultaneously

9136768 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9136769 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9136770 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9136771 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9136772 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9136773 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9136774 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9136775 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9136776 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9136777 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9136778 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

9136797 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9136798 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9136799 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9136800 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9136801 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9136802 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9136803 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9136804 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9136805 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9136806 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9136807 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9136808 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9136809 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9136810 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9136811 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9136812 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9136813 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9136814 i wonder if using a single glyph violates their eula

9136821 sem pozabil povedati da sem te fuul dobr pritisnil saj dobr izgledas
9136822 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9136823 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9136824 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9136825 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9136826 hopefully we will find a way on it i think it will be possible for us to surmount some of these obstacles
9136827 nsg does not have ban on enrichment and reprocessing technology transfer per se unlike the us none of the countries have ban in their countries on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology
9136828 we dont want some countries individual predilections to be performing part of huge package of items in the nsg
9136829 it is uncalled for we have put all the cards on the table we have been as transparent as anyone else we are willing to make our case before the nsg we do not understand the need for the review mechanism
9136830 if we have periodic reviews they investors will say it should not be done
9136831 our concerns are well known i think most of the countries recognised the validity of our concerns there are some countries who i think are ideologically committed to their concepts of non proliferation and hence tend to take a sort of hardline position on this
9136832 i think it is a question of convincing them that india with an impeccable record in terms of non proliferation the fact that it has always stood for universal nuke disarmament is a right candidate for nuclear commerce
9136833 as long as it does not inhibit us from what we believe is clean and unconditional waiver
9136834 i am optimistic but i will not allow optimism to override caution
9136835 the work is in progress and i cannot tell you the details
9136836 yes constant dialogue is going on between new delhi and the us
9136837 i believe if anybody is friendly to us they will benefit
9136838 certainly not a debacle nor do i think it is a setback we were prepared for this because as we were told as it may be necessary to have two rounds before finalising something which would be mutually satisfactory

9136842 in terms of performance we know we are not playing at the level that we did in pre season
9136843 but now we have all the team available again i am sure that little by little start to see quality of the players
9136844 if we can play better then good if we cannot but we are still winning it will be a good solution
9136845 we have some knocks that we will have to check tomorrow
9136846 the only serious one is gerrard who had his operation today and will have another one tomorrow its not serious and normally it will be around 15 days
9136847 he will not be available for the internationals and he will be very close for the game against united
9136848 i was talking with capello this morning it was a good conversation and was very positive i was explaining to him the timescale and he understands the situation
9136849 this audit identified a number of items that were purchased without receiving the expected discount
9136850 were satisfied that the majority of errors have been corrected
9136851 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9136852 were still not sure there wont be a bump up in prices but it appears that this labor day in california is going to pass without much news
9136853 most of the prices around the country overnight were driven up in the southeast and east coast which depend on oil from the gulf coast
9136854 i checked all the regions and nobody had an overnight increase in the west
9136855 its going to depend on how much damage is done
9136856 what we learned with katrina is that while refineries in the gulf are not supplying the west coast it does play a part in the supply demand equation
9136857 thats because the southeast and other regions that are affected start looking for oil where the spigot is open and that can take away from the west so yes it does play a part in a roundabout way
9136858 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9136859 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9136860 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9136861 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9136862 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9136863 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

9136945 i want to make the 108 emergency response service ers one of the eight wonders of the world
9136946 recently i was in europe and people there were surprised by the scale and scope of our achievement
9136947 our mission is to save one million lives in a year
9136948 even as i am talking three ambulances are being launched taking the total to 303 it will be 320 by the end of next month
9136949 95 percent of the emergency calls are attended in one ring within two to three minutes the ambulance is on its way
9136950 health is most basic if good health prevails it helps other areas of progress for the government emri is one aspect more important is increasing the number of trauma centres so that critical patients can be taken directly by 108 service within the golden hour so that life can be saved
9136951 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires

9136953 there would be only two people of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today

9136956 initially there was tension between us but as we chatted about this and that and became more relaxed i discovered that he was a human being after all
9136957 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9136958 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
9136959 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
9136960 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
9136961 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
9136962 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side

9136968 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9136969 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9136970 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9136971 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9136972 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9136973 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9136974 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9136975 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9136976 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9136977 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process

9136996 he is as good a coach as i have ever worked with he demands respect and he demands perfection he has a tremendous rapport with the kids
9136997 we had a nice 90 yard drive but didnt do much offensively or defensively in the first two periods
9136998 our offense started clicking and looked the best it has this year in the second half
9136999 it looked good to look out there and see it moving the ball executing the offense
9137000 he was a big factor in our offensive execution in the second half
9137001 he settled down and ran the offense the offense and the defense really looked good in the second half
9137002 the league looks very strong and we have to get better to compete in this league
9137003 south johnston really tried to stack it up in the box to start with so that forced us to took to throw more
9137004 morton just did a great job getting the ball to our guys and they just made plays with the ball
9137005 the kids played hard even though it was a struggle
9137006 josh senegal stepped up and did a real good job and so did david highsmith
9137007 our offensive line really blocked well especially on that big drive
9137008 its a good feeling to be 2 0 but we have a tough schedule and a big game next week against southeast raleigh
9137009 i think we came out a little lackadaisical we looked it on the opening kickoff and missed some tackles
9137010 but then we kind of shored things up and played better we had a really good second half
9137011 and were trying to get to where they are tonight wasnt as much about the score but about the effort weve just got to put this past us and get ready for wakefield well start that monday morning
9137012 this claim by prime minister harper is an attempt by the governing party to silence the official loyal opposition on a matter of significant public interest pertaining to the government of canada
9137013 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off
9137014 i always had to chase the rhythm of playing on that particular surface that i was wanting to play on
9137015 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9137016 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9137017 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9137018 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9137019 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9137020 you probably dont remember that it was touch and go whether greece entered the eu when it did due to it being so backward at the time

9137032 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9137033 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9137034 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9137035 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9137036 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9137037 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue

9137074 dont you need somebody thats ready day 1 to be president of the united states
9137075 yeah it would be nice if the democrats nominated somebody like that
9137076 i would question why boys are not including in this vaccination programme as it is after all a sexually transmitted disease which can lead to the cancer males can be considered the vehicles for the transmission of these viruses with the population
9137077 perhaps the higher cost of this particular vaccine has led the government to choosing the current vaccine
9137078 with sexually transmitted diseases on the rise a vaccine must not be seen as the go ahead for sexual activity without protection
9137079 one of the causes of the increase in cervical cancer rates in the uk can be attributed in part to the age a girl becomes sexually active
9137080 the younger a girl becomes sexually active the greater the chance of developing cervical cancer
9137081 the aim of the programme is to prevent cervical cancer in women and the best way to do this is to vaccinate girls and young women
9137082 there was another man who was involved in inflicting serious injuries upon mr parkin that night
9137083 i believe there were people in bath street potentially in the company of mr parkin who have information that will identify this man
9137084 he has deep regret for getting himself involved in the incident at all
9137085 it was an incident that was not of his making
9137086 there are now more coaches more facilities more varied sports and more competition
9137087 by 2011 we will have the achieved the ultimate ambition that every child will be offered five hours of quality sport a week that will include coaching and competition for all
9137088 by the time the olympics start in 2012 im confident our school sport system will lead the world
9137089 todays announcement demonstrates our determination to do everything we can to get more young people regularly taking part in sport
9137090 i particularly welcome the extent to which the sports on offer through this initiative will be driven and determined by young people themselves
9137091 having their input will help sustain their enthusiasm and commitment to the programme
9137092 from my point of view as an elite athlete looking into sport the benefits of this are huge
9137093 i would welcome sport englands aim to educate children in sports
9137094 we all know the benefits of sport but by understanding any sport a kid will gain a lot of confidence
9137095 it is absolutely brilliant when you talk to people about sports and minority sports they dont think they are available
9137096 a lot of people question about taking up the sports because there arent facilities to do it
9137097 the more young people involved the better it is for the sports the better it is for me and the better it is for us all
9137098 we know we have the worst health in the north east compared to the rest of the country
9137099 there has been a lot of confusion from the start
9137100 it has been very emotional over the past few weeks and some people have been crying in the office
9137101 no one wanted to go but i feel i have been treated fairly and got a good redundancy package so now i just have to work out what to do with the rest of my life
9137102 it is the people who were forced to go and who have children and mortgages that i feel sorry for
9137103 it is a sad day and marks the end of a long ongoing drama
9137104 when it all kicked off people were worried about their jobs and as time has gone people began to realise what was going to happen in the long term but some are still a bit upset
9137105 the past few weeks have been a bit of a shock
9137106 it has been pretty dismal for some people but life goes on and we are all working together
9137107 this has been a very difficult period for the whole company
9137108 all parties staff unite the union and management have acted professionally and responsibly to ensure that the final outcome was achieved as sensitively as possible
9137109 i would like to pay a special tribute to all of our staff who have maintained high service standards to our customers throughout this difficult time their performance has been outstanding
9137110 they want to do some jamming maybe some cover versions as well
9137111 we were looking for unusual places to play and we were tipped off about the pub
9137112 it went brilliantly the tan hill is just a magical place
9137113 we are excited about it all we dont know how it is going to pan out
9137114 our client was extremely disappointed to find that you had chosen to support the hartlepool mail by supplying photographs taken at victoria park to them without our clients consent
9137115 as a result of your decision to assist the mail in this way our client took the decision to exclude your photographers from the ground
9137116 you have stated in recent articles that the paper has been banned from victoria park this is not accurate as it is only the photographers who have been banned and your reporters are able to attend the ground in the same way as any other member of the public
9137117 we continue to be saddened that hartlepool united should take this action against the two newspapers which have provided the most support to the club for many years
9137118 there was another man involved in inflicting serious injuries upon mr parkin that night
9137119 i believe there were people in bath street potentially in the company of mr parkin who have information that will identify this man
9137120 he has deep regret for getting himself involved in the incident at all
9137121 it was an incident that was not of his making
9137122 the deployment of air power despite the regrettable civilian casualties can be seen as militarily appropriate
9137123 the sudden war in the caucasus has dealt a blow to us prestige
9137124 europes leaders have understood that they must act but the complicated rules and regulations that govern the interplay of the 27 eu states are an invitation to distraction and quarrel the war in georgia shows that europe urgently needs a president and it lacks a common foreign minister who can forge a common foreign policy from among 27 national sensitivities it is not impossible the governments are ready the lisbon treaty is written the problem is not them up there but us here below we would have had our eu treaty in january had the majority in ireland not said no
9137125 as things now stand the crisis has renewed debate on georgias membership at the nato summit in april in bucharest merkel and steinmeier played a major role in preventing ukraine and the caucasus country from joining the alliances membership action plan map now that hostilities have erupted the germans are happy to keep as much distance as possible between them and georgia
9137126 strong criticism of the german position has also emerged from the american election campaign us presidential candidate john mccain has warned that withholding fast track membership for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for attacks on georgia somehow this makes germany partly responsible for the war in the caucasus at least in mccains eyes and that does not bode well for germany should the republican be elected president in november berlin actually had hoped that it only had to get through the last few months of the bush administration and then everything would get better but no matter who is president germanys relationship with the us promises to be fraught with tension should america allow itself to be provoked by russia
9137127 i think that a clear political statement is once again very important in this situation georgia is a free and independent country and every free and independent country can decide together with the members of nato when and how it joins nato in december there will be an initial assessment of the situation and we are clearly on track for a nato membership
9137128 moscows military leaders are not really afraid of the us missile defense system ten us interceptor missiles stand against thousands of russian warheads should it come to that as usual the main point is the respect and recognition of a russia which still has not come to terms with its loss of superpower status
9137129 there are so many unanswered questions especially as to the purpose of the missile shield since iran is obviously not yet capable of atomic weaponry and the world community wants to prevent them from obtaining such weapons which missiles is the anti missile shield going to intercept what is the nature of the threat how much will it cost the german taxpayer will there be further armament projects
9137130 concerns about possible threats emanating from putins unpredictable empire were never far from the minds of warsaw politicians after all have its eu partners in the west not criminally underestimated this danger and left the countries of eastern europe to fend for themselves against the russian bear time and time again in the past brussels did nothing when russia beat up on the baltic states with arbitrary trade restrictions when it launched a full scale cyber war against estonia and when it used specious arguments to ban polish food imports and thats not even mentioning the weak support given to the young wobbly ukrainian democracy as russia attempted to strong arm it
9137131 behind the delaying tactics is the hope that a new us administration under barack obama or hillary clinton will push the expensive missile defense with less determination than the republican bush
9137132 in eastern europe a new discussion about russia is developing that considers both the domestic and foreign policies being followed in the kremlin this mindset does not necessarily mean a new split of the nato alliance into the old us critical europeans and the new pro american europeans but it does show that the large european countries like germany and france must show more deference to the eastern european worldview
9137133 prague and warsaw are betting that their countries will be strategically more important for the united states and thus they will enjoy greater protection in the future all this is happening because of fear of ever more aggressive russia in western europe which did not experience a soviet invasion and martial law this fear is often mocked as being outdated but the recent russian invasion of georgia shows that it is a very relevant issue
9137134 that poland considering its past history with russia lacks the will to structure its priorities in another way lets say european is understandable but that the administration in washington at this point is pushing a cold war mood and is further splitting the alliance partners can mean only one thing that the current authorities have not learned from the mistakes of the past
9137135 i could not stand america this president bush has turned my homeland into a developing country everything is ailing infrastructure schools political institutions
9137136 i was happy to find an alternative to life in america
9137137 if barack obama wins the presidential elections then sooner or later i will return to the usa
9137138 obama makes us proud of our homeland we now once again have a r reason to love our country
9137139 americans have high expectations for the successor of george w bush the united states the greatest world power of all times has lost its authority bush stands for the war in iraq torture at abu ghraib for legal inflection in guantanamo for a reckless environmental policy the new president will have to clean up repair rectify he will have to give the country a new direction and the rest of the world as well
9137140 mccains supporters are older white and uneducated men by contrast obamas quasi european voters are female but especially young and smart
9137141 if democrats want to win they will have to rid themselves of their european appearance
9137142 i support ideas for the rest of the world barack embodies a new america and the rest of the world as well as the usa have earned a new america
9137143 a visible sign that the important thing in these deliberations is love is the rainbow flag that flew over the hamburg city hall from july 31 to august 3 to commemorate the local gay pride celebration
9137144 the cdu is germanys leading conservative party and its attitude toward creating a legal foundation for registered same sex partnerships has ranged from reluctance to rejection i am committed to attaining complete equality between married couples and registered life partners but in germany the time for this unfortunately has not yet arrived in germany many conservative people attach every bit as much importance to the remaining legal differences between heterosexual spouses and same sex partners as conservatives in the united states attach to the exclusive use of the term marriage to describe the bond between a man and a woman
9137145 a chair for the sick with small wheels the kind you see in old us movies
9137146 i would not exclude having said that but if they are going to provide us with such a splendid contraption they can at least help us out with it
9137147 prepared to fundamentally reconsider the course of us foreign policy
9137148 prohibiting obama from speaking at the gate would be like prohibiting foreign politicians from speaking at the national mall in washington just because martin luther king held his big speech there in 1963
9137149 when is he coming who will he meet and more importantly what will he say
9137150 the senator from illinois must take care not to seem overly pro european
9137151 its therefore unlikely that obama will wax lyrical about europes leadership on combating climate change or health insurance
9137152 there is a certain irony to it all it took a major war for george w bush to strain the transatlantic relationship but for his wannabe successor the campaigning senator from illinois all it takes is a speech announcement
9137153 what would otherwise be criticized as pretentious attention getting in the case of obama the social democrats it is labeled as
9137154 the awacs deployment may be logical but it shows once again how the german bundeswehr is logical step by logical step stumbling into the fighting in afghanistan overall it is a worrying development
9137155 attention must be given to this continuing scandal this incomprehensible stupidity this appalling result of imperial arrogance now that the united states has opened a new embassy building in such a spectacular location next to the brandenburg gate exactly there where 69 years ago there was an earlier embassy even if then as now without an ambassador he was recalled to washington after the reichspogromnacht november 9 10 1938 of the nazis against the jews today nothing has de facto changed although william r timken who holds the title of ambassador is physically present in the capital of the germans politically he is absent completely and he has absolutely nothing to say to germans at all
9137156 not only because subway security is taken much more seriously from new york to los angeles subway stations have security cameras and sheriffs more importantly drunkenness cannot be used as a mitigating factor to reduce prison sentences on the contrary it is illegal to drink under the age of 21 and in most states criminals who are 18 years old are treated as adults in some states this is the case even for 16 and 17 year olds
9137157 it is sick the heart it is empty it is old wrinkled used it beats only weakly it is slowly bleeding it offers little hope oh america how could it come to this there where the new man struggled to build his utopia of a new world with sweat on his brow but always aware while working his own piece of ground that he was a gentlemen servant to no one there where the air smelled like the sweet fragrance of freedom and the horizon reached to an infinite distance there in rural america in the heart of the nation in their mythical heartland the hard times are there to stay it was destroyed when agriculture rediscovered itself as an industry which required fewer workers and certainly no free self centered people
9137158 it is a symbol of how america deals with the war it started in the middle east thereby provoking the return of the protest culture he wants for the president to get lost and for the war to end
9137159 then it comes to the highpoint in georgia they play impeach the president the audience feeling lucky and besides themselves to be able to see the four ageing hippies crosby stills nash and young one last time in their lives becomes indignant there is a war going on and who turns his back on the country with such heavenly music deserves ripped up concert tickets and booing because pop and politics are two different things in predominantly apolitical in america
9137160 d j vu the film is way too late in considering the american presidential campaign one must instinctively think of a more recent campaign that of candidate barack obama the attacks on president bush are now outdated
9137161 popcorn meets provocation while the new american embassy on pariser platz was opened with great excitement last weekend a few hundred metres on the unter den linden a very different america is on display this is about sex and violence war and anti war demonstrations uniforms and naked bodies judaism and anti semitism
9137162 as a land of inner turmoil and deep identity crisis
9137163 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
9137164 everybody wants to bring up the mississippi state game or the lsu game or whatever
9137165 they dont want to bring up the arkansas game when he throws a touchdown the last play of the game
9137166 i dont think people really understood how important our senior class was when we were all seniors
9137167 its just unfortunate that he was the quarterback during that time i think hes done great
9137168 im sure especially as passhappy as they are now they have to be broken at some time im happy with what i did there and i love the state love the university
9137169 obviously hes thrown for a lot of yards but its all about winning games he goes out and wins 10 games this year and theyll love him he goes out and wins six itll be the same old questions
9137170 thats just how it is its what makes it fun
9137171 i went through three offenses in six months at one point in time
9137172 if you can get to the reacting stage as opposed to the thinking stage you kind of come full circle and its a lot easier
9137173 i truly believe hes going to have the best season yet he earned it during the offseason he done a lot of different things taken a lot of different strides has hasnt taken before
9137174 hes coming and working harder in practice you can tell he worked real hard during the summer and during camp he showed a lot of improvement to me just looking off the safety and going through his reads and knowing who to throw the ball to
9137175 one thing that i can tell is that hes really comfortable out there he just seems so settled down and so secure
9137176 im doing everything i can to finish out on the right note
9137177 the last year is the one people are going to remember

9137513 by the governments own admission the previous books contained biased and discriminatory content
9137514 the progress and development of a country depends on the quality of education of its people it is a historical fact that the muslims ruled the world for hundred of years on the basis of the knowledge acquired by their intellectuals philosophers and scientists
9137515 as long as the muslims acted upon the hadith to acquire knowledge is the duty of each muslim male and female they ruled the world
9137516 this discrimination entirely goes against the students of other faiths in pakistan and it becomes very difficult for them to get admission in higher education so these discriminatory marks must be immediately abolished

9137576 the story songs came out of conversations between pierre kaiser the dimes lead guitarist moog master and backing vocalist and i we work the same day job and usually eat lunch together i used to write boy girl songs like most pop writers but at lunch im always talking about stories i read in the newspapers pierre said why dont you write story songs theyd be better than the crap youve been bringing me lately i was already working on catch me jumping which is a true story about a friend who joined the navy he was out at sea and ended up jumping off the ship i think as a cry for help wed just been in japan playing shows on us bases including the one he was stationed to he was on a tight leash and had to check in with the guards before he could make any move it was a real story and the other guys in the band had such a positive reaction to it it got me addicted to the idea of story songs it was a combination of pierre telling me to get off my ass and stop trying to fit into some mold and my realization after writing catch me jumping that it could be a great thing i started working on the battle of san jacinto which i grew up hearing about in school in san antone i did some research and found out what both sides were experiencing and it was my first history song when i saw how much fun it was to write and how rewarding it was story songs became the story of the band for the next year and a half
9137577 pierre has an old house hes renovating which made it a perfect studio
9137578 he had isolated all the instruments in empty rooms and set up a studio in the basement we were going over for an all weekend session and when we showed up pierre had a stack of tattered newspapers on the kitchen table hed torn up the kitchen floor and under the floor someone had used these newspapers for insulation they were laid flat and in good shape we must have read then for an hour and the page he handed me was a world news page from the long gone oregonian daily journal it had headlines like reds riot in new york and man awake for 15 years cant pay his club bill and emmy destin dies in czechoslovakia i couldnt stop reading the man awake story was about captain paul kern who was shot in the head in wwi they saved his life but the bullet hit the part of his brain that controls sleep and fatigue he never slept again for the rest of his life he hung out at a club to find people to talk to at three in the morning i started singing paul kern cant sleep i stayed up all night and wrote paul kern i showed up for rehearsal the next day and played it and we all got excited we spent the day jamming on it and the parts came together i got three songs from that one page of newsprint we would have had fun making whatever album we would have made but after those newspapers it veered from one history song to three then seven more
9137579 we recorded and produced ourselves in our various bedrooms basements and attics using pro tools
9137580 but theres such a thing as being too perfect if we dont nail it in one take it goes out and we do it again i cant stand pitch correction i think relying on it is abusing the technology we usually play live over an acoustic guitar and vocal demo that i lay down with a click track so we get that live feel if you know what youre going for you can capture the raw element without sounding too digital
9137581 to follow a girl the age old story but were now married so it was a good move
9137582 i responded to an ad looking for a john lennon for a beatles tribute band and got the job but the band only lasted three gigs at the second gig i met pierre who invited me over to his house to jam with his roommate jake rahner who played drums we started getting together weekly after writing a few songs we put an ad for a bass player on craigs list and a few other sites and ryan showed up after we played one song with him we asked him to join
9137583 were aiming to have the next group of songs ready by early 09 when pierre told me he grew up in boston i started to research the city as if i were going on a trip boston was the center of early american history so i finished a boston song i had so much fun finding out about that history i thought maybe we should have a couple of boston tunes i wrote about the ride of paul revere in the first person and now i have 18 songs about people from boston or events that happened there clara barton who started the american red cross was from boston the sacco venzetti trial took place in boston and led to the riot i wrote about in new york 1930 the presiding judge in the case webster thayer had made up his mind before the trail that they were gonna fry and told his friends at his country club he was gonna throw the book at them they lost the trial and appealed but he was the appellate judge and denied their appeal five times which caused riots all over the world london new york moscow the chicago 1929 song was about the great chicago fire which was the biggest in american history but a year later in 1872 we had the great boston fire i wasnt planning to tie the new songs to the first record but i found all these connections when i started to investigate the history of boston its amazing how the threads of our history are so intertwined

9137602 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
9137603 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
9137604 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now
9137605 i dont think anybody would get real upset if they found out ill be 30 in a couple of weeks but why take a chance
9137606 shell kill me if you print this but our drummer is
9137607 did you see dave edmunds and rockpile at the roxy a couple of months ago or carl perkins at the whisky i didnt hear anybody calling them too old did you you could put four 59 year old men together and if they rocked like that nobody would call them old
9137608 throughout history men have been reaching their peaks at around 33 look at mozart and alexander the great and jesus if only people under 30 were allowed to play it it would be rocks loss
9137609 a couple of times when i was broke i had to join groups that were more like 9 to 5 punch in punch out jobs than music
9137610 but everybody kept asking me why i wasnt playing until i realized that i wasnt being true to my school as the beach boys would say that playing the guitar is what im really around to do
9137611 this is the last group ill ever be in full time if we dont get signed im going to find myself a nice well paying probably deathly boring job and live comfortably again ive done enough starving

9137664 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9137665 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9137666 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9137667 she seems like a compelling person and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9137668 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
9137669 going surfing is a big part of my creative process
9137670 surfing has always been a big part of my life ive surfed since i was nine years old leaving land is my favorite part of it i like being in a separate reality
9137671 its still my favorite thing to listen to a story through a song its like nothing else a song can preserve time and memory and history in a way that words or a picture alone cant a song can capture it all
9137672 it was a great time and a life changing time for me i felt like i had a peer group not only did i identify as far as politics and music but also age wise i had been with people because they were lesbian and women and we had a lot in common but they were all a lot older so for once i fit in where could a freak fit in in punk rock
9137673 so i came back from san francisco and the only people i knew here were lesbians and no way man i wanted punk rock i started going out to punk shows i would put on a little suit and tie and i would go there and try to look so cool though i didnt know a soul
9137674 he walks up to me and says hey want to be in a band
9137675 the fashions changed and the politics changed and people were wearing the swastika which they hadnt been up to that time because im jewish i would notice and it pissed me off so i wrote a song called take off your swastika it was right around the same time the dead kennedys wrote nazi punks fuck off i wrote the song as a direct personal reaction to the swastikas and i decided to play it on my acoustic guitar up til then id been playing electric guitar and synthesizer nobody in punk was really playing acoustic guitar at that time and the reason i did it was because i really wanted the words to be heard because as far as im concerned punk rock is the folk music of today though i didnt play it at some folk club i played it at punk rock clubs
9137676 people would yell and id get heckled and stuff but on the whole it was pretty great i remember playing at the whisky and seeing a couple of guys taking off their swastikas

9137728 coach let me be the closer i can do it
9137729 teaching is just a way to pay the bills until i finish my novel
9137730 its a piece of would anyone like to smoke some pot
9137731 if mccain thinks im going to vote for him just because he chose a woman
9137732 i am the democratic candidate for president not the catholic candidate
9137733 you look over the years that theyve been in that offense and it has been amazingly productive
9137734 when its at its height its very difficult to get a handle on
9137735 what youre trying to do in the spread offense is get some mismatches
9137736 theres the spread with the option that oregon has done very successfully
9137737 theres the spread at texas tech where they throw it all the time but its about spreading and splitting people up and finding out what the matches are
9137738 i felt like our defense was prepared but we didnt come out and make the plays we were supposed to
9137739 he has a hands on approach and shows us what to do instead of just telling us but mostly its just more fun
9137740 you got to stay in gaps and really just know where help is
9137741 you may think the ball is going one way but you have to stay in your gap
9137742 and trust your teammate is going to be in his and make his play if you think one runner has the ball and you jump out you might make the play the first time but i guarantee hes reading you for the next time you jump out and hes gone up the seam
9137743 it is fundamental when you look up and see you won the game youd say they tackled youd say the team leveraged well those are the key ingredients to getting the job done
9137744 weve got to keep ourselves in the right places and try to eliminate the individual plays where its just one on one
9137745 we have to see if somehow we can get our advantage to be a two on one where we can make some plays
9137746 obviously weve talked about the inexperience at some places but we also talked about some of the enthusiasm the intensity that they bring being new being untarnished not having any of the blemishes that weve had in the past
9137747 im ready to win so im going to do whatever it takes if that means staying in my gap and hitting an offensive lineman and not making any tackles thats what im going to do ill be happy i trust my teammates
9137748 the most experienced quarterback on oregons roster even before nate costa went down is backup jeremiah masoli who played one season at city college of san francisco that is the ducks biggest concern as they try to replace dennis dixon yes justin roper threw four touchdown passes in the sun bowl but his r sum needs a little padding defensively the ducks figure to have their strongest unit in years and stuck in its craw are the 34 points it allowed washington last season its also a defense that has had a month to prepare for jake locker so dont look for another 89 points scored in this one

9137755 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested my back was throbbing from his knee

9137759 what we brought right there thats what we need to bring tonight
9137760 when we step on that field we are different people we are bulldogs
9137761 this is our place they ranted about us theyre not going to come in here and do that to us
9137762 its here its now and it is what it is lets go out there and get it done
9137763 i thought this year was going to be the one to retire
9137764 we have clear cut orders from the provincial government and the military to complete the operation until the militants are flushed out and the writ of the government is established
9137765 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9137766 could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all
9137767 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9137768 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9137769 as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard
9137770 kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9137771 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9137772 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9137773 if the governor of alaska cannot tell whether this paper is science or an elaborate editorial what is a less sophisticated audience to think
9137774 i hope its worth all the money thats been invested
9137775 our position as a party has always been the more disclosure the better its something that pat takes very seriously we will amend the report
9137776 when donors dont provide complete information we search the internet and other campaign reports if were unable to find information through these avenues we call the donor often multiple times
9137777 there was certainly no secret that these folks work here
9137778 i have a very high regard for both of them
9137779 the obama campaign has spent more in north carolina than anybody has in a long time
9137780 i dont think that the enthusiasm is going to continue
9137781 i believe that 28 to 30 percent of democrats will either choose to stay home or vote for mccain
9137782 the get out the vote effort is going to be unprecedented in the states history
9137783 i think some old line democrats will be hung up on race issues
9137784 but enough new people will be registered to offset that
9137785 most past election years we have been in a defensive posture
9137786 i want people here to know that im gonna be fighting as hard as i can for them and joe biden is gonna be fighting as hard as he can for them to create new jobs in high growth industries like clean energy
9137787 you cant get much better than joe biden hes a good man
9137788 it was a hard hard decision and i wouldnt even want to represent it as a clear case
9137789 the terrible error in judgment that he made and that somehow some way people would think that we thought that was ok and its not ok
9137790 i suspect that if we had not had the opportunity to work with him first hand that he would not be employed here
9137791 he wasnt hired to be a professional athlete he was hired to be a coach and teacher
9137792 what i did was 100 percent wrong theres no excusing that i know i have an obligation and duty to speak out against the use of banned substances
9137793 when i put my hand down i feel like a giant out there said the 300 pound sophomore whose team opens the season against mcneese state tonight
9137794 i dont care how big you are how fast you work if youre stronger than me ill outthink you if youre smart ill overpower you if youre fast im going to be quicker than you every time im out there im just going to figure out how to be better than you
9137795 im going to do whatever i can to help my team win
9137796 one of the dreams for me is to turn this thing around to be remembered as one of the guys who helped bring carolina back
9137797 youve got to have that confidence and swagger and the opponent in front of you has no chance
9137798 if youve got that youve already won and youre a step ahead
9137799 when he first got here i was like what in the world kind of monster is this
9137800 but once you got to know marvin hes funny and great to be around and hes a team player who wants this team to go to the acc championship and to bigger things the national championship
9137801 physically me and kentwan were probably on the same level in the weight room last year but he had the knowledge the experience the technique
9137802 just going out there and seeing how he practiced how he took coaching how he interacted with players and coaches and how they loved to be around him it just helped me see what i wanted to become and i where i want to go with my football career
9137803 they figured out how to use rosies ramp in about two seconds
9137804 now they enjoy full access to the bed where we all sleep together
9137805 theyre a nice way to separate the hard toys from the soft toys
9137806 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
9137807 carrie needs someone who is going to stick by her
9137808 she was devastated when her relationship with tony romo broke the last thing she needs is a relationship with another high profile celebrity whos going to end up loving and leaving her
9137809 although computers have helped cut down what we need to file we will always have papers to deal with
9137810 its not personal mine should be in here too somewhere
9137811 finding osama bin laden would be easier than finding the key
9137812 i guarantee you parents of 15 year olds all over are going through the same thing
9137813 you think you should have to move a lawn mower to get to your birth certificate
9137814 people think when they throw something away it negates their past that just isnt true
9137815 most families dont take the time to sit down and evaluate how much they can spend on back to school shopping
9137816 a childs back to school budget should cover all the needs
9137817 and some of the wants not the other way around
9137818 do school supplies one day clothes another day shoes another
9137819 if you have multiple kids consider taking them shopping individually
9137820 you can get a lot of the same stuff that youd get at nordstrom rack or the mall
9137821 i have four kids so i have to spread the budget out
9137822 i like hollister and abercrombie amp fitch they always fit perfectly here you can get them for a good price
9137823 parents cant afford to pay 700 to clothe all their kids
9137824 they can come here and pay 50 percent less and get 50 percent more as long as kids dont care about wearing used clothing theyll get everything they need
9137825 have the time to shop so you can take the time to look and try things on
9137826 i dont think of our store as a thrift store
9137827 when shoppers get a sense of the clothes we carry the thrift idea fades away
9137828 sometimes the themes got a little goofy i did one entire theme where everything revolved around crepes from the appetizer to crepes suzette for dessert
9137829 we did a lunch meat tasting which i thought was kind of a silly idea it was my husbands idea and i think he may have been watching too much sopranos at the time but it turned out good now i have mortadella with pistachios in my fridge all the time

9137836 a political will is needed to further strengthen the police force including giving them more legal powers and resources i requested the prime minister to immediately pass gujarats law against organised crime which has been passed twice by the assembly and has been lying with the centre for the past four years it is important to understand that this law exists in maharashtra and if a bomb blast takes place they can use it but if it happens in gujarat just 50 km away i dont have the law i want to tell those politicians who have their minds filled with vote bank politics that there were terrorist activities even when pota was in force and that despite having section 302 of ipc which gives death penalty for murder murders do take place does this mean we remove this clause i apprised them about the information revealed by the terrorists arrested for their involvement in the ahmedabad blasts there is a need for co ordination between the centre and states and also among the states to combat terror it has come to light that states which are doing well economically are especially being targeted i requested the prime minister to call a meeting of such states and he has agreed to it i also requested the prime minister that since gujarat is a border and coastal state there is a need to re look and upgrade its security i am not here as a bjp leader but as a voice of the gujarat assembly which represents 5 5 crore people we should face terrorism as a united force
9137837 shes perfect for the job she may be the best queen weve ever had
9137838 they said they wouldnt even need to audition anyone else if they had me such flattery how could i refuse
9137839 im partial to the gentry i like to stay clean and look pretty
9137840 but i get that a lot and how cool would that be even if there was no magic on my side of the family
9137841 my first free weekend will be in january of 2009
9137842 but i feel like the whole thing is going to be thrilling there are so many responsibilities im excited to be the main attraction i love the idea of being able to yell at someone and not get in trouble for it

9137859 in my early years i assiduously followed this threefold course first i read through the entire bible three times a year eight chapters in the old testament and two in the new testament daily i steadily persevered in this for ten years in order to familiarize myself with its contents which can only be done by consecutive reading second i studied a portion of the bible each week concentrating for ten minutes or more each day on the same passage pondering the order of it the connection between each statement seeking a definition of the important terms in it looking up all the marginal references being on the look out for its typical significance third i meditated on one verse each day writing it out on a slip of paper in the morning memorizing it consulting it at odd moments through the day pondering separately each word in it asking god to open for me its spiritual meaning and to write it on my heart the verse was my food for that day meditation standing to reading as mastication does to eating the more some such method as the above be followed out the more shall we be able to say thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path ps 119 105

9137887 it started from a conversation between adam and myself complaining about photoshop
9137888 he was definitely out playing me for the first two sets
9137889 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9137890 then the clock struck 12 and i felt a lot better playing out here as a 26 year old
9137891 ive been off for a while but im going to get better with every match i play if this crowd comes with me who knows

9137895 all that stuff doesnt matter to me were here to race
9137896 when hes won this year ive congratulated him and when ive won hes congratulated me what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is that we race well
9137897 it was great it was one of the most exciting things thats happened in this sport in a while
9137898 i guarantee you that those guys nascar officials who issued the probation sitting up there were saying we hate to have to do this the last thing you want is for these guys to calm down
9137899 i dont think im good at trash talking or the mental game of pulling up to someones bumper during practice
9137900 tony stewart is one of those guys it really comes down to personality
9137901 weve hit on some setups that have really worked for me and made me say yeah this is what im looking for
9137902 its definitely been a tough year for us regans bread and butter has been the short tracks
9137903 while weve definitely done better on the bigger tracks like the 2 mile auto club speedway oval

9137923 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9137924 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
9137925 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9137926 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9137927 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9137928 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing

9137960 in this hour of crisis we must come forward in favour of our big brother bihar
9137961 now i should do my best to carry on with the business of government
9137962 the party has the right to advise the government on matters of party policy and implementation of promises made to the people
9137963 but if we find that there is something wrong well pull up the government
9137964 if there is a mistake the party will intervene and take action i have already sent a signal to some ministers who dont listen to party workers wait and see the results
9137965 some appointments like special executive officers seos and the ones to state run corporations have been pending for a long time i have asked for detailed information and will soon take up the issue with the chief minister
9137966 my policy is to take everyone with me and steer the party to victory
9137967 and it is because officials committed mistakes i have written to the chief minister two days ago to set up a committee of local elected representatives to monitor the implementation of the packages
9137968 some senior people in the party at times get hurt when a newcomer is given importance but it should be remembered that while the party needs the knowledge and experience of seniors it also has to make use of newcomers by giving them responsibilities
9137969 we have already presented our case to the nsg we have told them that india is interested in getting a clean waiver
9137970 the agreement with the nsg has to be within the ambit of the july 18 statement we cannot accept any more conditions than what is there in that statement
9137971 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9137972 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9137973 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9137974 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament
9137975 hopefully we will find a way on it i think it will be possible for us to surmount some of these obstacles on demands for exclusion of enrichment and reprocessing technology in the nsg waiver he said it will not be acceptable to india
9137976 nsg does not have ban on enrichment and reprocessing technology transfer per se unlike the us none of the countries have ban in their countries on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology
9137977 we dont want some countries individual predilections to be performing part of huge package of items in the nsg
9137978 it is uncalled for we have put all the cards on the table we have been as transparent as anyone else we are willing to make our case before the nsg we do not understand the need for the review mechanism
9137979 if we have periodic reviews they investors will say it should not be done
9137980 our concerns are well known i think most of the countries recognised the validity of our concerns there are some countries who i think are ideologically committed to their concepts of non proliferation and hence tend to take a sort of hard line position on this
9137981 i think it is a question of convincing them that india with an impeccable record in terms of non proliferation the fact that it has always stood for universal nuke disarmament is a right candidate for nuclear commerce
9137982 as long as it does not inhibit us from what we believe is clean and unconditional waiver
9137983 i am optimistic but i will not allow optimism to override caution
9137984 the work is in progress and i cannot tell you the details
9137985 yes constant dialogue is going on between new delhi and the us
9137986 i believe if anybody is friendly to us they will benefit

9137988 the process of getting ministerial views is on i am not aware of the hrd ministry writing to us and opposing it however there are oppositions and objections to every proposal and these are sorted out
9137989 it is a well accepted maxim in law that not only must justice be done but it must appear to be done it is in that context that the committee recommends that an eoc should be constituted by the government to look into the grievances of deprived groups
9137990 the widespread feeling of discrimination among the muslim community will be addressed by setting up an equal opportunities commission to look into the grievances of deprived groups an expert group will be set up to examine and determine the structure and function of an eoc we expect this mechanism to operate in a manner which gives confidence to the minorities that any denial of equal opportunity or bias or discrimination in dealing with them will be attended to and redressal given

9137998 the area where this distressing incident took place is as everybody knows under the control of the resistance hezbollah
9137999 hezbollah must explain and not justify what happened because the death of a brilliant officer cannot be justified whatever the circumstances of the incident

9138066 we wanted to get a taste of what losing feels like so we dont taste it again
9138067 i kept getting the question of how we were going to replace cam and his yardage and electrifying plays but i knew we had brian williams
9138068 hes the one who told me that ill eventually get my chance to shine he told me not to worry about anything else just play your game and here we are now
9138069 hes the best conditioned kid on our team he played every play on offense and defense
9138070 you can expand your offense so much more when you have a quarterback like him
9138071 i think those penalties they had in the first half helped get us some confidence
9138072 we wanted to prove that we are more than just terrelle
9138073 we just got some new playmakers who were just covered by guys last year that were good and theres people behind the starters right now that are good it just shows its a team effort
9138074 this definitely sent a message out because east allegheny is a good team this shows were not just terrelle were a team
9138075 we have a lot of pieces to be very good but right now we have a lot of work ahead of us
9138076 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9138077 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts
9138078 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9138079 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9138080 we know some people who might be hurt who own rental housing
9138081 that would have a negative impact on the people we serve
9138082 one of the things we do here is home ownership counseling
9138083 now most of our requests are for people in mortgage default thats affected us and our workload
9138084 many of these folks have very low incomes so they really have to get a federal rental voucher and getting a voucher is much more difficult
9138085 theres more competition for scarcer resources weve seen some apartment buildings go under
9138086 bankers i think have often been stereotyped as being ones who insist on good credit
9138087 and then when this happened we suddenly found out that bankers didnt give a damn about it
9138088 hopefully it will really lead people to call into question what kind of entry level home lending is available

9138111 it offers a tremendous reduction in size and weight but without compromising on functionality so users have everything they need for life on the move
9138112 criticized by the west russian president dmitry medvedev on thursday asked china and four ex soviet nations to sign a declaration of support for russias role in the conflict in georgia but russias hopes of gathering support were dealt a huge blow when the five countries denounced the use of force and called for respect for every countrys territorial integrity the joint declaration from the shanghai cooperation organization deepens russias international isolation
9138113 as the talk gets tougher so compromise will be harder to find could it be that the chinese fresh from their tremendous olympic triumph will choose to cement their central role on the world stage by offering to host a crisis summit someone needs to mediate in this worsening atmosphere of distrust and belligerence and beijing looks to be the most qualified to take the job

9138118 mrs bell heard banging on the door and thought it was her husband and thought he had locked himself out
9138119 she looked through the front door peephole and saw el paso police department officers yelling open the damn door now
9138120 mrs bell told them to wait because she did not have clothes on she then saw that there were ready to hit her door with a battering ram so she opened the door a little so the officers could see her face
9138121 an officer immediately shoved or pushed against the door and barged into the house carrying a shotgun four other eppd officers ran in behind him none of the eppd officers said they had a warrant and they never showed plaintiffs any warrant or paperwork
9138122 to look through her house to make sure that her son was not there
9138123 once the officers saw that rickey bell jr was not at the residence they left the residence verified the fact that rickey bell had already been jailed

9138159 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
9138160 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
9138161 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
9138162 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
9138163 darfur is a rich region swimming over a lake of oil darfur has large quantity of minerals like copper iron and uranium there is also aluminum nitrate and a very large aquifer there is animal wealth and agricultural land
9138164 we have no problem with them americans coming and sharing it with us but they want to take it all
9138165 there is no reason for targeting us except first of all we are against israels policies in the region and the palestinian people we are also opposed to us policies going at the arab and islamic region
9138166 they southern sudanese have a right of self determination by the end of the interim period in 2011
9138167 they think that the darfur issue is the last means to undermine sudan because if peace is realized in darfur and a solution is found there will be no other problem left
9138168 the first project was the new sudan plan this means that sudan must be emptied of the arabs and kept distant from islam
9138169 they hoped to do this through the splm and the war in southern sudan or through the darfur war
9138170 the icc is a new colonialist tool to bring to their knees all the states that they want to force to capitulate the leaders of these states might be charged these courts are aimed against the third world states
9138171 for instance all the atrocities that the us and israel perpetrated in terms of killing and bombing of civilians were not questioned by the court when asked about that they said that the united states was not a member of the court sudan is also not a member
9138172 the target is not ahmad haroun or ali kushayb the target is sudan if we start dealing with this court or making concessions other ones will be requested
9138173 we will not hand over any sudanese citizen as i have said in the news conference no matter what the pressures are even if we go to war we are willing to fight a war with superpowers to protect the sudanese citizen
9138174 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan
9138175 if the government rejects the un forces it will ask them to leave we will not target these forces these are african forces in the first place
9138176 we will not submit sudan by an agreement or as a concession those who want to take sudan must come with their armies and occupy it
9138177 most of world nations support us including the un security council unsc permanent member states
9138178 i believe eric is a very special artist in japanese music history i dont know anyone else like him
9138179 it was real different from being in america everywhere you go there are people walking everywhere walking and walking also i didnt see any overweight people but that might have been just where i was
9138180 it was kind of rough where i grew up there were a bunch of pawnshops and fast food restaurants and there was only one school that everybody went to
9138181 she was the best looking girl at school but she only really knew how to speak japanese everyone was trying to talk to her so i figured i had to come up with something different i learned a few japanese phrases to say and she wound up giving me her number by the time i was able to conversate sic with her she had to go back to japan
9138182 i looked at the books and there were a whole bunch of definitions i didnt know i realized in order to learn japanese i had to go back and master english first so i went back and learned how to diagram a sentence learned about subjects direct objects adverbs positives and all that stuff then i transferred it to japanese and it all began to make sense
9138183 she was around 31 had a nice shaped body and long brown hair i never missed a day in class and always studied but i just wanted to see the teacher really
9138184 most of my friends were experimenting with making music and coming up with beats i figured i could try it in japanese that was about a year ago in october 2006 i put my first couple of songs on myspace
9138185 i remember one day coming home from work and i had gotten 2 000 song plays on myspace in a single day i kind of knew something was happening then
9138186 the way girls shake it it bounces up and down when they dance and it kind of looks like wings flapping
9138187 more and more japanese people started showing up on my page i started reading what people were saying about me and this one guy said i was like the underground king of japan
9138188 they sent me a message over myspace and said they wanted to try out some things i went and got my songs mastered on cd and they started setting up some tour dates for japan
9138189 one semester of japanese each so they could get the sounds right
9138190 over at this one club band member mr tokyo started talking to this one girl but i guess she already belonged to someone else her boyfriend got kind of upset and started screaming all kinds of stuff then security came in and we had to go and after another show we went outside to sign some autographs and we got kind of loud i guess someone called the cops so we got kind of a police escort on our way to our next show
9138191 it sold 1 000 copies in the first week of release
9138192 im going back to school and trying to find the time to go back to japan were going to be making a music video there and collaborating with some japanese rappers like k dub shine and dj oasis but i also really want to make international hip hop with all kinds of languages im trying out rapping in spanish now to see how it would sound but i always want to put japan first i like japan and i learned the language and now i just want to share it most americans who hear my stuff want me to remake my songs in english but i dont really feel like doing that id rather rap in all other languages except english you know try something different

9138202 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city
9138203 we support the development of the city in the best possible way
9138204 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali
9138205 there will be no giving up of the old towns heritage and landmarks

9138208 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9138209 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9138210 its been kind of my goal the last month or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9138211 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my mind to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9138212 who the fuck is this woman what does she bring to the ticket how can she be considered qualified to be president should her running mate be elected and die or be incapacitated how do i properly prepare moose

9138214 sau cand am spus n am fost destul de ferma si m am lasat convinsa ca pot mai mult
9138215 die kontakte gehen auf die 24 stunden von spa francorchamps zur ck damals wurde ich gefragt ob ich in einem wiechers auto fahren wollte
9138216 ich fahre f r ekris autosport und musste zuerst mit ihnen abkl ren ob es dadurch irgendwelche probleme geben w rde sie standen der sache allerdings positiv gegen ber sie helfen gerne dabei niederl ndische fahrer in die beste tourenwagen serie der welt zu hieven
9138217 sie konnten schon einige mal die privatier wertung gewinnen und nutzen einen bmw um das zu bewerkstelligen nat rlich hat wiechers nach sponsoren gefragt und auch in diesem punkt hat mir mein team weitergeholfen abgesehen davon ist das einfach eine gro artige m glichkeit f r mich mein potential aufzuzeigen was mir hoffentlich f r den rest des jahres behilflich sein wird
9138218 ich w rde sehr gerne wieder in macau fahren ich habe dort in den vergangenen jahren schon tolle ergebnisse eingefahren jedes mal war ich dabei in einem bmw unterwegs und es w re wirklich klasse das in diesem jahr zu wiederholen
9138219 dadurch k nnen wir uns etwas kennen lernen und uns an die rennen herantasten die qualifikation wird gewiss keine leichte aufgabe werden denn es gibt einige werksteams und die unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen wagen sind nur gering
9138220 aber vielleicht k nnen wir im ersten rennen ein gutes ergebnis einfahren und uns damit eine noch bessere ausgangslage f r den zweiten lauf erarbeiten mir ist klar dass ich in der privatier wertung keinerlei punkte sammeln kann das h ngt mit meinen fr heren resultaten zusammen ich m chte allerdings dennoch alles f r das team geben denn das ist ihr heimrennen
9138221 vielleicht haben wir ja etwas gl ck weil das wochenende dann richtig gut verlaufen k nnte
9138222 es wird spitze sein wieder gegen tom coronel fahren zu k nnen denn normalerweise fahren wir gemeinsam in der deutschen langstreckenmeisterschaft vln hier sind wir gegner und darauf freue ich mich schon

9138236 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9138237 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9138238 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9138239 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9138240 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9138241 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9138242 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9138243 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9138244 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9138245 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9138246 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9138247 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9138248 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9138249 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9138250 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9138251 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9138252 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9138253 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9138254 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9138255 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9138256 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9138257 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9138258 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9138259 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9138260 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9138261 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9138262 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9138263 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9138264 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9138265 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9138266 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9138267 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9138268 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9138269 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9138270 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9138271 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9138272 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9138273 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9138274 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9138275 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9138276 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9138277 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9138278 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9138279 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9138280 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9138281 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9138282 faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable
9138283 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9138284 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9138285 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9138286 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

9138288 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9138289 they are way too small to make it on their own
9138290 we do everything we can to keep them isolated from people so they wont seek a bond with us
9138291 one of the major motivations for writing the book is that were so isolated from the natural world a large part of that is the electronic isolation
9138292 people are trying to live in this artificial electronic world and theyre simply not in contact with the real world its a worrisome business one of major reasons for writing the book was to encourage people to get out into the natural world
9138293 much of my free time was spent running around like crazy in the woods
9138294 today everybody seems to be so scared to let kids out that they never have a chance to enjoy the natural world all their grandchildrens lives we take them out in the woods see everything pick the berries notice the birds
9138295 our kids have had that experience and you can see it most kids dont and im afraid people are so worried about letting kids out that they dont allow them to do the natural things
9138296 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9138297 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9138298 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9138299 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9138300 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9138301 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9138302 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9138303 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9138304 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9138305 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9138306 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9138307 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9138308 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9138309 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9138310 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9138311 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9138312 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9138313 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9138314 just over three hours ago in response to increasing and credible evidence and with due consideration to the significant risks involved our colleagues at the office of world security in new york ordered a special response team to secure the assets of mr mark mcguire and mcguire management corporation this was a necessary prerequisite to a detailed investigation concerning the so called layla repository this operation required extensive planning and was i am proud to say successfully executed at sites in manhattan and southampton a number of people have been requested to assist with the investigation which is currently underway the highly trained special response team conducted their business as effectively and efficiently as possible however as many people would now be aware there was some resistance on the part of mr mcguire as a result of this he did sustain some injuries that have unfortunately left him in a coma he is receiving the very best medical care that mount sinai can offer whilst he has a very important role to play in the investigation the ows will defer to the expertise of the medical staff on the question of his availability now we dont usually get involved in hearsay but due to the high visibility of this matter we feel it necessary to address certain rumours that are circulating on the stream namely a that this operation was an attempt by world fed to somehow silence layla and b mcguires injuries were intentional in respect of mcguire we desperately need his input for the investigation his current incapacitation in no way benefits us its a preposterous allegation this is simply not the way we do business at world fed and our track record bears this out as for suppressing the layla repository well we cant go through the evidence in detail out of respect for the ongoing investigation but we can present some facts for the consideration of those tempted by the stream innuendos mcguire as he admitted himself does have links to known terrorists qbp the company providing technical expertise on the repository have refuted mcguires sensationalist claims theres nothing especially miraculous about this stream feed and qbp have proven that the repository feed was tampered with why did mcguire publicize these fabrications who knows but what cant be argued against is that mcguire was deeply involved in the development of a bidding war to secure a vast price for himself and his still secret client we dont even know if the original repository feed is an authentic record of real life events or just someones fiction either way world fed is committed to transparency and fundamentally believes in the capability of this worlds citizens to make up their own minds we have retained the independent services of qbp and will provide free access to the layla repository to everyone once all traces of corruption have been removed we have been reminded how powerful and positive was laylas role in bringing unity to our world we can announce that we will be funding the development of a number of initiatives in order to keep her foremost in our minds in particular world fed is designating her birthday the 25 th of january as layla day we intend to make this first one very special indeed we all hope that someday she will reappear but its not something we have control over in the meantime rather than chasing shadows and clasping at straws however well meaning the intentions let us honour her in the best manner possible by demonstrating and further implementing the oneness of humankind by protecting what we have achieved and by investing in our future possibilities joels anger spread out from his sternum with the fiery warmth of a whiskey tsunami comforting numbing and debilitating the moan back on the street where he used to live in victoria but not victor yes sixty five and stuck in his late parents house cold and sterile but the only option he had it does the job provides the basic amenities but is sad to the touch dab dab sad but addictive every pale painted room echoed with memories of his momma and her mild mannered unfulfilled yearnings her perplexed unspoken disappointment lingers out with it momma do you want to know why i cast aside every decent thing to elope with that foreign religion you should have held firmer when i demanded you and dad send your permission to marry youd probably have appreciated an invite i heard you cried with layla id join you two right now maggoty cath was responsible for the scattering i had my guard down and she tunneled her way in ive been much too acquiescent with that fucking papilloma do you think if he stays calm in silhouette his dignity might return bless him hes not calm but frozen and hoping t rex doesnt notice its a long time since he showed any initiative after his interrogation world fed let him go speaking to the media hard faced and beating his chest he demanded to see the repository because he and only he could uncover the truth about layla word fed said yes absolutely anything that might help they broadcast the event live on the stream kooky discredited joel saw nothing world fed had summed him up and let him hang himself this is just bad luck i am an extraordinary person with exceptional skills why else did layla fall into my lap and when i grew beyond my obsession for the miraculous la parkin and then her company and then her bumps and juices i was called forth to haifa to sit on the house of justice the universal house of justice to direct the bahais in a cause even more important than laylas endeavours that the people on this earth would embrace bahaullah and usher in a wonderful new era of humanity that finally resonated to gods frequency thats the task i was entrusted with and god never asks of a person more than they can bear i cant keep it up somebody somewhere got it wrong very wrong gave me false hope i was a good prospect but was never meant to be a leader and i didnt get training now i have nothing here holed up in this house with that ungrateful wench shes not a patch on my layla in any sense i want her back but i cant because im too fucking useless to sort out that world fed mafia scatty cath holds me back fish face for such an incompetent idiot ive been up there with the best of them my election onto the universal house of justice was revolutionary i was one of the few people who had made it on to the supreme body through the elected national route and not via membership of a uhj appointed committee they all loved me yeah i joel had a mandate to bring my fresh layla smelling breath to bear wed tackle it from both sides id enthrall the world with the best spirituality and afterwards when layla had sorted out the heavy politics we would get together again and be feted that was my idea spikey headed cath had a free ride and milked it i spoke side saddle i capitulated to every idea articulated by enayati starting with the living arrangements somehow enayati got to handling them i never questioned why just an esteemed house member would be performing such a mundane function joel how many bedrooms do you need you dont have children right just you and catherine is it
9138315 if it wasnt for you layla id have been forced to make my own way and would have grown in my own way we can still be friends ill see you in the end
9138316 you know cath i look at carson and although i loathe his lies i admire his skill i think if only layla had met someone like him instead of me he wouldnt have treated her so badly and when push came to shove hed be able to do something to help her maybe the end does justify any means of getting there maybe you have to have those street smarts to get anything done enayati is like that too i never trusted him but he knew how to get his own way i tell ya i was so stoked when mcguire came on the scene he was an even better bullduster than carson i thought yeah hell do the dirty work clear the mine field and leave me with a clear run but these people play for keeps cath they probably have to to keep order
9138317 aw look joel you might be right there might be some hidden agenda but at their level its never as simple as a couple of people telling a few white lies to smooth over the wrinkles there has to be a culture of light whys too
9138318 yeah i think world fed isnt being held as accountable as it should be the media all wrap round them particularly in melbourne they are all buddies they rely on each other remember those repository scenes that were conveniently leaked to silence the rebel groups in china and germany
9138319 yeah but i would have gone with block aberrations were allowed to be imaginative catherine sees joels disdain but dont mind me im just joking ive always had a good sense of humour havent i love

9138325 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9138326 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9138327 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9138328 its been kind of my goal the last month or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9138329 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations

9138340 only somebody in the crowd thought i meant everybody and everybody went
9138341 but when i saw that exuberance when i saw that energy when i saw the passion and the fire get unleashed that had been dormant in this football team i got excited i got fired up
9138342 sarah palin is so hot if she went to san francisco the gay bars would all go out of business
9138343 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9138344 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9138345 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9138346 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9138347 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9138348 i feel bad for him he was very much in our plans
9138349 its just an unusual situation with the numbers at wide receiver with all the injuries holmgren said
9138350 i feel like i did what i was expected to do
9138351 there are always things you can improve on but my job today was just to make it difficult on them and i feel like i did that
9138352 it always comes down to the last preseason game and everyone shows up wallace said
9138353 the coaching staff has some big decisions ahead of them
9138354 mark is one of those what do you call them self realization guys

9138361 allah akan mengangkat kedudukan beberapa kaum dengan ini dan allah akan meletakkan merendahkan kedudukan sebagian yang lain
9138362 sikap sekarang terhadap sangat memprihatinkan seolah olah dibicarakan kepada mereka dari tempat yang yang sangat jauh dan sangat sulit menemukan orang yang benar benar berpegang teguh kepada ini adalah masalah besar yang tidak boleh dibiarkan berlarut begitu saja bila kita tidak menginginkan keterasingan dari agama dan dari keterasingan al quran sebagai pedoman hidup
9138363 maka apakah mereka tidak memperhatikan ataukah hati mereka yang terkunci
9138364 i say this when i speak to a group of bankers i think i know a little about banking but you all know that you know something about coaching
9138365 i think its special for everyone at csu and everyone at cu
9138366 this game has national recognition from coast to coast being played at invesco field at mile high people identify with this game
9138367 but he was on my little brothers team and i know hes got a big leg and is a good kicker
9138368 ive grown up with it plus my parents went to csu but theyre really big cu fans now
9138369 my brother and sister went here and his family has lived in boulder for 25 years ive grown up a cu fan the rivalry is always there its always been such a fun game to watch
9138370 d line is a good position for my body type hes 6 4 260 i actually was getting a little heavy for tight end a little heavy and slow
9138371 they pounded it on us pounded it theyve got two really good backs and a good o line so i would assume theyll emphasize the run coach fairchilds been around for a while so im sure hell definitely get that running game going
9138372 you try and take a little pressure off of him by running the ball you go with your strengths and obviously those are two proven guys
9138373 you stand out in our practice field and you watch all the guys yeah he moves differently than the rest of our guys
9138374 hes just one of those guys that has that knack
9138375 muliakanlah para ulama karena sesungguhnya mereka itu adalah ahli waris para nabi barangsiapa memuliakan mereka berarti telah memuliakan allah dan rasul nya
9138376 niscaya allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman diantaramu dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu pengetahuan beberapa derjat dan allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
9138377 i have confidence theyre going to emerge in time and be really good players
9138378 its fun to see the whole team play but its not like well i wonder how hes going to do i think we have a pretty good idea of how guys are going to do or you wouldnt expose them
9138379 fans and alums are not here at practice every day theyre not in the meetings we cant be governed by that weve been doing this for a lot of years we know if a kids ready to go
9138380 i know its real popular and easy to go yeah play em but youve got to do whats best for that kid if hes not ready to play meaningful downs youre doing him a disservice and ultimately your team a disservice
9138381 the guys say theres 70 000 people in the stadium drunk all wanting to see their team win
9138382 discipline its totally different from high school where you could get away with a couple of things but you actually have a coach now behind you looking at your every move and talking to you about it
9138383 my teammates have told me it was one of the biggest games of the year and theres no love for cu if we lose
9138384 i was rushing a lot of things i was harder on myself in trying to get used to playing at a college level now toward the end ive kind of calmed down now im just ready to play
9138385 its played in an nfl stadium on a sunday so its like an nfl game its pretty big its a fight for whos boss of colorado
9138386 im surprised i came this far at least on the depth chart
9138387 im pretty happy on that i guess im just surprised that im playing college football
9138388 ive grown up with it i know the history between the schools pretty well i know about the intensity
9138389 i havent really asked much about it but our coaches have told us these guys really want to beat you and theyll really get geared up for this game
9138390 its exciting but disappointing too because riar is someone we really need
9138391 hes a good player definitely the best tight end we have
9138392 kind of comes naturally ive always been pretty confident in my ability to catch the ball
9138393 ive heard its pretty intense and gets ugly at times they csu take it very seriously so im going in taking it seriously
9138394 has done pretty well we like where hes at but hes certainly not where we need him to be but hes working in that direction

9138506 i wanted to go out there and get better with this game
9138507 i wanted to go out there and really take advantage of this take advantage of those reps out there im one play away from starting ill go look at the film and get better from this
9138508 i was going to give him a move but once i saw him slow up i just kept running just turned on the burners
9138509 you can usually feel when a game is going slow or fast
9138510 they had pitching issues early so that held things up
9138511 but i just happened to run into one and it worked out
9138512 thats what im looking for at this point in the year
9138513 even with us getting ready for the playoffs the reality is were still developing
9138514 there are a lot of good ballplayers in there and some arent going to get to play every day
9138515 i will buy a jamba juice for every online bee reader if bobby jackson plays in more than 50 games this season
9138516 if he was playing in the middle he hickman would certainly be a lot better player too
9138517 its very important because we have a lot of young guys
9138518 theyre the only older guys we really have theyve kind of been through it they have to help the younger guys when their head gets down theyve got to be the ones to pick them up
9138519 all three of them have done a great job of kind of making the freshmen feel a part of the team
9138520 early on it could be a little bit of them having to bite the tongue a little bit
9138521 probably one of the best linebacking corps in the nation
9138522 we really think theyve got to be the leaders and the anchor behind our defense
9138523 cyrus is more serious mike hickman is pretty much both serious and a jokester
9138524 were funny like to play around we get serious when we need to be
9138525 nobody got hurt today a couple of guys had little things but if it were the regular season they could have kept playing
9138526 that was good to see and then get him out of there before anything happened to him
9138527 you see it every day in practice but when you see it out there in the game it looks great
9138528 youd wish one of those runs would pop just to see him in the real open field and the chance to really run away
9138529 just to see that breakaway speed that he has but well wait to see until the regular season
9138530 reece is very explosive with the ball and he made a great play on the touchdown there
9138531 i didnt get many plays today but i feel that on the plays that i had i did my best
9138532 im debating whether to go to sacramento to be with my girlfriend and my baby or just stay in oakland and weather the storm
9138533 pssst wanna take alex off our hands remember not only is he from san diego but he played well for you when you were my offensive coordinator a few years back
9138534 and the really good ones are a point better than they are bad alex needs to learn that
9138535 itll be sitting on the coffee table or the kitchen counter at our house and i think wow ive got a gold medal
9138536 what ill remember most was the medal ceremony looking at my teammates as the gold medal was put around my neck
9138537 i look forward to seeing tina and all my olympic teammates
9138538 its the type of experience that bonds you for life ill always have a special connection with those 11 players
9138539 we needed to come back and play we have six more games to focus on and our real concern is making the playoffs
9138540 houston wants to get in the playoffs just like us
9138541 our path is very difficult weve got to win at home

9138555 we had that play dialed up all week on that first touchdown pass
9138556 its what weve talked about all along were bringing back a lot of experience on offense and they did pretty good
9138557 that was the big thing we had a couple on offense that killed some drives and just too many on defense
9138558 we let them battle every time you take a snap out there its a good lesson

9138561 we know there were a lot of us advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9138562 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9138563 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9138564 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9138565 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9138566 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9138567 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9138568 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honour and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9138569 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9138570 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9138571 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil

9138575 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9138576 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9138577 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9138578 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9138579 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9138580 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9138581 he sees sarah gov palin as the future of the party
9138582 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9138583 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9138584 we are in the process of moving over 100 000 cots 200 000 blankets tens of thousands of comfort kits as well as ready to eat meals into these coastal states
9138585 and will be voting for sen mccain and this ticket
9138586 but because of security concerns thats all i can say
9138587 in 04 president bush came here because it was an important area and its just as important in 08
9138588 she is a quality individual she stands for the right things and is no nonsense
9138589 she is a young politician who has exceptional qualifications a good family life and she is pro life which balances mccains position
9138590 you have to have that balance it is important she balances the ticket
9138591 i think it is a wonderful opportunity she is somebody who has family values somebody who knows the difficulty of raising a family and of serving the public i think she will do an outstanding job
9138592 i thought wow what a choice for the republican party
9138593 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9138594 its only doubts that were counting on fingers broken long ago
9138595 more than a woman more than a woman to me
9138596 when the odds look good you gotta play the hand you see
9138597 sometimes doing your best is only half the work sometimes you have to do your best better than anyone else is doing theirs sugar

9138601 argentina es para nosotros peor que la inquisici n somos perseguidos injustamente
9138602 we started moving the ball the line was doing great the receivers were making some great catches
9138603 we fought hard on defense some guys made plays we just got wore down
9138604 they have some good sized kids but again we have to battle that with quickness play in the middle and lower the shoulders
9138605 if you play high against a big person its not going to go in your favor so we have to stress eyes lower and heads up
9138606 i thought i was down so bad but the play kept going
9138607 he stripped it from me and they never blew the whistle
9138608 i saw him stood up with the ball went for it and took it
9138609 they were opening up the biggest holes ive seen ever they paved the way
9138610 we had a chip on our shoulder we always need to prove to people we can do it
9138611 im always hardest on them but i felt they played well
9138612 its my party and ill die if i want to
9138613 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
9138614 in harmony with nature ii photos by donald m robinson
9138615 once again the operation proved to be a success and is a clear demonstration of the good working relationship between the police and staff at alton towers
9138616 the operation will continue and i am sure that it will yield similar good results
9138617 gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
9138618 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9138619 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9138620 i have found the right partner to fight those who put their privilege ahead of their responsibility power ahead of principle
9138621 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9138622 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9138623 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team her inexperience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9138624 proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9138625 yet another encouraging sign that the old barriers are falling in our politics
9138626 gov palin has more executive experience than sen obama sen biden and sen schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9138627 when you look at a candidate you should ask two questions what have you done and what have you run
9138628 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pennsylvania are going through
9138629 we think that pennsylvanias demographics fit mccains candidacy much better than they fit obamas
9138630 he seemed to come out of nowhere one day hes nobody the next hes on oprah
9138631 the state of our economy is so awful and the republicans got us here
9138632 its about time for a change sooner or later its going to happen
9138633 i like that she is pro life and like me she has a child with disabilities
9138634 but she is so young and she doesnt have much experience
9138635 all i want for whats left of my life is to spend a month or two with my family in freedom
9138636 i accepted the fact that i have paranoid schizophrenia and as far as im concerned its no longer a factor im not a risk because im on the medication its a horrible thing that happened i wouldnt want anything like that to ever happen again
9138637 mark my words he will reoffend regardless of how sick he says he is i pity the woman who gets in his path
9138638 i havent seen such terror in my eyes ever before
9138639 are particularly afraid that a terminally ill mr weldon would have little to lose and therefore little disincentive to potentially harm them

9138652 ich selbst sah mich damals als sieger jetzt bin ich in deutschland um mir den titel wiederzuholen
9138653 am samstag werden sich die beiden besten schwergewichtler der welt im ring zeigen doch dieses mal wird der ausgang des kampfes anders sein als 2005 john ruiz wird weltmeister
9138654 die augen der welt werden auf berlin gerichtet sein wir k nnen eine menge erwarten

9138660 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9138661 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9138662 while this is an unfortunate situation we believe our response has been entirely appropriate
9138663 is getting a taste of what the rest of us have to deal with all the time

9138924 theres no question that its a unique experience to play an instrument of that age you get an appreciation for a certain kind of sonic environment with these instruments
9138925 theyre very intimate and the sound is very specific youre really listening more attentively than you would ordinarily
9138926 these are made for another time and its a whole other aesthetic in terms of sound its not aggressive in any way it reflects more of an interior life
9138927 its an important touchstone for people to see the history of humankind as reflected in these instruments and the care which was given for what purpose to create beauty
9138928 its also a signal in the community that these things are to be treasured you have a man who went through a great deal of trouble to collect these wonderful things to make it possible for torontonians to enjoy them and to see them
9138929 the water just poured down the walls of my office everything had been covered in linoleum and painted yellow there were neon lights plumbing on the walls
9138930 in some ways id have to say the state of the building reflected the state of the conservatory
9138931 i had always been frustrated by the marginalization or the categorization of the arts as purely a noble endeavour
9138932 just come home sit down for 15 minutes and have that tranquillity and repose and that dialogue with the inner self that would be an extraordinary dream to achieve
9138933 hes redefined music as an intellectual gymnasium where you go and get a workout for your head
9138934 hes really emphasizing music as a pleasure and a discipline but also as an exercise
9138935 the aspiration he has is that the conservatory is a player on the world stage so its seen to be in the same league as juilliard for example
9138936 the building has been built and its going to have a lovely design what it now needs is programs and training that match that architectural vision and were all waiting expectantly to see how thats fulfilled
9138937 were probably at the forefront of organizations now in making these neuroscience findings into practical programs that achieve quantifiable benefits

9138965 over the last few years particularly in asia we have seen just how deadly the h5n1 virus can be
9138966 so far we have been relatively fortunate and there has been only limited evidence of the virus transmitting from human to human the more we understand about the virus how it interacts with the body the better we will be prepared for any serious mutations that may arise
9138967 if the bird flu virus evolves to favour the receptors in our nose and throat like normal flu the results could be devastating
9138968 we could have a virus which is not only highly infectious but is easily transmissible by coughing and sneezing
9138969 if we can find out which mutations of haemagglutinin prefer which receptors we may be able to identify quickly or even predict which mutations give the virus pandemic potential
9138970 targeting the viruss ability to bind to the receptors which until now has proved far more difficult may provide an alternative more effective way of preventing infection
9138971 we hope that our work will make this process simpler and faster
9138972 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9138973 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9138974 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9138975 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9138976 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9138977 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9138978 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty

9138984 i dont think it was racing if anything it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it

9139018 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9139019 people always want to rush to say hes an addict people have called this character a sex addict and to me thats weird its been written that you can be a sex addict within a marriage
9139020 it was a turning point in my life a conjunction of timing maturity luck and attraction all the pieces fell into place when youre married you have to deal with yourself you cant sublimate your pain with drugs and other women or should that be women and other drugs
9139021 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9139022 the money helps pay for all our programs and not just football
9139023 it becomes difficult to match dates locations and all of those things and a lot of them are competitive

9139025 secondly if you look across the country most of the i a schools are playing i aa teams we think its fine
9139026 i dont think theres any question that its the 85
9139027 im looking forward to seeing a lot of people i havent seen in a long time
9139028 but on that saturday ill be wearing my teal and black i wont be wearing my blue and white
9139029 i dont think its anything to be alarmed about if you want to say its something youre looking at to improve yeah youre looking to improve it but as far as being alarmed these guys have done it
9139030 but look back and see what theyve done over the course of the season were not in this position if they havent done what theyve done both of them have been pretty damn good you want to throw daggers at these guys why theyve been phenomenal
9139031 he said he had enough so what can you do
9139032 im not going to send a guy out there that says hes done
9139033 once you get to 105 110 pitches youre pushing the envelope especially this late in the season obviously im leading the league in innings my body definitely has taken a toll if i was maybe around the 98 to 104 mark i possibly could have gone out but just after that last inning that was a 20 pitch inning i believe it took a toll

9139051 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9139052 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9139053 there are a couple of other decisions that wont be easy but thats a good thing
9139054 i told the guys the first day of camp that they need to make it as hard on tom and i as they possibly can
9139055 there are some spots here that are tough calls but well make the right ones
9139056 i feel my transition from pass rushing in college to the nfl has to get better
9139057 the tackles are a lot better than what i was used to in college i need to progress on getting better there
9139058 ive tried to work on the transition to the run but ive got to continue to get better playing this defense because the pass rush is a big part of this defense
9139059 i just went out there and played now it plays out with the coaches it was nice to go out and finish and play hard through a whole game the way i wanted to go
9139060 coming off the injury i think i did pretty good this game gave me confidence that i can stop the run there are still things i can do better it gave some confidence that i can play in the nfl
9139061 the coaches have decisions to make all around the board not just me
9139062 i put it in gods hands i played hard and let it all out on the field that has been my whole attitude throughout training camp leave it on the field continue to strive to get better
9139063 through my relationship with jesus christ i just stopped worrying about a lot of things
9139064 a lot of times young guys come into the league and are real tentative worrying about messing up they put a lot of things on their shoulders
9139065 its hard for them not to do that people expect so much out of you its good when you can turn it over to god and go out and play
9139066 the area that needs to improve is in the pass game and hes been working very hard on that
9139067 we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better
9139068 if im making the plays i am supposed to i would be in the right spot
9139069 i think i could have done more could have done better overall i came out and made a couple of tackles and made a couple of plays im hoping that overrides everything else
9139070 if you dont know what you are doing on defense you got to make plays not that i didnt know what i was doing but there were times when i was in the wrong spot but i was still trying to make plays any way i could that shows up on film
9139071 want it to be a celebration of the spectrum for the fans who made it what it is and give it the respect it deserves
9139072 he says that every week its the snack after the meeting there are other things you can eat but the cheeseburgers are always on the menu
9139073 i give my little talk and then i always finish it with ill treat you to a cheeseburger
9139074 there was a game during my third or fourth year when i didnt say it and all the players just sat there and kind of looked at me then they said hey hey you didnt say anything about the cheeseburger now i make sure i say it every time
9139075 heres all you need to know with a coach that looks like me youre going to eat good if nothing else youre going to eat good both home and away
9139076 me being a big guy i try to stay away from them
9139077 theyre pretty good though big sirloin burgers and i do love them
9139078 its just a walk through and youre pretty much looking to leave the building as soon as you get to the building because you know youre going to be gone by 11 in the morning at that point youre just looking forward to sunday
9139079 if i know somebody i like to watch those games
9139080 i know jim harbaugh so i watch stanford and i know charlie weis so maybe ill watch notre dame if i know a coach ill be more interested sometimes i fall asleep
9139081 for the quarterbacks we take a sort of test about the game plan then the team gets together and andy speaks hopefully you won the previous week because you get a highlight tape then you get a snack and you go to bed
9139082 we get a good review of our opponent and then we put in the first 15 plays
9139083 i laugh and joke with him at snack but he doesnt talk to me much that day
9139084 we talk more than enough during the week i think we run out of things to say on saturday the other thing i do on saturday is call home and give my good nights and i love yous i talk to my daughter before i go to bed
9139085 i like to keep things as consistent for the players as i can
9139086 i want to let them have a place that they can get away with mom and dad uncle charlie and everybody else coming over they can get to the hotel and focus on their job
9139087 i realize that nobody but the player understands what its like to be a player all those people love them but they look at this as a game and for the players this is a business i want them to get off their feet you dont want to peak too soon the whole week youre trying to perfect your peak
9139088 sometimes during the week im doing a few different things and i use saturday to go through it just one more time
9139089 i put the college games on ive got my projector where i go through all my film and i just start going back through things
9139090 ill also sneak home that day especially if one of the kids has a game my wife goes on the road with me
9139091 the thing i remember most about that day is reggie brown having a good game with a long run you dont like that stuff but that one doesnt stick out as being that big of a thing
9139092 i think i went out and did what they wanted me to do showed them i can play football and make plays im just waiting to see if i make the team or not
9139093 i think that was the most important tackle i had all night
9139094 they know what i can do on defense but i wanted to come out and show them what i can do on special teams by going out and making tackles
9139095 i knew special teams were going to be very important for me thats what makes and breaks players if you can play special teams or not more than anything i was trying to put more of an emphasis on special teams than defense but as it turned out it seemed like i put more emphasis on defense
9139096 hes taken what he did in college and transformed it to this camp
9139097 the area where he needs to improve is in the passing game hes been working very hard at that we knew that would be a challenge for him but hes getting better at it it wouldve been nice to see him tip that ball down in the end zone a 6 yard touchdown pass from erik ainge to david ball that went over mays head hell learn from that the next time hell be a foot deeper and jump an inch higher and be in the right position to make that play
9139098 pass coverage was something i needed to work on in college
9139099 once i got here they put a big emphasis on it i just worked my butt off week and week out and am starting to get better at it
9139100 we played a tampa 2 scheme in college which is a little similar to what jim johnson has here
9139101 i just carried over some of the verbiage that we used and just try to connect it with some of the things jim johnson does here it worked out for me a little bit im just glad i was able to learn that kind of stuff in college its helped me out here
9139102 after the second preseason game against carolina everything started to click i started to feel more comfortable out there i was thinking less and just trying to make plays
9139103 im used to moving around being at practice or playing the game now ive got to just sit around and wait and see if i made the team or not
9139104 i know i came out and put all my heart into it
9139105 well just have to wait and see what happens im upbeat about things and waiting for the next chapter in my life
9139106 tv dig terminator the sarah connor chronicles su steel sci fi
9139107 whether it was a house a garage you want to get something knocked down you call carl g thats the name of his company
9139108 that was hard work real hard i was thinking when it started how am i gonna do
9139109 it was difficult at first once i got the hang of it i was fine it came natural swinging that sledgehammer definitely made me stronger
9139110 i didnt know how id be able to do it
9139111 im a little short and light for this line stuff got roughed up a little in the scrimmages it was confusing for real just had to buckle down and show that heart i just try to find the holes and burst through them
9139112 i was looking to run down and make a hard hit then i saw it was exciting to see faison perry recover it
9139113 i was asking quarterback al hajj shabazz to give me the ball not up to him though i dont mind blocking just get to that destination and hope our halfbacks right behind me
9139114 all im trying to do is get these guys to focus on the process that means attacking executing and finishing every play
9139115 its the first time that ive been here that weve produced in all three phases last years team was a selfish team they were a bunch of prima donnas thats the difference this years team is less selfish
9139116 this is something different this is something ive never felt before
9139117 weve never won a season opener coach golden has never won its just different we still have a ways to go
9139118 i think the biggest thing that im proud of is that we came out and eliminated some of the mistakes we made last year we still have some work to do on offense and special teams but its still big for us were going to enjoy this for a few days and then get ready for next week
9139119 i have all the confidence in the bullpen and i knew i wouldnt have been able to get the job done either
9139120 complete games are great and all that but the complete games i threw even early in the season they took a toll on me i wasnt up to par two starts down the line so i dont want that to affect me especially this late in the season when every 5 days i go out and every game means something and ive got to be able to put in six seven eight quality innings where i can give the team an opportunity
9139121 theyre not going to do that a calls a call
9139122 i dont think ive ever walked five batters in a game
9139123 weve done what weve tried to do and get their starters out
9139124 it changes the outcome of the game it changes the momentum instead of them being down 3 2 they get out of the inning and soriano hits a home run and now they are up 3 2
9139125 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9139126 im really up in the air i like both sports a lot i guess itll come down to which sport gives me the chance for the most money and the best education
9139127 in lacrosse were coming off a state championship so that sports a pretty big deal at la salle and very enjoyable
9139128 i wouldnt say it was that nice of a punt
9139129 they told me to line up as the shotgun quarterback and just get rid of it i was close to the line so i had to hurry it got a good roll and connor hoffman did a great job of downing it at about the 1 inch line
9139130 from brian it was running back play and from kevin it was how to play defense well really i learned most of the football stuff from my dad bill who coached me at st matts in mayfair
9139131 though i didnt play defense tonight im told theyll be mixing me in later this season probably at cornerback where i played last year
9139132 every guy can run or go out for passes you can line up anywhere
9139133 i mostly made my catches on fullback waggle plays where i wound up out in the flat i didnt show much more than running before but i want to be more than a runner it feels awesome to show versatility
9139134 being a news camera man im on my feet constantly we have about 50 pounds of gear that were constantly carrying
9139135 i have to pick up a camera sometimes off the ground carry a tripod in the other arm moving around sometimes walking backwards to get a shot

9139137 the acl is the anterior crucia ligament its a ligament that connects the tibia to the femur it provides anterior translation to the knee and so if someone tears their acl they lose that stability to the knee
9139138 work on getting the mobility back work on strengthening the knee and the areas and muscles around the knee so that after the surgery the rehab will go better
9139139 im not scared of it im anxious now i just want to have the surgery get it done with and get back to my daily life
9139140 we realized we needed a new facility even before the hurricane hit so this gave us the opportunity to get that

9139144 confidence in the mobile initiative has led them to continue on a do it ourselves strategy
9139145 thats the one glimmering sign of hope the subscription music model has hit a brick wall
9139146 its certainly no surprise that the current board and management are defending themselves so vigorously they are defending their entrenched positions

9139149 this gripping beautifully reported book lays bare the tumult of hope fear and skullduggery that exists behind the ubiquitous
9139150 harney has given us an almost forensic field guide to the strikingly low cost of labor intensive goods manufacturing in china by systematically sifting through the factors that cheapen the production process she has denied us the luxury of uncertainty some may find the ethics and inevitability of chinese production conditions debatable but no business person involved in global sourcing will be credible claiming ignorance of the basic facts in light of harneys work
9139151 the gritty corrupt reality of the chinese economic miracle is the great business story of our time and alexandra harney has got it she has explored the factories dormitories and urban slums to reveal the devastating cost to the planet to american workers and to chinese citizens of the china price
9139152 with unusual insight and reportorial perseverance alexandra harney presents the inconvenient truths about china and globalization that flat worlders have overlooked this book is very important and is a must read for those who want to understand how todays world really works

9139158 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9139159 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9139160 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9139161 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9139162 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9139163 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9139164 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9139165 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9139166 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9139167 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9139168 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9139169 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9139170 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9139171 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9139172 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9139173 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9139174 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9139175 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9139176 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9139177 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9139178 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9139179 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9139205 the last couple weeks i havent been feeling that great at the plate so i just tried to go back to basics i guess
9139206 go up the middle and it seemed to work out for me
9139207 over the last couple weeks i think weve been pressing a little bit to score some runs and our pitchers have been doing a great job especially on this road trip of giving us a chance to win
9139208 sometimes you try too hard and come up a little short im glad we had a little bit of a breakout game
9139209 its nice to have one under my belt if i never get another one but more importantly to be able to eat up some innings and save the back end of the bullpen for saturday

9139217 academics tend to err on the side of nuance and precision eschewing generalizations and coarse labels this is great for documenting cultural dynamics but not so great for making interventions
9139218 psychologists and neuroscientists have recently become fascinated by the human predilection for storytelling why does our brain seem to be wired to enjoy stories and how do the emotional and cognitive effects of a narrative influence our beliefs and real world decisions
9139219 whatever happened to performance support whatever happened to performance support he explores the roots of performance support its rapid rise and then apparent disappearance its a good quick read into one of the concepts within training and development that holds much promise and on the surface at least appears to have failed to reach its potential earlier this week i had the pleasure of being interviewed by robin good of the video of our discussion is now available the conversation was somewhat diverse in topics ranging from learning trends and the role of schools robin asked a series of excellent questions on the role of schools at the secondary level that i did a particularly poor job of addressing coherently but i enjoyed the conversation robins passion and energy come through very clearly in the interview to learn more about george siemens and to access extensive information and resources on elearning check out knowing knowledge

9139222 at the beginning of the 21st century in italy where is known as connettivismo it originated in italian
9139223 there was a lot of time and energy spent on this proposal
9139224 you learn a lot of different ways but for me the best way to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9139225 i think troy and kyle have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
9139226 we didnt know what they were going to do on offense and defense it was different from their approach last year it was the first time since ive been here that we produced in all three phases
9139227 it was a slant where you take two steps and run to the pylon
9139228 it was just a matter of faking out the defense it just came open
9139229 getting the ball down deep in armys territory from there its simple
9139230 the defense put us in a good position bruce made a good play and maneri ran a good route
9139231 i was just doing my job and doing what the coaches told me to do
9139232 we work on scoop and score every day its second nature
9139233 theyre an established program and we had something to prove
9139234 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9139235 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9139236 theyre in the hov lane for 90 plus victories and a fourth division title in the past five years
9139237 the angels have a habit of acing the compulsories but falling off the balance beam during the postseason program
9139238 as far as missed opportunities i guess you could say that
9139239 thats kind of how the inning started it was me not coming at them
9139240 i could live with myself better if i gave up five hits in an inning than walking the bases loaded to get them into a situation where they can do some damage
9139241 this is the time of the year when you have to step it up
9139242 weve got a month left of important games and i like where were at as a team
9139243 i like where the bullpens at i like the way our starters are throwing the ball i like the way were scoring runs we have to stay healthy this last month
9139244 what we have now is he has some calcification that has built up in the elbow around the ligament area it has been common for pitchers who have had tommy john surgery where calcification will build up
9139245 we have got jobs here because of the nano project now the agitation has put a question mark not only on the project but also on our jobs will the agitators provide us employment if the factory is forced to shut down
9139246 we are locals and have got the right to stay and work here strangely outsiders have raided the area and are driving us away from our workplace we are being threatened with dire consequences if we venture near the factory gates this is unfair
9139247 none of our employees attended work we are assessing the situation
9139248 unfortunately we have become pawns in the hands of politicians who are out to extract political mileage from the issue they have no sympathy either for the farmers or for us but in the bargain we are going to lose out
9139249 the movement will continue but we are not stopping anybody from entering the factory

9139252 the dirty bomb wouldve contained 500 pounds of highly radioactive sand which would have been spread around by the bomb detonating approximately 10 thousand feet above the city the japanese scientists then committed suicide using cyanide capsules they managed to conceal
9139253 i think it wouldnt be that hard to make a submersible carrier considering the size of ballistic missile subs but as mentioned earlier carrying tomahawks is just as good as carrying actual planes
9139254 great story i have heard of balloon drops of incendary devices in washington and oregon but not this attack
9139255 its actually more about the submarines you could replace all the referances to aircraft with flying purple hippos and the article wouldnt lose much
9139256 if a tomahawk missile is a plane then you might argue that a v2 balistic missile is a plane as well germany fired those from trucks so they couldnt have been too far away from firing them from u boats as well bang then they might have rained down in places other than london
9139257 yes they not only could have been too far away they were too far away from firing those from u boats
9139258 is this kind of national hatred and stupid narrow minded insolence acceptable and common on this site
9139259 yes they not only could have been too far away they were too far away from firing those from u boats
9139260 i think you might want to read the following article
9139261 the amount of supplies needed for a single launch for one of those exceeds by several magnitudes the capacities of a wwii german u boat
9139262 problem is it would be really impractical and slow sub for a hanger to go in it
9139263 i know this is kind of off topic but this talk of attacks on the north american continent got me thinking didnt the germans have plans for a really big supersonic bomber with a range that would have made reaching new york and possibly returning possible
9139264 during world war i germany had plans to build a massive airship that would cross the atlantic and bomb new york it was only partially built by the time the war ended the french ended up with it named it the dixmude and shortly thereafter lost it in a storm over the mediterranean
9139265 it sat nestled inside its tiny sealed cocoon with its delicate wings folded
9139266 but you would have to stop and fill up with water as well as gas
9139267 i remember reading some article about instead of adding a spare cylinder to the engine to use water in the existing cylinders instead of the usual two up and down movements fill up with fuel in the first one combustion power in the second one you would simply add a third stroke to it where water is injected evaporates due to the heat and thus produces a second steam power stroke in the engine not only would this provide extra power from the engine without using up extra fuel but it would also cool the engine in the process
9139268 what a shame this isnt the current technology that we are using today instead of the horrible carbon spewing machines we drive everywhere in still here in australia there is a massive water shortage we are on stage 3 water restrictions meaning no watering a garden or grass and no washing of cars so it might not be the perfect way although if the water is released as steam then it would rise into the atmsphere and come down as rain right correct me if im wrong
9139269 to those engineering minded among you is there any good reason why these would not be suitable for use today they sound very clean and efficient from what alan has described
9139270 that is true but most people trade in their car after 3 4 years however the dealer would then have to replace the batteries anyway so you might not get very much on trade in but i dont know what percentage of the cost of the car is in batteries
9139271 is it just me or do other people get just a little frustrated at the fact we have the capability to produce highly efficient electric steam vehicles and yet the government is sitting on their collective hands because
9139272 you want an electric car because its pollution free no you just moved the point of pollution to another location whether the energy is produced from fossil fuels or natural gas because of combustion by products
9139273 however generally munincipal power plants are a good deal more efficient then internal combustion engines meaning less net pollution per mile driven not to mention you can get solar chargers for those cars
9139274 if i havent thought of it yet it likely is not possible
9139275 does anyone think this is a hoax invisibility cloaks if i were invisible id totally freak out my roommates
9139276 how do we know they havent perfected invisibility after all how would we know
9139277 sir john and his team created a five inch round cloak using a metamaterial structured in two dimensional concentric rings specifically designed for this purpose
9139278 does anyone think this is a hoax invisibility cloaks if i were invisible id totally freak out my roommates
9139279 naturally the military has expressed interest in the budding technology as well as proving funding for its development
9139280 now this is just too cool would one of yall please explain to this silly old gal in simple language if possible how stealth craft are invisible
9139281 the picture showing someone wearing a cloak in japan is not a hoax
9139282 otherwise we would have a pair of disembodied free floating eyes which in anybodies book is pretty cool
9139283 has anyone else heard of jasper maskelyne he was a stage magician during wwii who worked for the british army deployed in the western desert he was apparently able to hide the suez canal from german bombers using optical illusions
9139284 interestedone needs to remember his security briefings and his non disclosure statemates before the men in black come to see him grin
9139285 in describing wells character and his visible food problem there is an even trickier problem if his corneas are invisible he would be blind otherwise we would have a pair of disembodied free floating eyes which in anybodys book is pretty cool
9139286 i think since the invisiblity discribed here is not really transparency but a way to move light completely around an object if say a man was cloaked head to toe except for his eyeballs you could see the surface of the eyes from the front but nothing from the back further it would just be the surface and not the bulk of the eye ball it would appear 2 dimentional i think that this would be very hard to detect and could be easily hid or camoflauged
9139287 physics of wave propagation in miniaturized metamaterial based waveguides analytical numerical and experimental investigation
9139288 wow im amased that these stuff is really interesting to the wide population
9139289 physics of wave propagation in miniaturized metamaterial based waveguides analytical numerical and experimental investigation
9139290 seems like a simpler approach would be to use fiber optics simply project the image of whats behind an object through the fibers ending at the surface of the object voila its invisible
9139291 having read many if these comments in the past i realize there are many intelligent people commenting on this site
9139292 the japanese guy in the raincoat is nothing more than front projection a cinema fx technique that has been around for many decades
9139293 with all due respect i do not think our crispi was trying to insult you or your lack of intelligence
9139294 does anyone think this is a hoax invisibility cloaks if i were invisible id totally freak out my roommates
9139295 these videos are quite obviously fakes the guy has been superimposed over the top of the video of moving traffic using blue screen technology replacing the colour of the jacket with that of the video some subtle video effect are used to colour adjust them a bit
9139296 it depends if it is just one display which projects the image from the camera on the backside then its a bit fishy but if you have the processing unit which processes each pixel and if you have a separate display for each pixel or each piece of picture not necessarily as small as one pixel and if processing unit is able to calculate phase amplitude and frequency offset according to the curvature of the coat then it might be possible that the video isnt fake
9139297 i especially dont consider that knowledge of more than one language is anything special
9139298 we have a winner floj you win an invisible pie tin so everyone can more fully appreciate the beauty of pie
9139299 dude if you cant take a joke its not my fault dont get your shorts in a bunch on my account please forgive my sarcastic sense of humor
9139300 hmmm does anyone else find it hard to believe that waxy whale goo would have a pleasant odour
9139301 if i was invisible i hide in the girls change rooms d
9139302 a waxy grayish substance formed in the intestines of sperm whales and found floating at sea or washed ashore it is added to perfumes to slow down the rate of evaporation
9139303 not that it will help explain the use of ambergris by the author but try this site stephen r donaldson ate my dictionary meeting the big scary words of stephen r donaldsons chronicles of thomas covenant
9139304 yes ive been reading about these materials alot it so cool i read that these materials use nano sized lc circuits that are capable of transmiting light
9139305 we the public venture to suggest that you very kindly take trouble to come to this place and shoot this tiger and save the public from this calamity for this act of kindness the public will be highly obliged and will pray for your long life and prosperity
9139306 the stress of circumstances is in nine cases out of ten wounds and in the tenth case old age
9139307 human beings are not the natural prey of tigers and it is only when tigers have been incapacitated through wounds or old age that in order to survive they are compelled to take to a diet of human flesh
9139308 can have no conception of the grace of movement and beauty of colouring of this the most graceful and the most beautiful in our indian jungles nor are his attractions limited to outward appearances for pound for pound his strength is second to none and in courage he lacks nothing
9139309 days when there were ten tigers to every one that now survives
9139310 i had heard of his hunt of the champawat tiger which from the pictures in national geographic c 1910 was a ligress a lion tiger crossbreed that grows to nearly double normal tiger size
9139311 humanity is garbage plain and simple this man corbett is an example we all should follow
9139312 was the movie the ghost in the darkness based on this guy in the movie it was a bridge builder lt col john patterson must be different same time and place though great movie great article
9139313 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth on every bird of the air on all that move on the earth and on all the fish of the sea they are given into your hand
9139314 if anyone is interested i found a free full text version of maneaters of kumaon here may 2nd 2008 8 43 am
9139315 sorry about the size of the post my students think i get long winded too
9139316 no need to apologize for the size of the post but im not sure why you thought hunting was illegal in southern illinois i know several people who hunt there regularly especially deer cant use centerfire rifles but shotgun muzzleloader and archery hunting of deer is very popular there handgun hunting too i believe
9139317 deer dove pheasant squirrell quail rabbit turtle duck goose and just about anything else that had a hunting season
9139318 are there any corbetts out there stalking killer plants for the good of innocent civillians
9139319 radiatidon wow youre twice lucky first for seeing the tiger second for living to tell about it
9139320 how relative and subjective is everything in our conception of the world often young educated people living in big cities tend to feel respect and admiration for wildlife commonly nevertheless young uneducated people living in small towns rural areas and jungles tend to look at everything that moves on all fourths as nothing else than food
9139321 the animal was dangerous and why do they foolishly allowed it to run loose in the national park
9139322 on other sense poverty often comes by the hand of ignorance this last dressed of disregard for life and justice
9139323 you speak of circumstances and things of which you know nothing your ignorance and generalization sicken me i hate it when people theorize why people are poverty stricken have you ever been homeless have you ever gone hungry have you ever seriously wondered when the next time you were going to eat was going to be my guess is no you probably havent i have dont believe ignorance is the only or even the most common cause of poverty for that is true ignorance
9139324 thanks for your insults they only provide me additional reasons to think i am in the correct path towards truth
9139325 tutto dipende da quali siano i reali progetti un modesto ridimensionamento a fronte di un incremento di malpensa pu essere accettabile in quella logica di migliore ripartizione dei voli da pi parti auspicata oltre un anno fa avevamo segnalato ufficialmente al governo la disponibilit a riconsiderare uno spostamento di voli tra linate e malpensa ma bisogna valutare in che misura sia fattibile
9139326 linate un aeroporto strategico e di grande importanza per milano e il suo destino non pu essere legato a quello di alitalia la stragrande maggioranza delle piccole e medie imprese milanesi ritiene linate un city airport irrinunciabile proprio perch incorporato nel cuore della citt e dunque di facile accessibilit in previsione di expo 2015 non ha senso privarsi della struttura che funziona bene e deve essere semmai potenziata
9139327 che rischiano di essere danneggiati dal momento che si cancella di fatto la concorrenza sulla tratta milano roma devono essere applicate tariffe europee
9139328 quella di usare linate come navetta pi snella sulla tratta milano roma una vecchia tesi dettata esclusivamente da una fredda analisi razionale chiaro che questo comporter disagi ai quali si potr ovviare intervenendo sulle infrastrutture di collegamento con malpensa
9139329 la colpa del vecchio forlanini di cannibalizzare malpensa o meglio di cannibalizzare alitalia costretta a scegliere fra raddoppiare gli aerei sulla stessa destinazione milano o perdere passeggeri a favore di compagnie straniere che utilizzano linate per alimentare hub allestero sulle rotte intercontinentali per intenderci in assenza di un collegamento diretto pu essere pi conveniente partire da linate per poi fare scalo a parigi air france piuttosto che a londra british o francoforte lufthansa linate forse potr ritagliarsi un ruolo come aeroporto per i soli voli nazionali
9139330 linsediamento di un casin nellambito della villa reale di monza potrebbe rivelarsi di importanza strategica anche ai fini di un potenziamento di malpensa da un lato e del mantenimento a linate dellattuale livello di voli senza dover pensare a ridimensionamenti di sorta come sembra ventilarsi daltro lato
9139331 anche esternamente la situazione migliorata e non un caso che tre dei sedici gravi episodi di violenza sessuale accaduti negli ultimi quattro mesi a milano proprio nellarea della centrale e per la precisione lotto il dodici aprile e il 15 maggio scorso abbiano avuto i rispettivi responsabili arrestati in flagranza di reato non ultimo limpiego di militari nei pattugliamenti ha contribuito a dare ulteriori garanzie e si aggiunge ai presidi di vigili security point e forze dellordine
9139332 the irony but it seems she has unwittingly done just that you
9139333 he went in to the last race with a few issues
9139334 we thought he was fit enough and he ran well the other day
9139335 the grey horse light fantastic took the short cut and we went around the turn like an old chook
9139336 i said before the race that he was either here to play today
9139337 well i havent had a winner today but im still smiling
9139338 he will go to the valley for the dato tan chin nam stakes and then probably back for the underwood we will make a further decision after that
9139339 i would have been delighted if he was running home for fourth but how he finished and found the line at the finish was a credit to the horse
9139340 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9139341 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9139342 i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9139343 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9139344 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9139345 talking to reporters is a brand new ball game for me
9139346 at the kentucky derby my wife called me the media darling
9139347 i just ate up every bit of it it was an experience that i gave up on 30 years ago i didnt think id ever have a horse like this mainly because of where i train ive been at calder since day one 1971
9139348 the truth is i was never offered a big job im not stupid i would have taken a big job and gone to new york or kentucky or anywhere im just very grateful and thankful to have a horse like this
9139349 at the top of the stretch we thought he was going to win it
9139350 i thought there were two races one for big brown i won the second race by 7 1 2 lengths
9139351 i went from being crazy mad to cussin to crying like a baby
9139352 its a wonderful experience to have a little horse like this
9139353 hes taken us to four different race tracks its the experience of a lifetime
9139354 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city

9139360 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time economic environmental development shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
9139361 our economic environmental development research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
9139362 and as a result finding key economic environmental development market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
9139363 weve been working on this economic environmental development project for 8 months now
9139364 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
9139365 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
9139366 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
9139367 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
9139368 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important economic environmental development human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
9139369 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future
9139370 a rose by any other name would smell as sweet

9139387 i did say a bad word which would get me thrown out
9139388 it was fun but i really didnt work that much on defense during the week
9139389 earlier in camp we went over some defensive options and i just remembered what to do
9139390 it was different playing the position but mostly i used my athletic ability to cover the receivers
9139391 they the officers then turned right into a a side street they searched the back of the side street and came back onto bridge rd where they located the two vehicles that had collided

9139395 he reported to the king on the current situation and he will return to bangkok today
9139396 i want to go home i have nothing to do with this situation one frustrated australian man said
9139397 we will not quit we will not go home until we win
9139398 im very fortunate that i didnt get caught up in it it was great to stand next to tony kanaan on the podium first and second hopefully we can do something similar again
9139399 its been a year of ups and downs and drama
9139400 its either been something on the track drawing attention or something off the track
9139401 when the secondary explosion occurred at the reactor spewing an almost immeasurable torrent of radioactivity into the jet stream surrounding locales could only survive long enough to form mass graves for their dead
9139402 towering hulks of reshaped and animated flesh are a common sight in the northern steppes once terrifying siege engines employed in the horizon upheavals a prolonged spate of peace has seen them decommissioned and adapted to cultural rituals this specific necrotic collossus is actually functioning as a nomadic funeral temple a site of excarnation that can follow tribes in their caravans the collossus once directed by a whip cracking beast master is now only directed by two weary oxen
9139403 stealing the internet a routed wide area man in the middle attack
9139404 this is a little bit of a rapid ascent but i think we all feel our development people especially that bowden can han dle whatever comes at him its an exciting day for the organization
9139405 i dont think that just reaching that number in and of itself has that much meaning
9139406 he threw more strikes today hes always throwing high counts but today he threw strikes and we were flailing for it
9139407 i thought he was throwing his fastball in to righthanded hitters very aggressively and for strikes which opened up the plate and i thought his slider was also effective
9139408 those two pitches were real strong he looked strong its getting to the point in the season where were heading into september and he seems to have a lot left in the tank which is good news
9139409 with the tough loss thursday in new york and the team we might face again in the near future i wanted to go out there and pitch a good game
9139410 i did hold the white sox in my last start against them but i didnt feel like i was really pushing or pitching against them that forcefully which i was able to do today and i was happy about that
9139411 these past two or three games i have been pitching inconsistently and i think i mentioned this the last time but those games were the period where my fatigue peaked in the season i dont quite think i got over it today and i think ill take another start to see how i feel but what id like to do is learn from my mistakes last season and be able to pitch healthy all the way to the end
9139412 instead of thinking of mediums as separate entities i really find the common ground in all mediums
9139413 we shoot the tv show at 6 30 in the morning until 7 or 8 at night and then i gotta be at the restaurants
9139414 it was in my blood to become a chef its part of my lifeline
9139415 because of that i realize if im making a song or a menu item i go through the exact same thought process what does this song need it needs tension and release it needs dynamics and i need all those things for a menu item
9139416 a french chef would tell you dont roll boil vigorously the stock when youre cooking and then the chinese chef i worked with for years told me roll the stock you wanna roll it and make it boil theres no right or wrong way its just whatever you are trying to accomplish
9139417 the show will teach people how to shop for it how to know if its good how much you should be paying how to use it when you bring it home
9139418 gov palin has more executive experience than sen obama sen biden and sen schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9139419 when you look at a candidate you should ask two questions what have you done and what have you run
9139420 unlimited together were unlimited together well be the greatest team theres ever been
9139421 the steps needed to be in full compliance they accepted the responsibility for the oversights and worked with us cooperatively in outlining this agreement
9139422 we took a very long abandoned and polluted industrial site and decided to purchase it clean it up and restore it and basically return it to the tax rolls to benefit the local economy
9139423 we referred to it as our effort to de rust the rust belt
9139424 pose any health issue for employees neighboring businesses or area residents
9139425 it took us some time to figure out what the voc measurements were for the industrial process we do then to understand what the best technology is to rectify it
9139426 it would have been wonderful if we had understood this perfectly
9139427 needed a much more intensive computer system that was focused on record keeping helping us catalog all our required data keeping track of all site renovations and also training and we have put that in place
9139428 glad dep keeps such a tight lookout it helps make sure were compliant everything we do has to be in 100 percent compliance with the highest possible environmental standards this makes gamesa better in the long run
9139429 someone should keep a lessons learned list so we can apply this on an industry wide basis we hope to continue to make this site in every way shape and form gold stars warts and all a national example of how to do it
9139430 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pennsylvania are going through
9139431 we think that pennsylvanias demographics fit mccains candidacy much better than they fit obamas
9139432 he seemed to come out of nowhere one day hes nobody the next hes on oprah
9139433 the state of our economy is so awful and the republicans got us here
9139434 its about time for a change sooner or later its going to happen
9139435 i like that she is pro life and like me she has a child with disabilities
9139436 but she is so young and she doesnt have much experience
9139437 i know a lot of people on vacation dont want to hear that but we cant afford to have anyone injured in an incident like this
9139438 theres no doubt in my mind that the first batch we found was deliberately set and the batch we found today seems to be similar to whats washing up in ocean city and in one to two other towns
9139439 this material is waterlogged and looks like it has been in the water for quite a while
9139440 its a shame its a real shame for the town especially on a holiday weekend
9139441 were just glad it didnt happen on memorial day weekend because that could taint the entire season
9139442 something like this happening early in the season might make some people think twice about coming here
9139443 but i think by now the people who live here or have summer homes here are so loyal to the town they realize that what happened isnt the fault of anything the town has done
9139444 im more concerned about the safety of the people on the beach than whether or not theyll come down and shop in my store
9139445 i think thats the attitude of pretty much everyone here and i think thats why people are so loyal to avalon
9139446 its not the best of times but i dont think it colors the image of the town because i think people realize this is an isolated problem and not the kind of thing that was going with the ocean dumping in the 1980s
9139447 i havent heard about any mass cancellations from the hotel and motel people
9139448 and i think that the public appreciates that we are all taking precautionary measures to protect them
9139449 gov palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
9139450 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9139451 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9139452 i have found the right partner to fight those who put their privilege ahead of their responsibility power ahead of principle
9139453 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9139454 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9139455 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team her inexperience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9139456 proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9139457 yet another encouraging sign that the old barriers are falling in our politics
9139458 anything is possible all i know is that i and mr garzone will be in courtroom 901 at 9 a m on tuesday
9139459 i thought there was something wrong with me i didnt fit with the cheerleader set
9139460 through the indicator i learned that the way i am is ok
9139461 i was a type that a lot of other people were introverted that freed me to go through the world being who i was
9139462 i was the only woman in some of those lecture halls
9139463 one thing ive learned in life are the limits of control
9139464 the purpose of knowing your type is to give you a better feeling about who you are but the next step for us is to help people look at their imperfections to see accept and forgive their dark side instead of projecting it out on other people
9139465 perception of trump as a businessman of extraordinary means and ability which he is
9139466 the new york supreme court ruled that even the publisher of the new york times is not shielded from the legal process when it comes to his knowledge of timothy obriens actual malice toward donald trump
9139467 donald is easy to lampoon but harder to portray accurately and deep down inside hes really sort of likable in the way that endearing but out of control 8 year olds are likable
9139468 he did see the cover art about six months ago and called to tell me i loooovvve this
9139469 we feel this is the right decision toward further enhancing shareholder value in geo
9139470 this is a major development its going to take a while to sort things out
9139471 to date the county has felt it was more economically feasible to outsource im sure the prison board is going to go back to square one and see what it looks like right now
9139472 i know a lot of people on vacation dont want to hear that but we cant afford to have anyone injured in an incident like this
9139473 theres no doubt in my mind that the first batch we found was deliberately set and the batch we found today seems to be similar to whats washing up in ocean city and in one to two other towns

9139483 and i think that the public appreciates that we are all taking precautionary measures to protect them
9139484 you can come in here and be put in the life of a soldier
9139485 its not hey we got your phone number and address
9139486 without talking to somebody they can learn on their own
9139487 we want to avoid having a problem so we are reacting to that
9139488 it is a big turnabout from the tradition of the museum being free
9139489 a lot of students come in motor coaches and are well funded others come in yellow school buses with sack lunches those are the people i am concerned about
9139490 this weekend were going down to take apart stuff that a lot of blood and sweat went into we were asking ourselves what would be the saddest thing taking down the gate or the sign outside
9139491 is going to go back to the way it was
9139492 it was dangerous if you were back on a trail you didnt know if everyone was coming from the other direction
9139493 people will come in through the back woods thats what happens when they have nowhere else to go
9139494 we looked for a way of solving the problem a positive use to push them out
9139495 the problem with the solution is that that kind of intensive recreational use is not permitted in a preservation area of the pinelands
9139496 it was an environmental mess when we got it and we cleaned it up
9139497 people were mad that we tried to stop them from coming in it was tough and a little chaotic there were threats
9139498 this is private property and we will be patrolling it with the state police
9139499 we also have found and suggested suitable locations for the park but the problem is this is a very controversial use
9139500 dont want it the strategy for the state is to buy a piece of property and provide it as an off road vehicle park the off road groups could also buy a piece of property of their own
9139501 it boils down to this there are over 300 000 atvs in new jersey and there is no official place to go
9139502 i pulled together all the ways that the world was handling recycling composting etc and discards and i put them in once place because the world likes one stop shops
9139503 so when cities are talking big money for example right now in fredrick md theyre talking about a 300 million dollar incinerator i can talk 300 million dollars too and we can talk about getting 90 percent of your resources out of the incinerators
9139504 to feed incinerators and landfills the world must keep using a single mixed waste trash can
9139505 the key to making zero waste profitable is that people are required to sort their waste three ways recycling composting and trash
9139506 you will never know how it feels to be torn between whats real and whats fake
9139507 everything was easy for you what the fuck do you know about not being perfect
9139508 time will not be as forgiven you will never be able to withstand the blows that will collapse your confidence and break your self esteem
9139509 they will never cross you they will never know you but forever they will regret your existence
9139510 theyre unforgiving and they will only make you pass away from me
9139511 while we are encouraged to see contingency measures put in place in our model we continue to assume a three month reduction of supply from the three affected mines
9139512 if we were to assume that the strike continues for the remainder of 2008 our full year eps estimate would drop to approximately us 11 94 from us 12 69

9139515 its sad because tucson had supported it for so long said former tucson toros general manager paul moskau now an administrator at fenster school
9139516 its going to be a sad day for people who follow baseball in tucson said mike feder the former toros and sidewinders general manager
9139517 its been a long run that last day is going to feel a bit awkward
9139518 hopefully the community will miss the team that said former owner jay zucker made a business deal to sell he tried to bring in local owners and it didnt work out
9139519 ive had so much focus about us going into the next project that i wont feel empty but therell be sadness said zucker who spent the last season as a consultant to the new sidewinders owners
9139520 no emptiness ive filled the void with something very special
9139521 were going to focus on it as a celebration of triple a baseball in tucson and its 40 years zucker said
9139522 i blame it on the town they dont support it enough said former toros player carlo colombino a member of tucsons first aaa championship in 1991
9139523 you have to support your local teams win or lose i truly think it was a mistake moving from hi corbett to the new stadium
9139524 playing in tucson and having a history being in tucson playing at ua my fondest memories were in tucson
9139525 we won a championship there we still love going back there
9139526 i was sad to see them move to the new place hi corbett seemed friendlier and more cozy i never saw a game there at tep but i know hi corbett is in the heart of tucson and it made sense to have it there
9139527 my theory is that once the team moved to tep and the diamondbacks started their franchise a lot of the fans became diamondbacks fans
9139528 they are only 90 miles away they saw those players its not the dbacks fault its reality
9139529 i had a great time said moskau a gm in the late 1980s
9139530 i enjoyed the communication with the players watching them progress some of them knew what i did and that i went through the minors to get to the majors
9139531 thats pretty memorable at least i can show my kids some day he said laughing
9139532 i still think winning that championship will be the highlight of it all
9139533 first idiot out of the dugout in 1991 when trent hubbard scored the winning run on joe mikuliks late game single to beat calgary in the best of five championship
9139534 that team was special because it was one of those teams that came together he said
9139535 we all played with a lot of heart it was the best group of guys ive ever played with without a doubt
9139536 putting on my seat belt was hard simple things like that
9139537 his range of motion is coming back but the strength isnt there
9139538 i would love to have him in week 3 or 4 that would be great but if he comes back too soon that could hurt him for life in the long haul i want him to be healthy so youve got to be patient
9139539 from a training standpoint its extremely frustrating because im coming off a great year
9139540 i trained well and was in the best shape ever for east west and then the injury happened im going into my fourth year and we have a lot of returning players and i was expecting to be a guy to help carry the team
9139541 if i dont play its not the end of the world
9139542 it will be difficult because ive never missed a game in my entire life but my team is going to need me more for the latter part of the season rather than the beginning so its better to get to 100 per cent
9139543 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide

9139545 i thought why would this little baby see a relationship to barack obama
9139546 i prayed for the lord to send us a black president before i leave this world

9139548 its just a changing of the guard of what kids want to be like more than being a rapper and an athlete more than what they see on the street corner
9139549 hes gone and far exceeded the expectations of what a black man can do coming over from africa to being in slavery to civil rights to jim crow laws we came so far
9139550 it becomes a movement if it has staying power beyond one candidacy its not clear if theres that organizing effort that would be needed to overthrow the old guard

9139555 you never know how extensive and wonderful your community is until you get involved
9139556 we think of this less as a pageant and more about service and achievement which is what rotary is all about
9139557 with all the negative things you read this is so refreshing to see all these high achieving young women
9139558 they need to be there people need to have them or it can get pretty dismal if youre a team that never has any expectations
9139559 the canadiens are going into their 100th anniversary season and wed like it to be one we could really enjoy and celebrate
9139560 there are no guarantees thats what sports is about but weve tried to direct our team to be a little stronger every year for the past three or four years mostly through the maturity of the younger players
9139561 our focus going into the summer was to try to reinforce our group of forwards
9139562 we needed to replace michael on our team and thats where alex tanguay came into the equation
9139563 some of our younger players really improved last year and made us a much stronger offensive team we scored perhaps more goals than anybody else in the nhl last year and felt like the fact that many of those guys were not really physically big players and a number of them european players that they might be able to use the presence of a big brother so that was the addition of georges laraque
9139564 theres been no change in our contact with mats sundin about the possibility of him joining our team
9139565 i havent heard of any other change either from the other teams or from him that hes decided hes going to come back and play
9139566 he wouldnt be required to do everything on his own theres a variety of other good players who could play beside him
9139567 he was a bit of a throwback a totally honorable guy but he lit up a room
9139568 we take a look at them and make sure theyre safe

9139574 one of the largest industry sectors is the agricultural industry
9139575 we did survey some of our members and it would appear that of those that had non family members as employees roughly 15 percent were using workers compensation and then another relatively small percentage were using private industry programs that provided some coverage as well
9139576 theyre not just covered when theyre at work theyre also covered when they are off of work they could be gone playing hockey and theyre covered
9139577 if we offer a reasonable package that might attract more labour back to the farm
9139578 if you were an employee that wasnt covered under this new labour standards code youre probably not going to be required to be covered under workers compensation
9139579 for a lot of the small farms the family operated farms if theyre not bringing in labour they will still have free choice whether to go through private insurance thats fairly positive for those farms
9139580 its really important i think to get this particular piece of the regulation correct
9139581 were going to consult with the producers and the commodity groups to look at what the definition of family member means so we know who will be excluded
9139582 we would really like to see the government allow those producers to continue to use their private insurance

9139742 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
9139743 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
9139744 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
9139745 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
9139746 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
9139747 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true

9139751 as much as you want to be a leader on the ice you have to be even more of a leader off the ice
9139752 youve got to teach the younger guys what to do and how to follow because if you dont show them who will youve got to work hard in practice and show that you can bring leadership to the team as well
9139753 if it turns out i get traded i get traded if thats what they decide they want to do i cant worry about that i understand how things work and i cant worry about something thats not in my hands all i can do is go on the ice and work my hardest thats what i can control

9139822 the offer was too low and given that new management was brought in the plan is to run the business not to sell it off

9139831 it is very disappointing that pakistan havent played a test match this year i dont think such a thing has happened to any country in the past
9139832 we would have played at least three tests had australia toured pakistan but it is very sad that we are having a year without tests the more test matches in pakistan the better for the country since test cricket is the real test of a players temperament and skill
9139833 gilchrist was one of the two most successful players for us in the season alongwith rohit sharma he played some really good innings and his input was very good at times on the field if they do appoint adam as captain i think he would be a better choice than laxman
9139834 at times laxman lost the plot on the field twenty20 cricket is not his forte adam is more comfortable in this type of cricket
9139835 it is the captain who has to deliver on the field under pressure the players look to him the coachs role is restricted to motivating the players
9139836 i want to thank tucson and everyone else from other places that have either donated money for our family left or sent notes prayed for us brought us meals participated at his service the list is endless

9139838 between the donations and eriks benefits at least i dont have to worry about money right now
9139839 i want to get around to writing thank you notes but my main focus right now is on getting through the day and caring for myself and my children

9139848 she even comes with a ready made investigation of her office
9139849 maybe if you were governor of california or new york that would be true
9139850 all anyone has been talking about but no one here knows who she is
9139851 this is going to bring so many hillary clinton voters to the republicans
9139852 in addition to singing and piano she also plays the violin and shes around grade 5 level on both instruments she gets up every morning at 6am to practice before she goes to school
9139853 she tinkers around the piano with them and aint no way was one which she had recorded which is what we sent in

9139860 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9139861 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9139862 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9139863 its been kind of my goal the last month or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9139864 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my mind to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9139865 the second leg will be away they beat barcelona the other night
9139866 they are very passionate fans so we will have to do very well at home to start with
9139867 im not saying im concerned but we have to be careful it will be a competitive tie for sure
9139868 i think the talent is there the quality is there its just a question of confidence the new players settling in
9139869 it is a tough competition as there are sides in it who should be playing in the champions league
9139870 harry takes all competitions seriously and he will need a strong side we have not got the biggest squad so it is important to get the balance right
9139871 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9139872 as long as i dont have to touch spiders im cool
9139873 i didnt really know that people were growing fruits in oakland there are all kinds
9139874 i had no idea how much fruit there was and how much you can get done with just four or eight kids
9139875 when youve got hundreds of pounds of fruit falling it makes a big mess people call us desperate residents cant possibly use a lot of it
9139876 it makes you think on a citywide scale what can be done in the long term future to satisfy the needs of oakland residents
9139877 thats what im going to tell my kids one day
9139878 straighten up and fly right straighten up and stay right straighten up and fly right cool down bubba dont you blow your top

9139880 you are choking me release your hold and i will set you free
9139881 your story is so touching but it sounds just like a lie
9139882 so straighten up and fly right straighten up and stay right straighten up and fly right cool down bubba dont you blow your top
9139883 you are choking me release your hold and i will set you free
9139884 story is so touching but it sounds just like a lie
9139885 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9139886 first one in the club last one to leave tried to be a player socially tried to have as many girls tried it all and found no satisfaction in any of that
9139887 i bring that up because it was the old me
9139888 i did not get any satisfaction out of any of that it led to a road that brought emptiness
9139889 i was up in the hospital i think after my sixth or seventh surgery and i was thinking i need a change i need some help and those two came and prayed for me
9139890 they were like you need to come to bible study start coming to church and i thought its not going to hurt thats where it started those two planted that seed god has been faithful to water it and its just grown and hes blessed me abundantly
9139891 honestly the actual injury i had wasnt that big of a deal it was just the infection
9139892 doctors said were going to put you on these antibiotics and hopefully it takes care of it it might not it didnt for a long time until i got down on my knees and prayed and it went away i started getting better
9139893 a guy who faces adversity like that the inner toughness he has the drive and determination he has just says a lot about him and his faith
9139894 he has a lot of faith in christ and his walk with god hes a great story
9139895 i dont think a lot of people have with what hes gone through not only in college but growing up hes had some adversity to overcome he has the determination and drive to understand what he wants in life and go get it and hes going to be successful because of that
9139896 because it gives me an opportunity to tell how good god is

9139929 anthropological data suggest there may be something a little unnatural about adults playing with children
9139930 this implies that children do not require play with an adult in order to develop normally
9139931 everyone recognizes that for children to be children they need time to play
9139932 play at any stage of a childs development helps instill a sense of accomplishment delight and both intellectual and social growth what is equally important to understand is the opportunities that play provides parents to engage with their children to praise and encourage them in ways that instill strong and enduring bonds
9139933 laughter and engagement in active play is essential to the well being of your child

9139950 growing natives can enhance our enjoyment of the natural environment and create habitat for wildlife
9139951 natives generally require less input of water fertilizer and maintenance once established they come in all shapes sizes and colors adding to the beauty of the garden
9139952 ive been interested in our native flora from childhood i like to know the names of the plants i see along the trail and roadside
9139953 we garden in fits and spurts well rework a bed one year when we have time and then it may not get much attention for a few years until it gets overgrown or we dont like the looks of it any more
9139954 my father gardened extensively so i was exposed to gardening from the time i could walk when i moved out of the dorms in college 1976 i got a community garden plot and planted vegetables wanting to grow my own tasty fresh produce ive had a garden of some sort ever since
9139955 were still struggling with how much we need to water during the dry summer months part of our garden is in full sun with shallow soil most of what we plant there is quite drought tolerant but even so it gets very dry and plants suffer sometimes we dont notice until the plants are showing signs of stress and then well water it really comes down to plant choices and regular observation
9139956 some of my favorite flowers are natives that ive never seen anyone grow in their garden such as elephants head lousewort pedicularis groenlandica and other members of the genus ive always liked trilliums going back to my childhood in west virginia
9139957 in the vegetable garden we grow a lot of tomatoes and almost never buy them in the store we also grow snap peas broccoli green beans and lots of salad greens we dont grow veggies we dont like
9139958 growing vegetables west of the cascades the complete guide to natural gardening
9139959 our guide to gardening here after moving from the very different climate in nebraska
9139960 it includes downloadable booklets that include plant lists for various habitats and is an excellent regional resource
9139961 in our garden european brown slugs are the biggest pest although in reality they dont do as much damage as one might expect they do like lily foliage and young vegetable seedlings as theyre emerging so we use slug bait around those
9139962 a woody evergreen spreader that stays low to the ground has fairly inconspicuous flowers in the spring and red berries in the fall
9139963 a woodland plant that spreads nicely to cover a wide area in other words be careful that you dont put it where you dont want it to spread
9139964 grow this one for the evergreen leathery foliage because the deep purple flowers are hidden right on the ground under the leaves it grows in dappled shade with reasonable moisture
9139965 leathery evergreen leaves and white up facing flowers in the spring spreads by stolons and is good for sunny to partly sunny locations
9139966 heart shaped leaves held parallel to the ground with a spike of white flowers in the spring can also be an aggressive spreader it prefers some shade
9139967 both of these bulbs produce beautiful clusters of blue flowers in the spring they prefer moist meadows in full sun
9139968 both of these prefer mostly sunny locations and a fair amount of moisture but not soggy
9139969 these require humus rich moist soils in part shade and bloom in the spring the foliage dies back in the summer
9139970 an east side plant that grows mostly at mid elevations in the mountains grow in full sun in well drained soil
9139971 a very common woodland wildflower that blooms in may prefers humus y soil in dappled shade
9139972 a little mat forming member of the rose family that grows on scree at high elevations in the mountains but is quite happy to grow in well drained soil in whatcom county
9139973 a native of dry sites on the east side it bloomed for me in its second year in the garden
9139974 a widespread species found in a wide variety of habitats across much of the u s
9139975 native to southern oregon and once considered difficult to grow in cultivation
9139976 both of these are quite adaptable to both sun and shade although they both prefer at least some shade during the day the fruit is edible but tart so best used in jelly
9139977 spectacular spring show with bright reddish pink flowers that attract hummingbirds followed by blue purple fruit that is edible but best left for the birds
9139978 slow growing so sometimes planted as a groundcover but eventually forming dense thickets about chest high covered in drooping clusters of pale pink flowers in the spring and leathery deep blue fruit in late summer the fruit is edible and tasty but the skins are a little tough
9139979 our state flower and a very attractive garden plant that doesnt show up at the nursery nearly as often as the myriad other rhody choices
9139980 leathery evergreen leaves delicate pendant white flowers in the spring and tasty small fruit in the summer not found in the wild in whatcom county but grows well here when planted
9139981 a fine understory tree with nice structure adaptable to pruning and shaping prefers shade but will tolerate some sun and nice fall color stays relatively small
9139982 a medium sized tree with showy white bracts most people think theyre the flowers in the spring that prefers part shade
9139983 adaptable tree with pendant clusters of white flowers in the spring and small fruit attractive to birds in the summer
9139984 both are very shade tolerant western hemlock may get too large for the garden so slower growing mountain hemlock may be a better choice
9139985 beautiful bark small heart shaped leaves that turn golden in autumn spreads from its roots eventually forming large clones
9139986 we tried everything but we have to think of our clients and the attorneys ethical obligations
9139987 the reason weve received for not being allowed to fill positions is that we have some budget problems
9139988 but in tough economic times the crime rate doesnt go down it goes up
9139989 fortunately these are misdemeanor cases and theyre easier to handle than felonies
9139990 still the implications are often the same as felonies a criminal record jail time fines they have to be addressed with the same seriousness as felony representation
9139991 mr gambari has made six visits to burma but nothing has happened we consider it a waste of time
9139992 cotnoir cepero is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe online gaming economy business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www cdc gov for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our online gaming economy knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of mugrage zweifel of www lonelyplanet com we are sure to turn a profit
9139993 i want to get on board as soon as possible but my risk tolerance in the online gaming economy industry is much lower than others ill join after first quarter profits are reported to stock markets and investors
9139994 i see good things for this online gaming economy startup company
9139995 and you can bet the ranch that things are only going to get better
9139996 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
9139997 i want this online gaming economy project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this online gaming economy event is a great start
9139998 because my experience has been that online gaming economy companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because online gaming economy consumers like those found on www un org or www javascriptkit com are not ready for a new paradigm
9139999 im happy to see that my collegue kulesa picciuto believes in this project
