7500000 we dont have any cause to quarrel or fight with anybody in authority if there is going to be a market anywhere in buea let it be but we must have our market which was created by the women of great soppo and has existed for 32 years
7500001 that is not true the mayor wrote to me on may 28 requesting for a site he gave me three months which means by august 28 i should be able to give him a site but it was not up to august 20 he went ahead and announced that we have not provided a site i think i still have about two weeks to provide a site for the market and i am confident that before the deadline i will have a site for the market
7500002 right now the present mayor wants to relocate it out of great soppo if they are going to move the market from the present site for whatever reason we shall go back to the former site and build our small daily great soppo womens market
7500003 that will be fine but as at now i cannot rule out the relocation until he provides the site
7500004 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue

7500008 we contributed nearly one million dollars to support all our beijing bound athletes
7500009 but we have now decided to set aside eleven million dollars annually in view of the countrys show in the beijing games
7500010 this fund would be initially used to assist prospective medal winners in boxing judo swimming and archery but we are open to helping any other deserving sportsperson from any other discipline
7500011 the credit for this unique initiative taken by the board goes solely to our president sharad pawar who first thought about it last year
7500012 after pawars proposal we amended the boards constitution as it did not provide for spending funds on any activity not related to cricket
7500013 we increased our spending on infrastructure development manifold and also started a monthly gratis scheme for former players and officials after meeting all our targets we decided to help other sports
7500014 bcci is our richest sports body and pawar has been kind enough to give an annual grant of eleven million dollars for development of olympic sports
7500015 this gesture just when the country has done so well in the beijing olympics will be welcomed by all our people and will give a boost to sports which have been suffering due to lack of adequate finances

7500186 ho assistito a una deplorevole scena di crudelt gratuita commenta un testimone i vigili urbani hanno trascinato e strattonato un ragazzo di colore perch non era in possesso della licenza alcuni miei amici hanno scattato delle foto con il cellulare i vigili urbani inutile che cerchino giustificazioni poich non vero come affermano che lambulante ha avuto una reazione eccessiva e che li ha autorizzati ad usare violenza nei suoi confronti ero presente ai fatti e ho ancora nelle orecchie la voce e il pianto dellextracomunitario che supplicava
7500187 non so nulla ero in ferie sto apprendendo ora quanto successo una cosa per certa se i vigili hanno agito in quel modo perch evidentemente c stata una reazione spropositata del giovane le regole in qualche modo le dobbiamo fare rispettare capisco che certe scene possono apparire pi o meno cruente ma dipende dalla reazione del soggetto

7500201 its a sign that the best way to celebrate michael phelps 8 gold achievement is to eat dessert
7500202 every eight weeks i have new pieces coming into the store
7500203 so were designing like crazy like tons of stuff and its so much fun
7500204 it was a great opportunity for me to do this and now that im older and more into fashion and stuff ive put together a cute little line its totally my style and everything i would wear its absolutely my wardrobe
7500205 my dad gave me the nickname abbey dawn when i was a little girl
7500206 it was a street he saw and all my friends in high school called me abbey i always really liked the name i didnt know if maybe i would name my girl abbey if i had a girl one day or a song name so i had a clothing line first so i named it abbey dawn
7500207 ive seen some of the fans at my shows wearing my shirts and sometimes ive been onstage wearing one of the shirts
7500208 and they have the same one on and im like hey nice shirt and i get really excited
7500209 it feels so great to be back on the scene
7500210 i went through a struggle and i really needed to get myself together and connect with my purpose which is music
7500211 music is all i know to be on this set today i feel very blessed for the second chance and for the opportunity my record company believing in me and everybody here just showing me so much love and support my fans it just feels good to be back and i never wanna leave for that long again
7500212 i mean its a chemistry thats undeniable its magical i think its our responsibility to make music together i think its our contribution to the world i mean i think that we have a place a lane and we have people out there that love seeing us working together and again im just blessed to be back working with him right here departed was the first song that i heard that rodney wanted to do for with me and that was the first song i did with him our reconnect and its our first single so our experience this time has been very magical our sound is a little bit different from our old sound but we are back and im never leaving rodney again and i hope he never leaves me
7500213 i mean at the end of the day we wanted to do something for the fans and show the world that we got this chemistry that cant be denied and cant be stopped
7500214 its definitely a big pop sounding album international sounding but she hits a little bit on the country side
7500215 vocally she does a lot of little country twangs with her voice we kid around we joke around that the next album is gonna be country were both gonna step out and do some country music but were kinda tapping into it to show that you can mix that sound with urban and r amp b and hip hop its just music and good music lives
7500216 i wanted to make it for everybody not just urban but every race every color every creed whatever
7500217 i just wanted to make a universal album and thats what we did and we accomplished that and im really excited about it its out november 11 and we launch it november 10 with oprah so im really excited
7500218 i wrote the title track to the album and basically what that song is about is forgiveness mistakes are gonna be made were all gonna make them one of the lines in the song is im only human i might just tell a lie im only human im an angel in disguise theres another song on the album called warm it up with love im talking about how the whole world is freezing but we just need to warm the world up with love then theres piano man where i go to this piano man and ask him to play a song of love play a song about heartache so we can have the whole world singing tonight its really some cool concepts on the album
7500219 you can take it like youre talking about a mother and a daughter a sister brother girlfriend whatever its universal in that way
7500220 and the video concept is me crossing over to the other side and coming back into my familys life just popping up everywhere just singing to them and its got an i am legend feel sometimes you see me on the street by myself completely and its pretty cool little x is directing it im really excited about it i just hope it turns out great and everybody loves it
7500221 i always try to get in it when i can
7500222 if it dont make sense then i dont do it but she called me down i canceled all my plans i had a show to do somewhere else but im gonna be here for this video cause i know how important it is for her and i know just how important it is to be around and just support her and whatever she needs so im here for her
7500223 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7500224 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7500225 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7500226 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7500227 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
7500228 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

7500231 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

7500233 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
7500234 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
7500235 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
7500236 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7500237 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7500238 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7500239 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
7500240 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
7500241 i think the other ones are so critically acclaimed by fans i wanna keep that competiveness up with myself
7500242 theyll compare this one to the other mixtape messiahs mixtape messiah 1 is probably my biggest one thus far it came out of nowhere at that time i had the beef with mike jones and it was a triple disc cd nobody did that it was real shock value im gonna keep on competing with myself i might not drop a triple disc its a double disc this time but its two cds full of nothing but new material
7500243 sometimes i say punch lines to myself and be like this punch line is trying a little too hard
7500244 but i know my fans like that so imma give it to them a lot of fans that like me like me because i used to take whoevers beat was hot and even beats that werent hot that were classic lets get it
7500245 we did the digital release a lot of people were hesitant to put out music a little while ago in the mixtape game i seen a lot of djs stop dropping mixtapes i put mine out online for free i think it says a lot though when youre taking the time to press it up and doing the actual cd it needs to be physically in the street and hit them nooks and crannies theres spots where the big artists dont go but thats where im gonna go we gonna start off slow and go with it
7500246 thats crazy because a lot of my fans think i been on vacation
7500247 on a couple of the other mixtape messiah records i did a roll call and its a fire drill of all the other rappers
7500248 i call it a fire drill because we run down a list of everybody thats hot and im gonna exactly rap their styles just to be creative i start off with jeezy then i do jim jones i do rich boy game jay z i do e 40 lil weezy rick ross i had to cut the record because i did whole bunch of people i took a b g beat and just repped that this is just one thing to show creativity
7500249 even though im dropping this in the streets i see rappers online and it matters whats said online you go to mtvnews com and see what they saying on mixtape monday fans complain about everything they complain about weezy when he does right when he do wrong same thing with kanye and everybody me and my boys went to all these web sites and we took a whole list of everything everybody said bad about chamillionaire i did a rap like im the person sitting at the computer typing and saying bad stuff about chamilllionaire its some little kid thats on the internet hes young hes getting all this stuff hes saying about me his mother comes in and asks him did you take your medication are you on those porno sites again im rapping like im him in his voice
7500250 i dont know what album its on i really mess with the clipse too i remember saying who did this beat it was just knocking i told my dj to send the instrumental and said im about to rip this no purpose just a whole bunch of punch lines bringing a little aggressiveness to the mixtape people might have seen me in my last video dressed like a white man they might have got it twisted were bringing it back to the streets
7500251 yeah im back fresh off the hate cation i let the hatas take a break now imma let it out the bag like jake the snake
7500252 anybody who knows me know i love to step out to the collabo world best verse thats a hard one i go in different lanes i give it my all wherever i step up
7500253 you might be looking at two of the producers on that losos way coming this thanksgiving were letting the world know were coming now
7500254 the record started off a freestyle then the traction went real major
7500255 i dont know the title yet its showing a different side we had the one man band that was a lot more hype a lot more all over the place this album we got john legend did my intro were just exploring a whole other side of my movement
7500256 i told myself imma go back to the old flip doing a whole bunch of music with a bunch of independent cats
7500257 that ones been done every time i drop an album i wanna do a december release every time it gets pushed back i never get to get none of the christmas money imma come in december with the real album

7500265 andrew strom says there are 9 lies in the church
7500266 it is a sad fact that todays church is deceiving itself in some very crucial areas actually in many other areas now too below are some plain facts that may shock a few people
7500267 and the tithe itself now was not used to support any church buildings but solely the poor people and the church workers and their families and the people who received the tithe were not allowed to own any property as well
7500268 there were no bible colleges seminaries or degrees in the new testament
7500269 th ere is almost no evidence whatsoever that the early church had their
7500270 the idea that you can replace the moving of the holy spirit with programs programs and more programs just shows how low we have sunk

7500378 seals that would reveal tampering should be used on all voting equipment election security information should be added to poll workers training manuals there should be increased vigilance about security procedures at absentee polling places and state owned voting machines should be used in the north slope borough rather than borrowing borough owned machines
7500379 that tamper evident seals have been placed on all equipment
7500380 alaska voters can now go to the polls and cast their ballots knowing that their votes are secure

7500397 our country suffered through three decades of war and when the diag program started here in panjshir the district of anaba became a district of peace
7500398 those weapons that we used to fight against our enemies are the same weapons that we handed in for the diag program
7500399 this is a province known for its history of fighting the good fight and now our fight is for both peace and reconstruction
7500400 and that is why the diag process worked very well here in anaba and is continuing to work throughout panjshir
7500401 we hope that the next district of panjshir becomes peaceful and then the next and the next and soon all of afghanistan will not think of the people of panjshir only as the fighters they once were
7500402 panjshir people have fought seven times during this generation and many people have died
7500403 it really became our job to take up arms and fight against an enemy now the weapons we used to fight with belong to afghanistan and our jobs are to help rebuild and revitalize our district

7500476 sie sagte sie habe die weste an wolle den anschlag aber nicht ver ben
7500477 berbiete das die spiele von peking endeten so spektakul r wie sie begonnen haben
7500478 die bergabe hat mehr an die zeiten des swinging london als an die kosmopolitische finanzmetropole die sie heute ist erinnert wenn das ein statement der organisatoren war sich nicht mit der gr e und dem spektakel von peking zu messen sondern stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen so ist das empfehlenswert
7500479 wir sollten etwas skurril britisches bieten mit einem langanhaltenden erbe und ohne schrecklichen kater als die spiele von peking zu einem spektakul ren ende kamen gab londons b rgermeister boris johnson einen grellen vorgeschmack auf den individuellen stil der in vier jahren erwartet werden kann die schrullige show stand im kontrast zu der perfekt abgestimmten extravaganz der chinesen in gigantischen dimensionen au ergew hnlichen farbeffekten einem bombardement von feuerwerk und atemberaubender artistik
7500480 london kann es nur mit einer kollektiven anstrengung schaffen und einem enthusiasmus den viele wom glich f r unzeitgem oder v llig unbritisch halten
7500481 au er den technischen dingen kann london nur sehr wenig von peking lernen nie wieder wird eine nation das geld und den politischen willen aufbringen um olympische spiele diesen ausma es hervorzubringen
7500482 wir m ssen es auf unsere weise tun der traum von london 2012 ist jetzt realit t geworden und in den n chsten vier jahren wird sich die bohrende aufmerksamkeit der welt nach gro britannien richten wenn wir irgendetwas von peking gelernt haben dann ist es nicht noch einmal zu versuchen was hier in china gemacht wurde f r diese spiele waren die kosten unz hlbar
7500483 wenn es irgendwelche zweifel gab dass die spiele 2012 in london anders sein werden als die in peking sind sie mit dem auftritt von londons b rgermeister boris johnson verschwunden ein frecher schuljunge unter erwachsenen
7500484 die ordnung und der pomp der er ffnungsfeier wurde ersetzt durch leichtigkeit frivolit t und spa die schlussfeier erinnerte an eine gigantische party
7500485 die spiele waren ein zweifelhafter triumph f r china die welt bewunderte die organisation und die finanziellen mittel von den sportst tten bis zu den verschwenderischen zeremonien auf der anderen seite war es bei allem zu viel der organisation
7500486 fast perfekte organisation rekordflut legend re leistungen die ersten olympischen spiele in china waren ein gro er jahrgang der dem asiatischen riesen erlaubt hat seine kraft unter beweis zu stellen der aber auch die grenzen seiner toleranz aufgezeigt hat
7500487 china auf der ganzen linie siegreich die organisation war perfekt die opposition wurde erstickt und der sportliche erfolg hat sich eingestellt
7500488 china ein koloss mit hundert medaillen die schlussfeier hebt die sportlichen erfolge des landes hervor sie ist zwar informeller als die er ffnungszeremonie sie ist aber trotzdem magisch gigantisch und perfekt
7500489 die olympischen spiele sind zu ende und china ist ein bisschen n herger ckt zumindest hoffen wir es der schlafende gigant asiens ist erwacht und verlangt einen platz in der welt
7500490 die gigantische sensationsshow die sommerspiele 2008 bertrafen alles was organisation ablauf und pr zision betrifft
7500491 bye bye peking eine farbenfrohe und stimmungsvolle abschlussfeier china hat zum abschluss der olympischen spiele noch einmal sein leistungsverm gen demonstriert
7500492 peking schlie t die spiele mit einem sehr britischem akzent ab jetzt sind die engl nder dran die besten spiele der geschichte zu organisieren

7500502 i dont think rio should worry about losing out on the england captaincy
7500503 i dont think it is a reflection of anything other than a persons choice i dont think there was anyone nailed on for the england captains job
7500504 it was always rio or john terry it was a flip of a coin it could have gone either way i am sure it was a close call
7500505 at rios age he shouldnt be worried about the effect of that he just has to carry on he has proved himself a great centre back so there is nothing else he can do
7500506 the advantage for john terry is that he has been captaining chelsea for quite a while you have to give that consideration
7500507 in the long term rio will be our captain there is no question about that we are very very comfortable with it
7500508 his qualities of leadership have improved tremendously over the last two or three years

7500512 public officials need to be concerned officials need to remind people that many homes are vulnerable to major storms they also need to ensure safe evacuation routes are available and the public is aware of them
7500513 it is worrisome that new orleans the site of one of the most severe hurricanes in u s history has such a large proportion of people who dont know the location of an evacuation center
7500514 an important priority for government and voluntary agencies should be to inform people of the location of shelters well before a storm hits
7500515 this is not a sporting event this is money we have no room for rooting or hoping

7500519 i think this is one cheap stock at 11 backed by a great management team thats going to create value for us going forward
7500520 it remains first and best in a growing industry creates convenience for millions of consumers and is led by visionary management that markets aggressively

7500522 no acusamos a la junta de propiciar esta crisis sino de no poner soluciones ni siquiera interiores y hay que hacer algo m s que soluciones de parcheo y de un tanteo de torero aburrido que es lo que viene haciendo el gobierno regional
7500523 no se entiende como para paliar la crisis del sector lo que se hace es agravar la crisis del mismo ya que si en estos momentos el mbito inmobiliario no vende porque no hay compradores sacando 14 000 viviendas a un precio bajo lo que se hace es agravar la crisis
7500524 s lo se lo ha comunicado a ugt y a cc oo y no a este sector para ver como afrontar la situaci n actual
7500525 lo que deber a haber hecho la junta es rectificar y decir que lo que pretenden es una tonter a que lo que quer an era equilibrar la balanza para los presupuestos a trav s de la venta 14 000 viviendas y sacar de ah unos millones de euros y equilibrar el d ficit que se le viene encima
7500526 el pp no entiende esto porque l mismo indic que lo que se est pretendiendo es facilitar la adquisici n de viviendas a gente que no la tiene

7500540 if we keep lobola we need to make it payable in a way that young men can pay and afford we have to speak to our elders about that
7500541 so you have as many children as you can and beat up as many women and men to prove you are a man yet every night you go home and sleep in your mothers house
7500542 we have known for years that in informal settlements you will find the highest infection rates of hiv and aids and that young women are at the greatest risk
7500543 the documentary is meant as an audiovisual tool to support our research and advocacy work on the links between hiv and aids and peoples livelihoods and living conditions in which we take issue with the prevailing focus on hiv and aids as largely a health and behavioural issue
7500544 our core argument is that we need to pay more attention to how people live and their socio economic realities which inform or constrain their abilities to make rational choices about their sexual health and sexual experiences and which also influence their abilities to cope with hiv and aids once infected or affected
7500545 born out of our experience that words reports powerpoint presentations no matter how carefully constructed are not always effective in inspiring new thinking or changing how development actors do their work
7500546 they simply fail to see that aids cannot be delinked from our conditions of shelter from where we live who we live with how accessible clinics and medicines are and what opportunities for play and relaxation are available aids is not only a health issue
7500547 pocityvity can do that not only because a picture can tell a thousand words but because the voices of the people their stories and views highlight that aids is linked inextricably to their lives and to their environment
7500548 we are citizens first and foremost we take the promise of a new democracy and we take it into our new hands we are not going to wait for the government we are going to help the government do the right thing and we will criticise it when it does the wrong thing

7500557 weve been interested in danny for a while now i consider him the best midfielder in the russian league and he can become a very useful member of our team i see danny as an attacking midfielder or winger
7500558 yes you need to accumulate a certain amount of wealth to live in a certain way
7500559 these comebacks are only possible at the bernab u we played too far back in the first half and were too hasty in attack we made too many long passes
7500560 ironically both red cards played in our favour because they made us react we must nevertheless avoid these things from happening and try to play well from the start of each game

7500575 el secreto de un buen disparo es hacer una buena b squeda y saber lo que quieres capturar yo siempre estoy realmente atento al medio y pruebo y pienso d nde puede ocurrir la mejor acci n o un momento inesperado y entonces enfoco mi c mara hacia all
7500576 iba de camino a cubrir la final masculina de los 100m en el estadio nido del p jaro apresur ndome desde mi ltimo trabajo al girar la esquina con uno de mis colegas que tambi n iba a fotografiar las pruebas de atletismo vimos una luna llena elev ndose encima del estadio y no pudimos creer nuestra suerte ya lleg bamos tarde de nuestro ltimo trabajo por lo que tuve que decidir si valdr a la pena parar a disparar esta imagen y arriesgar perder mi espacio en el estadio decid que pod a hacerlo r pidamente as que esperamos unos cuantos minutos para que la luna se colocara bien encima de la llama ol mpica afortunadamente ten a un objetivo largo conmigo ya que hubiera sido dif cil disparar la llama sin l al no haber suficiente luz natural en s encima de la antorcha y as como esper la llama borde la luna creando esta incre ble imagen
7500577 estaba fotografiando carole peon de francia en la porci n de nado en la prueba de heptal n estaba sentado en el agua y despu s de nadar 300 metros hacia la salida donde las altletas deb an dejar el agua me gusta el efecto del agua en esta imagen tomada desde una posici n inferior lo que te permite sentirte muy cerca de ellas
7500578 he fotografiado esgrima en varias ocasiones pero ste es uno de los acontecimientos que s lo fotograf as una vez cada cuatro a os en lo juegos olimpicos no habr s escuchado demasiado sobre esto pero cuando fui a cubrir el evento del 13 de agosto todo el recinto estaba lleno deb a haber unos 100 fot grafos all el recinto ten a un foco de luz en el campo de juego que le daba un efecto muy bonito a la luz cuando benjamin kleibrinkgano gan la medalla de oro empez a celebrarlo mir donde estaba sentado su entrenador y me anticip antes de que benjamin fuera a verlo que es exactamente lo que el hizo en ese mismo momento me coloqu ah lejos del resto de fot grafos para intentar obtener alguna imagen diferente esperando que benjamin se moviera hacia esa direcci n me dio un disparo claro con la luz enfoc ndole directamente
7500579 yo estaba en la piscina cuando mi editor me llam para decirme que estaba previsto que el presidente bush asistiera cuando lleg casi cae por las escaleras su servicio secreto lo cogi y a mi me hubiera encantado capturar esa imagen hubiera sido bastante divertido parec a que estaba disfrutando del acontecimiento lo estaba pasando bien y animaba al equipo americano y creo que esta imagen captura ese esp ritu
7500580 dispar esta imagen con una c mara de control remoto que hab a colocado dos horas antes del evento en la pasarela del estadio la dispar a ras del suelo en los momentos en que pens que ser a posible una buena fotograf a me gusta esta imagen porque la gimnasta est enmarcada alargada dentro de las barras de equilibrio con un traje rojo que la hace destacar de la esterilla azul

7500594 orchestrated the entire malicious dirty campaign in time for this election
7500595 it shows the level of desperation and abuse of power by the barisan nasional
7500596 i am confident god willing we will win but we are fighting an entire government machinery which has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to deny me a victory
7500597 yes there are mps in the ruling party that have expressed support for me
7500598 the issue of the sodomy allegations while it gained some traction at the beginning of the campaign by the end had reached saturation point and wont significantly affect his chances of winning
7500599 if you look at the ground support it is extremely good but we have to make sure there is no cheating
7500600 i voted for wan azizah i will vote for anwar ibrahim because i want the barisan nasional to be toppled
7500601 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
7500602 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
7500603 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
7500604 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
7500605 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
7500606 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
7500607 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
7500608 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
7500609 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
7500610 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
7500611 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
7500612 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
7500613 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
7500614 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
7500615 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
7500616 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia

7500649 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice

7500651 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7500652 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point

7500776 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
7500777 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure

7500780 it was nice to get out there and get some runs today
7500781 the plan was to bat as long as possible without putting any pressure on myself the plan worked and i am obviously pleased
7500782 at one point obama sought to assure people that he would not take away their guns
7500783 maybe i havent had the chance to show him what im about
7500784 i always felt i trained well with england and hopefully hes seen that but im yet to start a game for him
7500785 all i can do is keep knocking on the door by knocking goals in ive got a chance now to start games and if i do well at portsmouth the natural progression is to get in the national side
7500786 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7500787 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7500788 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7500789 it is a tricky enough game anyway but we are aware there might be a backlash from the chelsea defeat by portsmouth
7500790 we have played them a couple of times already in pre season which maybe helps a bit because it is important to get that win the manager has a few more things to deal with with us coming back from international week but we do not want to give other teams a head start
7500791 i always look forward to these games and we have a tremendous record against united at fratton park
7500792 last season we did not lose at home to any of the big four the key is to match their work rate sure it looks a really big test for us now but i think we are still a very good team at home and we will take some beating united wont relish coming here they never do
7500793 but its a two way street and telcos can do the same thing
7500794 operators do not compete well in the internet space to date

7500799 were in a giant car heading towards a brick wall and everyones arguing over where theyre going to sit
7500800 ive had no calls about kevin doyle for probably about two weeks plus now
7500801 brad was diving to save a shot when he caught his finger in the ground
7500802 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7500803 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7500804 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7500805 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7500806 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7500807 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7500808 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7500809 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7500810 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7500811 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7500812 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7500813 the research will fill important gaps and progress knowledge to inform prevention programs
7500814 the research projects will examine the management of middle ear disease and hearing loss in aboriginal children up to five years old target school age children and young people with prevention education and identify enablers and barriers to the use of hearing protection in the workplace
7500815 hearing loss costs the australian community about 11 75 billion a year
7500816 the hearing loss prevention program tackles the burden of preventable hearing loss in the australian community and targets young people aboriginal and torres strait islander people and people in the workplace
7500817 this week provides an opportunity for people to get information about services available and free hearing screenings at many hearing centres across the nation
7500818 although the middle tier of the market makes up nearly half of overall it spending there are few dedicated it resources focused on this segment
7500819 we feel that there is a unique opportunity to create a new business model through the marriage of consulting solutions integration development and services that are solely focused on the under served mid market
7500820 by acquiring established local it providers around the globe and bringing them together under one umbrella sparxent will act as a single source for it providing the broadest array of expertise and tools to the middle market
7500821 the key to our comprehensive approach is to bridge the gap between vars that lack the software competency to provide true integration and software development companies that are not equipped to provide a breadth of consulting services

7500855 vi f r analysera och se vad vi kommer fram till
7500856 no more than two meet up with friends per week
7500857 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7500858 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7500859 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7500860 they are quite capable of taking risks and make happy go lucky congenial workers with far reaching goals but unless driven by a strong personal desire they tend to be more casual and less ambitious than other signs allowing events to unfold rather than chasing after something that doesnt entirely inspire their interest

7500864 hey look everyone its the wizard dont put a magic spell on me now wizard wheres your jacket wizard
7500865 i expected either pixelation or blur to show up at large magnification but none of these occur theres no way i could tell i was looking at a magnified picture im very impressed
7500866 i found the chinese police officers to be much more disciplined and regimented than american police
7500867 you know i walked on i went on about my business whatever you know aint anything else about it
7500868 senator obamas proposed tax cuts for the middle class are actually marginal rate hikes in disguise
7500869 will narrative to be woven in denver be unraveled by inquisitive new media
7500870 we dont want to return to marginal rates of 60 or 70 percent
7500871 this week the least qualified man to receive a major party nomination for the presidency of the united states in modern times will be anointed by his party
7500872 all the powers of the old media the old academy and old hollywood all the forces of political correctness and establishment progressivism have entered into an alliance to try to ensure an obama victory
7500873 why is it a real race now with john mccain rising in the polls and barack obama falling
7500874 four teams of husbands and wives versus four teams of parents and their children
7500875 every person is on their own journey so even though they come together as a family they each have their own experience
7500876 so for me i have to approach it with whats appropriate for that person in that moment
7500877 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7500878 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7500879 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7500880 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7500881 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7500882 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7500883 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7500884 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7500885 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7500886 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7500887 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7500888 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7500889 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7500890 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7500891 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7500892 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7500893 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7500894 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7500895 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7500896 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7500897 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7500898 product placement is the ultimate platform for the brand and its consumers to interact
7500899 this is something that we continually monitor through a script co ordinator and placement specialist
7500900 an exciting component about product placement is that is creates consumption occasions if hilda from 7de laan uses clover milk to bake a delicious chocolate cake then fans will naturally turn to same the brand in their own homes
7500901 we are thrilled that clover sa has signed up for another season with two of south africas two most popular soapies and will continue to deliver on the amazing work which has been produced to date
7500902 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7500903 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7500904 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7500905 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7500910 the at25df081 is a clear case in which we listened to our customers and developed a product that allows them to design their applications to be smaller lighter and last longer all at a lower cost and without sacrificing performance
7500911 wir kennen die ank ndigungspolitik aus dem wohnbauressort schon zu gut wir verlangen dass beim zugang und der abrechung von waschk chen rasch eine klare vern nftige und gerechte l sung statt halbherziger l sungsans tze gefunden wird
7500912 zahlreiche betroffene sehen sich einer st ndigen belagerung der waschk chen durch mieter aus ihrem eigenen wohnbau durch deren familien aber auch durch bewohner fremder gemeindebauten ausgeliefert das bisherige system der abrechnung und aufteilung der kosten funktioniert nicht
7500913 das was wir nun als vorschlag vor uns haben ist aber nur als bescheiden zu bezeichnen
7500914 ich erwarte mir im sinne aller betroffenen eine raschere umsetzung das haben sich die mieterinnen und mieter von wiener wohnen verdient

7500925 lamentem que el pp i el psoe hagen optat conjuntament per lenergia nuclear intentant limitar el debat a un assumpte ideol gic i aprofitant se de la crisi energ tica

7500932 if barack cares so much about your family why doesnt he take care of his family first
7500933 konflikte k nnen mit milit rischen mitteln alleine nicht gel st werden ohne ein sicheres umfeld kann dauerhafter frieden nicht wirksam werden priorit res ziel der friedenskonsolidierung m ssen die verhinderung des wiederauflebens von gewaltsamen auseinandersetzung und der aufbau von strukturen sein die es einer gesellschaft erm glichen konflikte k nftig ohne die anwendung von gewalt zu l sen
7500934 nachhaltiger erfolg bedarf der vollen unterst tzung und einbindung der konfliktparteien sowie aller teile der bev lkerung eigenverantwortung verantwortlichkeit und der aufbau eines funktionierenden parlamentarischen systems sind elementare schl sselprinzipien ein besonderer focus sollte auch auf die verst rkte einbindung von frauen gelegt werden
7500935 nur durch eine enge zusammenarbeit der internationalen gemeinschaft k nnen wir positive erfolge erzielen
7500936 nicht zuletzt auch aus diesem grund wurde die kommission f r friedenskonsolidierung der vereinten nationen ein gremium welches das engagement der internationalen gemeinschaft in der bergangsphase zwischen krisenmanagement des sicherheitsrates unmittelbar nach ende eines konflikts und langfristigem wiederaufbau koordiniert geschaffen mit ihr wurde eine allseits wahrgenommene institutionelle l cke im system der vereinten nationen geschlossen bereits im kurzen zeitraum ihres bestehens konnte sie wichtige beitr ge leisten
7500937 die hauptverantwortung f r die errichtung und aufrechterhaltung des internationalen friedens und der sicherheit liegt weiterhin bei den vereinten nationen es muss uns daher ein anliegen sein ihr die notwendigen mittel daf r zur verf gung zu stellen und sie bei der durchf hrung ihrer mission entsprechend der sterreichischen tradition zu unterst tzen
7500938 das langj hrige sterreichische engagement im bereich der vereinten nationen weist viele facetten auf sterreich hat sich unter anderem neben der beteiligung an milit rischen un friedenseins tzen wie nun im tschad von anbeginn an f r die gr ndung der uno kommission zur friedenskonsolidierung und der einrichtung eines un peacebuilding fund eingesetzt und sich im bereich der herrschaft des rechts besonders engagiert
7500939 heute beginnen wir unseren intensivwahlkampf mit drei konvois die von jungen mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeitern begleitet werden werden wir bei 26 gro veranstaltungen und 52 weiteren seniorenveranstaltungen in insgesamt 280 orten in ganz sterreich um das vertrauen der sterreicherinnen und sterreicher k mpfen um eines vom bodensee bis zum neusiedlersee klar zu machen am 28 september geht es um eine richtungsentscheidung die menschen haben die wahl zwischen sicherheit und professioneller arbeit mit der vp oder dem faymann populismus des dilettantischen regierens
7500940 gute seniorenpolitik kann nur mit wilhelm molterer verwirklicht werden denn er h lt was er verspricht
7500941 den unterschied zwischen dem erfahrenen fachmann molterer der h lt was er verspricht und dem dilettanten chef faymann m chte ich ihnen an drei beispielen erl utern
7500942 an dem beispiel der eurofighter neuverhandlungen von minister darabos hat die sp ihren dilettantismus klar gezeigt wir machen uns damit zum gesp tt europas nirgendwo sonst w re man bereit f r gebrauchtes ger t mehr zu bezahlen als f r neues aber das ist eben das typische bild der sp die von professioneller und ehrlicher arbeit schlichtweg nichts versteht
7500943 der eu schwenk der sp bedeutet den tanz auf dem vulkan mit einer solchen vorgangsweise wird die sterreichische politik in europa nicht ernst genommen gerade die gro machtinteressen russlands haben in den letzten tagen wieder bewiesen dass wir eine starke eu und eine gute landesverteidigung brauchen mit boulevard populismus ist die neue lage nicht zu meistern
7500944 weil politik nicht nach dem gie kannenprinzip erfolgen darf schlagen wir vor allen pensionisten bis zu einer pensionsh he von 1 200 euro brutto pro monat einen teuerungsausgleich sprich eine einmalzahlung zus tzlich zur pensionserh hung zukommen zu lassen und zwar ungef hr in dem unfang den die bezieher niedriger einkommen durch die reduzierung der arbeitslosenversicherungsbeitr ge erhalten haben
7500945 das im ministerrat beschlossene paket ist ein guter erster schritt in die richtige richtung noch vor der wahl muss es unbedingt im nationalrat beschlossen werden danach muss der sterreich fonds teil einer umfassenden l sung f r den pflegebereich sein insgesamt muss die pflege ein fixer teil der gesundheitsversorgung werden was im zuge der anstehenden reformen umgesetzt werden soll
7500946 f r die muss es einfacher werden sich zu organisieren da brauchen wir bessere hilfestellungen beim urlaub von der pflege bei kurzzeitpflege bei betreutem wohnen und tageszentren
7500947 der sterreichische seniorenrat muss endlich als vollwertiger f nfter sozialpartner behandelt werden
7500948 diese ungl ckliche deckelung der pensionen die dazu f hrt dass pensionen ber der h he von 55 prozent der jeweiligen asvg h chstpension nur einen fixbetrag als erh hung erhalten muss endlich weg f r die diesj hrige pensionserh hung soll diese grenze zumindest auf die h he der asvg h chstpension angehoben werden langfristig muss sie abgeschafft werden weil auch mittelstand pensionisten ein recht auf valorisierung ihrer pensionen haben
7500949 derzeit m ssen neupensionisten bis zu 23 monate auf die erste anpassung ihrer pensionen warten das ist nicht einzusehen diese ungerechtigkeit ist zu beseitigen und zwar gleich im zuge der nun anstehenden verhandlungen
7500950 auch noch im zuge dieser verhandlungen werden wir mit dem sterreichischen seniorenrat darauf dr ngen dass die pensionssicherungsbeitr ge aller beamten abgeschafft werden vorerst zumindest bis zur h he der asvg h chstpension langfristig sollen diese beitr ge jedoch ebenfalls zur g nze gestrichen werden wir werden hier hartn ckig bleiben und alles tun um diese drei ziele auch zu erreichen
7500951 unser ziel ist eine steuerliche gleichbehandlung von aktiven und pensionisten durch die abschaffung der einschleifregelungen bei den pensionisten absetzbetr gen die ersten 200 bis 300 euro ber dem steuereingangssatz sollen dann mit nur 20 prozent besteuert werden dar ber soll dann ein steuersatz von 33 statt bisher 38 prozent zur anwendung kommen das w rde den pensionsbeziehern wirklich helfen
7500952 beim regress an angeh rigen von im heim gepflegten menschen ist das burgenland noch immer eines der drei schlusslichter zwar wurde die abschaffung angek ndigt bisher jedoch noch nicht endg ltig umgesetzt hier muss es eine l sung f r ganz sterreich geben weil hilfe und unterst tzung nicht abh ngig sein d rfen von wohnort familienstand oder einkommen
7500953 wenn in den n chsten jahren die umstellung der e card auf neue karten mit passbild erfolgt dann sollen gleich mehrere funktionen mit eingebaut werden die e card soll als pensionistenausweis verwendet werden k nnen es muss m glich sein patientenverf gungen auf der e card zu speichern und rezepte sollen in zukunft elektronisch ausgestellt werden

7500972 berbiete das die spiele von peking endeten so spektakul r wie sie begonnen haben
7500973 die bergabe hat mehr an die zeiten des swinging london als an die kosmopolitische finanzmetropole die sie heute ist erinnert wenn das ein statement der organisatoren war sich nicht mit der gr te und dem spektakel von peking zu messen sondern stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen so ist das empfehlenswert
7500974 wir sollten etwas skurril britisches bieten mit einem langanhaltenden erbe und ohne schrecklichen kater als die spiele von peking zu einem spektakul ren ende kamen gab londons b rgermeister boris johnson einen grellen vorgeschmack auf den individuellen stil der in vier jahren erwartet werden kann die schrullige show stand im kontrast zu der perfekt abgestimmten extravaganz der chinesen in gigantischen dimensionen au ergew hnlichen farb effekten einem bombardement von feuerwerk und atemberaubender artistik
7500975 london kann es nur mit einer kollektiven anstrengung schaffen und einem enthusiasmus den viele wom glich f r unzeitgem oder v llig unbritisch halten
7500976 als die nationalhymne gesungen war kam londons chance die welt zu beeindrucken wo peking auf unermessliche zahlen von darstellern setzte nutzte london seinen weltruf und die popul rkultur
7500977 au er den technischen dingen kann london nur sehr wenig von peking lernen nie wieder wird eine nation das geld und den politischen willen aufbringen um olympische spiele diesen ausma es hervorzubringen
7500978 wir m ssen es auf unsere weise tun der traum von london 2012 ist jetzt realit t geworden und in den n chsten vier jahren wird sich die bohrende aufmerksamkeit der welt nach gro britannien richten wenn wir irgendetwas von peking gelernt haben dann ist es nicht noch einmal zu versuchen was hier in china gemacht wurde f r diese spiele waren die kosten unz hlbar
7500979 wenn es irgendwelche zweifel gab dass die spiele 2012 in london anders sein werden als die in peking sind sie mit dem auftritt von londons b rgermeister boris johnson verschwunden ein frecher schuljunge unter erwachsenen
7500980 die ordnung und der pomp der er ffnungsfeier wurde ersetzt durch leichtigkeit frivolit t und spa die schlussfeier erinnerte an eine gigantische party
7500981 vom entz nden des olympischen feuers im vogelnest am 8 august bis zur schlussfeier diese spiele geh rten zu den erinnerungsw rdigsten und spektakul rsten berhaupt aber das berragende thema dieser spiele war kontrolle nach all den aufrufen zu frieden und harmonie nach all den hoffnungen die mit der vergabe der spiele an peking in sachen offenheit und menschenrechte verbunden waren hat es china nicht geschafft die erwartungen zu erf llen
7500982 die spiele waren ein zweifelhafter triumph f r china die welt bewunderte die organisation und die finanziellen mittel von den sportst tten bis zu den verschwenderischen zeremonien auf der anderen seite war es bei allem zu viel der organisation
7500983 fast perfekte organisation rekordflut legend re leistungen die ersten olympischen spiele in china waren ein gro er jahrgang der dem asiatischen riesen erlaubt hat seine kraft unter beweis zu stellen der aber auch die grenzen seiner toleranz aufgezeigt hat
7500984 china auf der ganzen linie siegreich die organisation war perfekt die opposition wurde erstickt und der sportliche erfolg hat sich eingestellt
7500985 china die neue supermacht der gastgeber hat die usa in der welthierarchie entthront auch wenn nicht alle legenden dieser spiele aus china kommen
7500986 china ein koloss mit 100 medaillen die schlussfeier hebt die sportlichen erfolge des landes hervor sie ist zwar informeller als die er ffnungszeremonie sie ist aber trotzdem magisch gigantisch und perfekt
7500987 die olympischen spiele sind zu ende und china ist ein bisschen n her ger ckt
7500988 das china der spiele siegt ber die menschenrechte die welt hat keine klare politische orientierung gezeigt welche china bei den menschenrechten zu einem politikwechsel zwingen k nnte man hat den chinesischen drachen nicht einmal durch fernbleiben bei der er ffnungsfeier in verlegenheit bringen wollen
7500989 rogge behauptet die internationale gemeinschaft habe etwas von china gelernt und china von der internationalen gemeinschaft angesichts der wiederholten schweren verst e gegen grundrechte wie pressefreiheit und meinungsfreiheit durch die chinesische regierung im rahmen der olympischen spiele ist die rede rogges eine schande f r den ioc
7500990 die gigantische sensations show die sommerspiele 2008 bertrafen alles was organisation ablauf und pr zision betrifft
7500991 bye bye peking eine farbenfrohe und stimmungsvolle abschlussfeier china hat zum abschluss der olympischen spiele noch einmal sein leistungsverm gen demonstriert

7501021 the wall covering sets the decorating theme white in the pattern and the curtains teams with the white fixtures there is good mirror lighting
7501022 venetian blinds in pale pink give light and privacy control blend with the wallcovering pattern and are simple to care for
7501023 colored fixtures and tile set the theme here with the bright red accent of the wallcovering design repeated in towels and the bath mat

7501025 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids

7501030 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7501031 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7501032 ever since atmel introduced the worlds first serial flash in 1997 we have been a consistent leader in serial flash memories and have continued to work diligently to align our product roadmaps with our customers ensuring that we define the right products to meet their future design needs
7501033 the at25df081 is a clear case in which we listened to our customers and developed a product that allows them to design their applications to be smaller lighter and last longer all at a lower cost and without sacrificing performance
7501034 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7501035 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7501036 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7501037 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7501038 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7501039 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7501040 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7501041 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7501042 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7501043 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7501044 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7501045 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7501046 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7501047 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7501048 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7501094 nuestra mano est tendida a la izquierda y a los nacionalistas
7501095 hay que arrimar el hombro no se trata de hacer oposici n oportunista y destructiva cuando el pa s necesita que su gobierno ponga en marcha un presupuesto como el que la situaci n econ mica reclama
7501096 hay un clamor en el pa s para que se alcancen acuerdos para combatir la situaci n econ mica atenci n a esto
7501097 se puede hacer un par ntesis entendiendo que hay buena voluntad y camino de negociaci n del modelo de financiaci n y previamente aprobar el presupuesto
7501098 la que es capaz de pensar en espa a y de corresponsabilizarse con su pol tica econ mica terrorista exterior
7501099 aislar la coyuntura pol tica vasca de una decisi n de corresponsabilidad para aprobar los presupuestos generales

7501108 no descarto la posibilidad de que pueda producirse un acuerdo

7501113 es l gico que si hay acuerdo en la financiaci n el acuerdo presupuestario sea m s posible y que si en el tema de la financiaci n el desencuentro es total pues el consenso en torno al presupuesto sea inalcanzable

7501121 if you cant say anything nice come sit by me
7501122 the beautiful part of writing is that you dont have to get it right the first time unlike say a brain surgeon
7501123 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not satisfaction in a good novel must be intolerably stupid

7501130 if your only other option is to be living on the street then having a room is pretty satisfying but we dont want that to read that its satisfactory and thats all they need
7501131 and when people say they would move away from the downtown eastside we dont want that to be used to show that theyd rather not be there its the housing theyre in it doesnt mean the area itself is not a community they want to be in
7501132 this experience has been checked off the list it isnt just that its over but also because it no longer belongs to the exclusive realm of the imagination and to be quite honest i think my imagination will miss it
7501133 nosotros lo que pedimos es informaci n por muy triste que sea

7501139 a star guarantees the first weekend box office and it is this business which decides all the other revenue streams
7501140 they are willing to pay a premium to establish themselves its the pressure to have big films under your belt
7501141 we needed to run a humongous number of independent jobs
7501142 one of our users had several million computations the advantage of having a large number of independent tasks is that you can farm them out anywhere but the teragrid had no real way to do that
7501143 and allowed researchers to spend a lot more time on the science and the computing rather than the management of the project
7501144 all the user has to worry about is submitting his own jobs into his own personal cluster
7501145 the user doesnt have to worry about the infrastructure or deal with the heterogeneous usage policies at the different supercomputing sites
7501146 what i really want to be able to do is just submit my job to the teragrid and have the scheduler send some jobs to tacc and some to pittsburgh supercomputing center to get my computation done as quickly as possible
7501147 its been said that the most profound software systems are those that disappear
7501148 the interface is the job management system that the user picks and as much as possible we want the user to not interact with the software mycluster is this transparent tool that goes out and does something for the user

7501176 we dont go out there to lose games and we should have won all of those games
7501177 i understand why people booed and its the worst thing that can happen we dont want to let people down again they deserve the best
7501178 but we cant go out there and panic now if we do that it will do more harm than good we were so close its a matter of carrying the ball so far and then the final pass or failure to secure a ball brings us back to the other side of the field
7501179 we are too rushed at the moment we have to be more composed when we click somebodys going to get a hiding

7501201 raccogliamo regolarmente segnalazioni di rifiuti nella concessione dei part time
7501202 sono quasi sempre donne che cercano un modo per non rinunciare completamente al lavoro retribuito
7501203 lo considerano pi costoso senza tener presente altri aspetti come la produttivit oraria che dopo un tot di ore tende a diminuire in realt i costi del part time sono principalmente organizzativi
7501204 lidea che concedere il part time comporti solo costi aggiuntivi per lazienda uno stereotipo
7501205 sono resistenze obsolete che non tengono in conto la crescita motivazionale che pu comportare una concessione alle esigenze di vita del lavoratore
7501206 diversi studi hanno dimostrato che il part time riduce lassenteismo e aumenta la produttivit
7501207 ci sono dei finanziamenti istituiti dal 2000 per le aziende che si organizzano in modo da facilitare la conciliazione lavoro famiglia ma poi questi soldi non li prende nessuno
7501208 part time pu significare anche solo riduzione di unora o due
7501209 non necessariamente lavorare met giornata le combinazioni possibili sono tante basta volersi organizzare alcuni modelli aziendali per esempio organizzano turni da sei ore senza la pausa pranzo e funzionano benissimo in genere se una persona viene organizzata bene in modo che non debba fare salti mortali per gestire lavoro e tutto il resto se la motivi bene poi rende moltissimo

7501211 un rapporto di lavoro povero che assomiglia di pi a una condizione di sottoccupazione con stipendi ridotti e analoghe conseguenze sul versante pensionistico
7501212 innanzi tutto la trappola di una segregazione occupazionale doppia il tempo ridotto attualmente si concentra in settori non qualificati e in mansioni escluse dalle prospettive di carriera
7501213 nei paesi dove il part time pi diffuso anche maggiore loccupazione femminile dunque utile per aumentare la partecipazione delle donne al mercato del lavoro nel nostro paese molto bassa
7501214 ma attenzione non pu essere questa lunica soluzione va comunque accompagnato da altri strumenti come lofferta di servizi di cura o i congedi parentali
7501215 i dati eurostat sulla distribuzione per fasce det mostrano che il part time pi diffuso tra le ragazze che tra le donne con carichi familiari da gestire cio dai 25 ai 54 anni
7501216 anche volendo il lavoratore part time non pu nemmeno cercarsi un altro impiego a tempo ridotto
7501217 perch spesso sottoposto a turnazioni molto variabili come si fa a organizzarsi con qualsiasi cosa dalla casa ai figli al secondo lavoro se i turni cambiano in continuazione

7501221 pure bar is a great complementary strategic fit with the promax brand portfolio said promax president tim welch
7501222 since acquiring promax in 2006 we have been looking to expand our product offerings to natural foods and have met with literally dozens of companies
7501223 we found many interesting products but none that we felt had the potential to become a major brand until meeting veronica and seeing what she had accomplished with pure bar in less than two years

7501237 gostar amos de trazer o ouro mas milh es de atletas competem se preparam por quatro anos e quem n o trouxe nenhuma medalha est bem mais chateado que n s o brasil n o conquistava uma no futebol desde 96 sabemos que foi feito tudo o que era poss vel mas tem v rias coisas a se destacar trabalhamos apenas 15 dias na hora da viagem n o sabia com que atletas poderia contar nada era claro em termos de libera o toca o telefone s tr s da manh e n o sabia quem poderia escalar ou n o na hora de entrar em campo chega uma carta dizendo que se o time jogasse com a camisa oficial teria um monte de problemas imagina a press o os jogadores est o de parab ns porque suportaram tudo
7501238 os jogadores se comprometeram tiveram atitude postura personalidade e car ter pode ser que alguns pessoas n o estejam contentes porque n o tem pol mica na sele o os atletas tiveram todo esse tempo sem folga alguns brigaram com seus clubes para estar na sele o e pagaram multa 25 mil cerca de r 60 mil por dia para ficar em pequim n o era esse esp rito que se queria no brasil estamos criando e vai ser assim at o final somos firmes porque sabemos da for a e postura deste grupo
7501239 os clubes n o liberavam profissionais acima de 23 anos e n o tem como voc no caso a cbf brigar com o clube eu sempre vou pensar no bem da sele o sem levar em conta problemas pessoais atitudes o que for para o bem do brasil vou fazer cada um tem o seu direito de querer ou n o defender a sele o s falar claro que vai ter um momento que o jogador n o vai estar bem n o vai querer vir e a gente tem que respeitar mas o mais importante a sele o a gente tem que renovar trazer quem quer important ssima a individualidade n o se faz nada sem ela mas o coletivo que a sustenta

7501241 it would save the system a lot of money because i wouldnt have to redo things
7501242 this allows real time investigation of medications patients are taking right at the bedside
7501243 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7501244 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7501245 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7501246 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7501247 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7501248 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7501249 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7501250 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7501251 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7501252 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7501253 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7501254 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7501255 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7501256 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7501257 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7501258 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7501259 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7501260 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7501261 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7501262 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7501263 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7501264 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7501265 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7501266 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7501267 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7501268 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7501269 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7501270 small value and small blend have certainly held up better year to date mostly in recent times
7501271 when you have a big drop any recovery can seem large
7501272 i think if you take it and just assume that all small caps are doing better or will do better i think you can get trapped
7501273 it doesnt have the feel of a normal bottom of the market and a lot of the stocks arent selling for prices that you find at the bottom
7501274 youre going to want to put a premium on a managers skill and lower expenses and a sensible strategy and anything else you would look for in any other fund
7501275 this is not an environment that small cap companies should be doing well in fundamentally i dont think its there and from that aspect we do think its early to get into the game of overweighting something like a small cap
7501276 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
7501277 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7501278 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7501279 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7501280 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7501281 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
7501282 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
7501283 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
7501284 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
7501285 being on fox is like going into the second room
7501286 is in all the schools in the country it just hasnt manifested itself yet young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music
7501287 and you should see what happens on columbus day when the native americans mix it up with the italians now thats a real problem

7501290 eine prozession westlicher kriegsschiffe dampft durch den bosporus ins schwarze meer um hilfsg ter nach georgien zu transportieren
7501291 a top russian general accused nato on saturday of using humanitarian aid deliveries to georgia as
7501292 under the cover of needing to deliver humanitarian goods nato countries continue to boost their naval grouping
7501293 in addition to the spanish and german frigates that entered the black sea basin on august 21 yesterday a polish frigate and a destroyer of the us navy passed the bosphorous
7501294 i dont think that this will help stabilise the situation in the region
7501295 ein hoher russischer general hat die nato am samstag bezichtigt humanit re hilfsg terlieferungen nach georgien als vorwand f r den aufbau von flottenpr senz im schwarzen meer zu verwenden
7501296 unter dem schutz der notwendigkeit humanit re hilfsg ter zu liefern fahren die nato l nder fort ihre konzentration von kriegsschiffen im schwarzen meer zu vergr ern
7501297 zus tzlich zu der deutschen und der spanischen fregatte er h lt das spanische kommandoschiff f r eine fregatte aber es handelt sich um einen extrem modernen lenkwaffen zerst rer mit stealth eigenschaften die am 21 august in das schwarze meer fuhren haben gestern 22 august eine polnische fregatte und ein zerst rer der us marine den bosporus passiert
7501298 ich glaube nicht das wird die situation in der region stabilisieren

7501300 i think there were a lot of controversial decisions during the game
7501301 obviously i cant say a great deal about referees because of the respect campaign and i dont want to get fined
7501302 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7501303 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7501304 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7501305 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7501306 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7501307 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7501308 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7501313 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
7501314 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
7501315 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
7501316 its common sense that you want to have a secure border
7501317 we want to allow people in who do it the right way through a regimented and legal process
7501318 of course no one wants people to be coming here illegally
7501319 undocumented immigrants themselves want to stop illegal immigration even immigrants rights groups will tell you we dont want illegal immigration
7501320 many of the jobs we are losing are not due to undocumented immigrants theyre a result of the globalized market
7501321 under financial pressure and with a lack of work opportunities
7501322 i still recall those moments when the emir started thanking god and congratulating me for the choice of my wife to become the martyr i recalled the years i spent in the army away from my family and the hardships sumaya suffered providing for the family needs i recalled all these memories while the emir was telling me to recite the quran as many times as possible and to prepare my wife for the attack
7501323 this was a crucial test after which i decided to walk away
7501324 when the emir asked my husband to bring me with him i thought that these people wanted to benefit from the nature of my work as a teacher in order to collect information on the area and its people but i was surprised to be the one chosen for the attack
7501325 i am obliged to choose the one who is most capable of hiding her load of ammunition
7501326 do not worry about them we will guarantee their future
7501327 security forces have recorded 79 attacks by women suicide bombers since the us entry into iraq in april 2003
7501328 the last two months have witnessed seven suicide bombings by women three were carried out in one day targeting a group of shiite visitors to the al karadah area in baghdad and the latest was an attack by a 15 years old girl an investigation confirmed that the girl was intoxicated when she carried out the attack
7501329 al qaeda has succeeded in mobilizing women suffering from poverty and ignorance as well as widowed women to become suicide bombers in some cases belts containing explosive materials have been given to women in order to be delivered to certain people in return for a large sum of money the explosives carried by these women were then detonated using a remote control device sometimes street girls not yet 18 years old have been recruited
7501330 the free mobility of women who do not undergo inspection by police and army checkpoints thus it is easier for them to carry out such attacks
7501331 hahaha we destroyed the hopes and 4 18 dreams of a generation of faux romantics
7501332 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
7501333 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
7501334 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
7501335 steers patients who dont have private insurance primarily poor black people to other health care facilities
7501336 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions
7501337 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
7501338 the one thing that could re create the west is russia acting in opposition to the west nato had lost its way the russians have created a situation which gives nato a raison detre again to contain russia
7501339 there was no nato meeting no eu meeting the russians assume there are divisions and they are right
7501340 theres no unity at all within europe the newer eu countries are far more anti russian than the older ones
7501341 of course many countries like germany and italy that buy their oil and gas from russia they have to worry that if the relationship deteriorates it will have an impact on their economy
7501342 the way it unfolds in germany will be tremendously important because germany is an in between country
7501343 during the cold war europe always had a more moderate position than the united states had a more pragmatic position just for reasons of geographic proximity and because europe tends to have a more pragmatic policy than the u s

7501364 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7501365 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7501366 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7501367 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7501368 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7501369 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7501370 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7501408 catholics can receive the indulgence during two time frames pilgrims visiting the massabielle grotto where mary appeared to st bernadette can receive the indulgence during the lourdes jubilee year which runs from dec 8 the feast of the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin mary until dec 8 2008 pilgrims who visit any public sanctuary shrine or other worthy place dedicated to our lady of lourdes may receive the indulgence feb 2 11 feb 11 is the day the first of 18 apparitions occurred and is the feast of our lady of lourdes feb 2 is the feast of the presentation of the lord
7501409 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
7501410 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
7501411 he that believeth on him jesus is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
7501412 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
7501413 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
7501414 it is not a permission to commit sin nor a pardon of future sin neither could be granted by any power it is not the forgiveness of the guilt of sin it supposes that the sin has already been forgiven least of all is an indulgence the purchase of a pardon which secures the buyers salvation or releases the soul of another from purgatory
7501415 on the contrary it means a more complete payment of the debt which the sinner owes to god
7501416 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god
7501417 has to already be a christian to receive an indulgence
7501418 god is also a just god and therefore the individual while forgiven still faces a penalty for the transgression if there wasnt then god would not be just
7501419 i read this nowhere in the scriptures the christianity of which the bible speaks is one of certainty and confidence not one which leaves the individual in doubt as to whether they are going to face a penalty for a certain transgression
7501420 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
7501421 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement or punishment of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
7501422 what advantage then hath the jew or what profit is there of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god
7501423 he that believeth on him jesus is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
7501424 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
7501425 salvation is a gift that is offered by god you dont work for a gift you dont earn it its free and it is yours for the taking if you have not already taken it by repentance and faith in christ
7501426 for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ
7501427 if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed
7501428 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us

7501442 the vote that is left to get is a vote that loves hillary clinton
7501443 im wondering what plans they have to rig the general election
7501444 i thought i hated bush but that is nothing like the way i feel about this creep
7501445 it was a heartbreaker because we were leading 1 0 and had pat osburn pitching for us a real good lefthanded pitcher
7501446 we got a fantastic reception when we came back with a police escort and everything as a young kid it was quite impressive
7501447 we had a real good coach in jack i think he had played pro baseball so he knew the game and pretty much treated us like pro ball players he just put us out there and let us play he was an aggressive coach and we learned a lot from him
7501448 we had mac scarce out of the bullpen when we brought him in he was automatic hed just shut guys down and he later pitched in the majors we had an all american second baseman dick nichols there was ronnie cash harry saferight and doug kasimier im leaving out guys but the whole team was excellent and i was real proud to be part of it
7501449 oh yeah they had dave kingman jim barr and steve busby id love to see it on tape because i thought it was one of the best cws games every played
7501450 ive been watching them on tv and pulling for them i was real happy they advanced on to omaha and it looks like they have a real good offensive team and im impressed with some of the pitchers mike martins done a real good job with them they look like a real good ball club i wish them well hopefully they can take it all the way and win one for florida state
7501451 whitehurst ive got a lot of respect for you son
7501452 we were ahead 26 12 at the half and then tommy warren qb dislocated his shoulder and didnt tell coach henning offensive coordinator dan henning so he was throwing wounded ducks out in the flats and they kept intercepting for touchdowns and on the third one that was going for a touchdown the guy nick holm came down our sideline and bill parcells said somebody oughta get him and i go i got him coach so i held onto parcells arm and reached out just as far as i could i had to lean way out there to get him with my foot to trip him so i didnt even think i just did it on impulse
7501453 well we wound up losing the game 53 21 one of the worst defeats we had in ten years or so but coach peterson said he felt like doing it himself and parcellss reaction was at least i know hes paying attention so they didnt give me a real hard time about it
7501454 i guess it would be the inaugural fiesta bowl we couldnt stop danny white and arizona state and parcells was openly weeping after the game he just couldnt get the defenses right and danny white just picked us apart it wasnt lack of effort he knew it was coaching so thats why he was so upset after the game note fsus gary huff threw for 347 yards and two tds in a seesaw battle won by asu 45 38
7501455 jones kept the assistant coaches so it didnt change too much except that parcells kind of ran the show he was a dominating kind of guy larry was a good coach too a good organizer but he didnt have an aggressive personality like parcells did
7501456 he could make it difficult for you back then making the practices long and hard probably more so than now but he was just a prince of a guy i mean a great coach and a great friend i actually handled his gadsden county farm for him when he came back to tallahassee and id gotten into the real estate business you know all that stuff where people made fun of coach pete he was so smart but he had a hard time with cliches and got crossed up once in awhile but he was a gentleman and quite a man
7501457 wayne mcduffie and gene mcdowell were about as hard nosed as they come gene was my freshman coach and we had like 110 players come out and we ran 43 forty yard sprints that first practice and seven guys quit that first day
7501458 today i think theyve gotta pick the intensity level back up i heard the off season program got the intensity back kids now theyre just more talented than we were but i dont think theyd put up with the verbal abuse we had back in those days
7501459 rhett dawson was the best leader we had he was a receiver and led by performance i dont think he really got credit for his leadership and what he did like leading us to the fiesta bowl in 71 but he was my best friend then and still is
7501460 id watched the team all through the 60s i knew florida state was on the way up and i wanted to be part of that program i think people have kinda forgotten about the glory days of the 60s and up through 71 when we went to that first fiesta bowl but thats what put florida state on the map i was recruited real hard by a lot of big universities including alabama and notre dame but i just never considered anything but florida state
7501461 i had a short stay with the new england patriots in chuck fairbanks first year there he came from oklahoma in 73 i was on the payroll for about a year and a half but then i got into real estate and was making more money than i was playing football which would hardly be the case these days the average salary back then was a lot lower than it is now
7501462 i was glad to be a part of it and still love all those guys that i played with and am real proud to be a letterman there
7501463 a few of my white friends have asked me with barack achieving all of this will we be in a position where we can put race aside
7501464 we had an attitude we walked out there and said theyre not gonna stop
7501465 we had an attitude we walked out there and said theyre not gonna stop
7501466 we made a terrible error at the end of the alabama game when we took a safety
7501467 then alabama had good field position they only had one play i think and then kicked their field goal
7501468 before we took the safety though we made a first down and it was bedlam
7501469 and i remember we started eight true freshmen against alabama
7501470 we took over a program that was really in disarray they didnt even have five pounds of weight our weight coach went down to deland and picked up a bunch of nautilus machines and we stared a weight program
7501471 the other factor when i went to florida state the players lived in kind of a den of iniquity at cash hall
7501472 i think in our second year we lost five games by 15 points we thought wed probably win eight games the next year 1976 i remember bobby bowden in his book he said he thought wed have won more games than he did in 76 he ended up with a losing season his first year
7501473 later bobby bowden invited my team back and he told all my players that he thought our team the second team that we had there in 1975 really turned the program around
7501474 sure i enjoy the memory of the wonderful 64 season but its the people me and freddy and steve and george dallessandro and phil spooner and terry gavin and dale mackenzie and tom west and jack edwards we all came in as coach petersons first recruiting class and we just had a bond as a freshmen team we were cocky we believed in each other we liked each other and we just knew we could be good and the journey with those guys and coach peterson the coaches that we really enjoyed winning that gator bowl in 64 was the destination but if you dont enjoy the journey then you really cant enjoy the rest of it
7501475 i moved into my room waiting to see who my roommate would be and its this gangly 6 foot 5
7501476 bill peterson hired incredible coaches for his staff and by good fortune we ended up with a very good group of players that were really tight personally and physically talented to make a mark for themselves along the way we found we had one of the most entertaining and colorful coaches you could ever have his misuse of the english language was classic and we looked forward to every meeting because we never knew what we were going to hear the great thing is you never have to exaggerate just tell the truth and its automatically a good story
7501477 coach pete was very intense about his desire to win
7501478 the focus at florida state is bobby bowden but bill peterson is the one who put it on the map he was an innovator in college football to throw the ball the way we did and i think he deserves a lot of credit for what he did at that time and you match that with the quality coaching and good caliber athletes and shoot we hit and just had a bunch of fun doing it
7501479 i just think that coach bowden was another example of bill petersons greatest quality which was his ability to pick assistant coaches along with don james whos a legendary college coach we had john coatta who went on to be head coach at wisconsin and don powell the offensive line coach and one of the best ive ever witnessed after i left there were bill parcells joe gibbs and dan henning
7501480 an incredible experience because at that time florida didnt want to play florida state i just remember pre game in the locker room avery sumner got up and appealed to the team that we needed to win this game because he thought he could get a grade in a certain course if we won the game and he needed the grades he made everybody laugh and we went out and played well that put us on the map as the real deal and a team florida had to pay attention to
7501481 but just as memorable the kentucky game that year they came to town after some big wins and at that time we had the magnificent seven defensive front that all shaved their heads and shutout a few people and the coaches said if they shut out kentucky theyd shave their heads and by gosh we killed em we had them shut out until right at the end of the game and our starters wanted to go back in and keep the shut out kentucky scored at the end but we won decisively
7501482 it was enjoyable short and it bridged the gap between college football and going into coaching playing with the patriots was a thrill we played at
7501483 then i drifted into coaching i never intended on coaching but i must have liked it because i did it a long time
7501484 when i first coached in college i worked for johnny majors for eleven years he was the head coach at iowa state and pittsburgh where we won a national championship and then tennessee i credit coach majors for developing me into a well rounded coach he forced us to learn about every aspect of the game so when i had the opportunity to join jimmy johnson with the cowboys in 1990 id been an offensive line coach and offensive coordinator my whole career but id always been involved in the kicking game so i felt comfortable taking that job and i bounced into a great situation that took us to three championships in a four year period the first team ever to do that and i just rode the coattails of some great players and we got three rings out of it
7501485 we had an attitude we walked out there and said theyre not gonna stop
7501486 cuando sembramos en un conuco la cosecha no puede ser muy abundante
7501487 you need to find a job where they will take you on as you are
7501488 sometimes you have to tell the boss the truth sometimes thats good

7501490 we dont see a lot of americans wanting to come and take these positions
7501491 these people didnt take the jobs they were jobs americans didnt want to take
7501492 the concept of making employers into policemen and putting a wedge between employers and employees is nonsense
7501493 the employer wants to protect the workforce the department of homeland security wants to deport the workforce
7501494 it is very expensive if they came down and cited us for having undocumented employees its jail terms
7501495 the financial risk is enormous until we decide its important to educate our children and give them vocational skills these people are the only ones that are coming able to do this work

7501516 world trade negotiators need to bounce back quickly from a failed meeting in july to have any chance of reaching a deal by the end of the year the head of the world trade organization said on friday
7501517 the good news is that they want to re engage wto director general pascal lamy said in an interview referring to india and the united states whose differences on agriculture led to the collapse of world trade talks last month in geneva
7501518 lamy spoke to reuters after meeting on friday with u s trade representative susan schwab and several u s industry groups including the national association of manufacturers and the u s chamber of commerce
7501519 earlier this month he traveled to new delhi to explore indias interest in restarting negotiations
7501520 i think thats the view of the bush administration lamy said its also the view by others that the more time passes the more the ability of an administration to contract a deal diminishes he said
7501521 some wto members suspect the real reason talks collapsed last month was because the united states did not want to deal with developing country demands for deeper and faster cuts in
7501522 i know there are a lots of conspiracy theories running on this to be frank i dont suspect the u s broke on the ssm special safeguard mechanism not to have cotton on the table they know cotton has to be there as part of the deal lamy said
7501523 susan schwab us trade representative yesterday warned that it was premature to say whether the doha round of multilateral trade talks could be revived after their collapse in geneva at the end of july
7501524 while ms schwab said the us was still committed to doha she was cautious as senior negotiators below ministerial level prepare to meet again in early september to pick up the pieces and try to find a new path towards an agreement
7501525 it is much too early to tell ms schwab told the ft shortly after a meeting that ran longer than expected with pascal lamy director general of the world trade organization
7501526 critics of the us stance in doha have argued that it has not been willing to make sufficient concessions particularly on farm subsidies but
7501527 u s trade representative susan schwab said on friday that serious negotiations in world trade talks should resume in september to see whether a deal is still possible this year
7501528 there are quite a number of outstanding issues and therefore i encouraged the director general to convene senior officials sooner rather than later schwab told reporters by telephone after a meeting with world trade organization director general pascal lamy
7501529 schwab said a deal in the nearly seven year old doha round of world trade talks was still conceivable this year despite a major collapse in the negotiations last month in geneva
7501530 indias role in the latest collapse has raised skepticism in the u s business community that new delhi is really interested in a deal
7501531 schwab did not address that directly but said perhaps the most important purpose of a meeting of senior officials would be to give us a chance to test the seriousness of purpose of key players whether they are there to engage and solve problems or whether its just a superficial political exercise
7501532 the united states is prepared to go to geneva with new ideas for resolving the safeguard issue and other outstanding concerns schwab said
7501533 brazil is resuming action at the world trade organization wto to take retaliatory trade measures against the united states over subsidies it pays its cotton farmers the foreign minister said on friday
7501534 we are sending a petition to geneva wto headquarters to request the resumption of the arbitration process which had been interrupted in relation to cotton celso amorim told reporters for brazil to seek up to 4 billion in trade sanctions on u s imports but the brazilian government had not pursued applying the sanctions in the hope of hammering out a deal through the doha round of trade talks which have since collapsed
7501535 amorim said the country would also look more closely at possible action over u s tariffs on imports of the latin american nations sugar cane derived ethanol biofuel
7501536 we also have to examine the ethanol question a consensus is mounting that we should go down this road a trade dispute but were still working with lawyers and checking the law he said
7501537 brazil is asking the world trade organization to outline the sort of sanctions it can impose against the u s to retaliate for american cotton subsidies
7501538 foreign minister celso amorim on friday said he had asked his nations representative to the wto to request that body define the value of the retaliation brazil might apply
7501539 more disputes are expected in the world trade organization wto after the doha round failed brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said friday
7501540 brazil considered the u s cotton subsidies unfair because they squeezed the farmers in developing countries out of the market amorim said at a press conference
7501541 wto had adopted a final ruling of the dispute in june and arbitrators should estimate an amount of sanctions
7501542 though we prefer to settle disputes by negotiations brazil is still considering starting another dispute against the united states over the trade barriers on brazilian ethanol amorim said
7501543 major food makers are quietly altering their recipes on candy dairy products and other top selling lines adding fillers and substituting cheaper ingredients to cut costs amid the commodities boom
7501544 food makers face not only rising shipping costs due to costlier fuel but also sizeable jumps in the price of wheat sugar and other basic ingredients
7501545 food commodity prices had retreated somewhat in july but on friday the dow jones aig agricultural sub index which charts futures prices of crops ranging from corn to coffee closed 7 7 higher for the week
7501546 only a few months ago some economists still offered hope that robust expansion could continue in much of the world even as the united states slowed
7501547 now high energy prices financial systems crippled by fear and the decline of trading partners have combined to choke growth in many major economies the international monetary fund expects global growth to slow significantly through the end of this year dipping to 4 1 percent from 5 percent in 2007
7501548 there is a potentially significant upside to the downturn under way it could knock down rising prices for food and energy which have been driven higher by swelling demand in a swiftly expanding world economy
7501549 the chairman of the federal reserve ben s bernanke has been betting on that very scenario as he has rejected calls for higher interest rates to suffocate inflation
7501550 the recent drop in commodity prices combined with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year mr bernanke said friday at the feds annual economic symposium in jackson hole wyo
7501551 the dollar has been strengthening against many currencies in recent weeks not because of a newfound belief in american prospects economists say but because investors are edging out of markets that are weakening like britain and other parts of europe sending down the pound and the euro
7501552 its the rest of the world going down not the united states going up said kenneth s rogoff a former chief economist at the international monetary fund and now a professor at harvard
7501553 a stronger dollar makes american goods more expensive on world markets if the dollar keeps strengthening it could pinch sales
7501554 u s wheat futures were the bulls darling in the spring as prices soared to all time highs in the wake of global crop failures but the grain probably wont be invited to any parties this fall
7501555 wheat quickly became a wallflower when farmers expanded plantings worldwide to take advantage of lofty prices after a quick retreat the market was left sandwiched between bearish forecasts of record global production and bullishness about steady export demand but demand appears anything but steady importers are expected to back off on purchases once they replenish supplies drained last year during the price run up and widespread production problems u s prices should slip along with demand
7501556 the world is expected to grow more wheat than ever this year with the global crop pegged at a record 670 8 million tons thats up nearly 10 from last year according to the agriculture department
7501557 the u s should see solid demand from countries seeking high quality wheat at least until it becomes clear whether australia will have a milling quality crop analysts say production is expected to rebound down under this year after two years of severe dryness
7501558 across the country from grain elevator to grain elevator golden wheat and corn are piled in towering mounds waiting for a rail car to haul them to market
7501559 some grain can sit for a month or more on the ground exposed to wind rain and rats
7501560 its the dark side of the booming global demand for u s corn wheat and soybeans the surge in exports is revealing inefficiencies in the countrys railways highways and rivers that carry the grain that helps feed the world and those bottlenecks are costing farmers shippers and ultimately consumers millions of dollars a year
7501561 the common agricultural policy has done much over 40 years to assure consumers of food supplies and give farmers a reasonable living
7501562 in 2003 protracted negotiations labelled as a mid term review of the cap resulted in moves to amalgamate about a dozen separate subsidy schemes for farmers into a unified
7501563 that suited the scottish farming industry but brussels has since shown a determination to cut direct support for farming and divert a large element of the funding towards environmental measures and it has decreed that the sfp should be subject to modulation on a progressively increasing scale set to see payments for most farmers reduced by as much as 22 per cent by 2012
7501564 the scale of these businesses is considerable but one leading operator made it clear that he would have to review his future strategy
7501565 but it would be relatively easy to divide up a large operation the senior farming partner could hive off a sizeable acreage to his sons or even to his wife always provided it can be proved that they have sufficient farming experience
7501566 lawyers and accountants will gain considerable fees but that will be small beer in the overall business perspective compared to the prospect of losing huge payments
7501567 it was nice to get out there and get some runs today
7501568 the plan was to bat as long as possible without putting any pressure on myself the plan worked and i am obviously pleased
7501569 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
7501570 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened

7501573 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy
7501574 did we play at our best i say no and so we have to look at why
7501575 we had problems to win our first few games last year but we won them this year we did not win that is the reality we had 60 minutes to come back on fulham and we did not do it
7501576 is that down to fulham s quality or the fact we were not good enough only the future will tell us that
7501577 i really enjoyed my first season here it was great bath is a fantastic rugby city too
7501578 there is no other club in england that i would consider i am very happy with the coaches and the team and i think bath are really capable of going somewhere great
7501579 it is obviously terrific for the club that michael has decided to stay especially signing so early in the season
7501580 developed severe allergies to the dog the family is heartbroken as they say hes a sweet wonderful dog hes great with people including children and hes house trained scubas only issue is that hes cat aggressive
7501581 going back to school expenses along with everything else have really tapped her out
7501582 but i decided to pay for delilahs vet visit with my utility bill money
7501583 extremely thin dehydrated very weak and his wounds were much worse we believe he was attacked by something we helped him into the car and poor thing was nervous as he stood most of the way with his legs trembling from weakness
7501584 to a breeder somewhere we have no idea how he found his way out on such a lonely backroad other than the obvious he was dumped there
7501585 they were both wagging their tails and i was crying again this time tears of joy
7501586 from the looks of both of them we are going to have them a while before they can go up for adoption
7501587 would give us the 1 5 million that we need to build an adjoining hospital so we could care for these animals properly right now in this shelter we have five broken legs four fhos femoral hip ostectomy fifteen heartworm positive dogs a kitty with half a face her face looked like that greyhounds shoulder when she came in she is doing much better now and three amputees
7501588 paid 250 to get the babies out of a bad situation had them checked by a vet they are doing great one speaks some words mainly in spanish the other one purrs like a kitten would like to recoup some moneys and find them a good home will come with cage and toys asking 200 obo
7501589 more importantly it will be one less worry for sharon and it will allow her to focus 100 percent on guiding her father down the long road towards recovery
7501590 in good shape they are very friendly and curious ive picked up most of them and they purr and otherwise dont seem too skittish
7501591 ive have been told they made it out alive thank you for spreading the word
7501592 a lady showed up at my door she had this boy in her car
7501593 so here he is he is not neutered but seems ok with my dogs as he walked through my house he just looked at my cats
7501594 who is very active in rescue and dedicated to golden retriever rescue was out to dinner late the other night and found a little female puppy running back and forth across the highway
7501595 some non caring human dropped off a pregnant dog at our house abut 3 months ago she had 8 puppies and after 7 weeks we found homes for all of them
7501596 we have been feeding her for over three months now and she is still somewhat afraid of people
7501597 giving some signs that she is improving she sometimes dances around and wiggles her tail like she is excited when i go to feed her so i think if someone works with her daily she will come around
7501598 este um cargo de confian a e a pergunta sobre eu continuar tem que ser feita ao presidente ricardo teixeira falo com ele diariamente e vou seguir o trabalho como ele pediu estou tranq ilo n o h mudan a de planos talvez voc s estejam acostumados com quem se preocupa com cargo e eu n o penso nisso quando falei que tinha a vida resolvida levaram para o lado financeiro mas n o por a quest o de realizar um trabalho nunca procurei emprego e sim trabalho por isso tive bons resultados quem procura emprego logo fica sem ele
7501599 gostar amos de trazer o ouro mas milh es de atletas competem se preparam por quatro anos e quem n o trouxe nenhuma medalha est bem mais chateado que n s o brasil n o conquistava uma no futebol desde 96 sabemos que foi feito tudo o que era poss vel mas tem v rias coisas a se destacar trabalhamos apenas 15 dias na hora da viagem n o sabia com que atletas poderia contar nada era claro em termos de libera o toca o telefone s tr s da manh e n o sabia quem poderia escalar ou n o na hora de entrar em campo chega uma carta dizendo que se o time jogasse com a camisa oficial teria um monte de problemas imagina a press o os jogadores est o de parab ns porque suportaram tudo
7501600 os jogadores se comprometeram tiveram atitude postura personalidade e car ter pode ser que alguns pessoas n o estejam contentes porque n o tem pol mica na sele o os atletas tiveram todo esse tempo sem folga alguns brigaram com seus clubes para estar na sele o e pagaram multa 25 mil cerca de r 60 mil por dia para ficar em pequim n o era esse esp rito que se queria no brasil estamos criando e vai ser assim at o final somos firmes porque sabemos da for a e postura deste grupo
7501601 os clubes n o liberavam profissionais acima de 23 anos e n o tem como voc no caso a cbf brigar com o clube eu sempre vou pensar no bem da sele o sem levar em conta problemas pessoais atitudes o que for para o bem do brasil vou fazer cada um tem o seu direito de querer ou n o defender a sele o s falar claro que vai ter um momento que o jogador n o vai estar bem n o vai querer vir e a gente tem que respeitar mas o mais importante a sele o a gente tem que renovar trazer quem quer important ssima a individualidade n o se faz nada sem ela mas o coletivo que a sustenta
7501602 falo a verdade sempre doa a quem doer desde que cheguei aqui me criticaram falaram que eu n o queria a b ou c e at agora um n o est jogando cita o indireta a kak essa a minha forma de trabalhar n o tenho que falar o que as pessoas querem ouvir e sim a verdade e s vezes no caminho a gente se machuca por isso

7501607 n o existe material dispon vel para o professor e isso precisar ser criado porque sem forma o e sem material did tico n o h possibilidade de dar certo
7501608 n o acho que haja algu m irrespons vel o bastante na comunidade internacional para aceitar isso
7501609 acho que uma falta grave de uma tentativa de mudar as fronteiras da europa por meio da for a ter resultados desastrosos inclusive para a r ssia
7501610 uma invas o cl ssica que n o t m nada a ver com o direito internacional tentam matar o direito das na es

7501612 era um territ rio sem import ncia para a r ssia
7501613 inclusive quando come ou a aumentar a tens o ali achei que podia conter tudo cometi essa falta porque pensei que o ataque principal seria na abkh zia n o que os russos pudessem atacar tbilisi

7501628 i have discovered that he is a compassionate and caring person
7501629 hardeep also gives freely of his time and financial support to many worthwhile civic and charitable causes that are too numerous to list
7501630 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7501631 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7501632 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7501633 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7501634 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7501635 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7501636 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7501637 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7501638 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7501639 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7501640 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7501641 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7501642 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7501643 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7501644 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7501645 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7501646 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7501647 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7501648 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7501649 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7501650 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7501651 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7501652 the best line i ever read from you was about me this was after the glory days in 1993 when we were all beat up dutch daulton inky pete incaviglia head dave hollins me we had no chance you knew it anyone who had a clue about baseball knew it the column was in the middle of spring training you wrote and the phillies will have lenny dykstra masquerading in centerfield one more year for some reason that made me laugh so hard because you were so right
7501653 vejo 198 her is estamos felizes por sua liberta o mas ainda temos tristeza em nossos cora es porque ainda h onze mil detidos em pris es israelenses

7501664 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7501665 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7501666 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7501667 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7501668 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7501669 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7501670 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7501671 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7501672 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7501673 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7501674 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7501675 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7501676 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7501677 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7501678 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7501679 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7501680 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7501681 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7501682 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7501683 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7501684 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7501685 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7501686 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7501687 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7501688 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7501689 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7501690 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7501691 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7501692 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7501693 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7501694 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7501695 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7501696 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7501697 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7501698 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7501699 he died did you send flowers to his wife dated her for a while
7501700 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7501701 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7501702 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7501703 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7501704 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7501705 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7501706 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7501707 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7501708 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7501709 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7501710 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7501711 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7501712 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7501713 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7501714 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7501715 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7501716 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7501717 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7501718 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7501719 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7501720 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7501721 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7501722 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7501723 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7501724 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7501725 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7501726 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7501727 this is a planning took where all things are going
7501728 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7501729 when israel frees prisoners to weak elements without demanding anything in return they remain weak
7501730 this is a decision conveying weakness and an acceptance of the existing situation
7501731 market participants may have recently focused on the somewhat improved outlook for inflation in the coming quarters
7501732 but for now actual cpix data are likely to show a further acceleration
7501733 the weakening leg has started and is likely to gain momentum on the publication of strong consumer price figures this week despite their lack of significance in terms of the monetary policy
7501734 the forex market will not pay attention to short term developments on the inflation front on the bond front however high inflation might be the necessary catalyst to kick the correction into overdrive
7501735 while the commodity price cycle has cooled off of late we expect further price increases at the factory gate

7501741 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7501742 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

7501749 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7501750 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7501751 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

7501753 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7501754 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7501755 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7501756 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7501757 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7501758 seize the momentum from the convention to bring millions of new voices into the political process
7501759 maybe they figure that theres enough earned media going on that they dont have to pay for anything
7501760 obama for president why not learn more about john mccain for president
7501761 at a minimum search engine ads make a lot of sense because this is the time when people are going online more than ever to find information about politics
7501762 thursday august 28th will be the biggest night of the campaign so far even if you cant be in denver you can be a part of this historic convention by attending a convention watch party in your area
7501763 i n terms of making the actual events more engaging theyre probably spending more time worrying about the timing of the balloon drop

7501767 the chinese set up three parks for protests but the permitting process was so cumbersome no permits were issued that i am aware of
7501768 it has been very quiet with the occasional tibetan banner flag i have a vpn that allows me to see anything i want but i have not heard of any new more aggressive censorship its just the same old whack a mole approach theyve consistently employed
7501769 this is like a mouth with a tongue cut off it does not matter how wide the mouth is opened because you can only hear some unclear moaning sounds
7501770 yes it would be overkill to find an earthquake orphan to ignite the flame and it would also be against many political considerations
7501771 but why not have one minute of silence before declaring the opening of the olympics almost 100 000 lives were lost three months ago and they dont deserve a minute of silence does the introduction of the earthquake factor based upon humanitarian reasons ruin the celebrative mood is the exhibition of mourning during the olympics embarrassing to china
7501772 is it just a variety show that is westernised but produced better than the west can
7501773 the more i watched the more i felt that is shallow and overplayed this opening ceremony showed the strength of china but it did not show chinese culture over the next two weeks or so the chinese people will feel great that they have finally stood up but after the beijing olympics is over the problems of china will not disappear the rich poor gap will continue to exist the people will still be deprived of their rights the human rights problem will remain and corruption among government officials will continue to exist
7501774 does such an extravagant games necessarily demonstrate our countrys strength and prosperity
7501775 fearful at heart i think the so called century old dream isnt the peoples dream and the so called best olympics is nothing more than the most costly games
7501776 olympics is being given the most important political mission the largest image project to be achieved through national mobilisation at all costs
7501777 the economic loss and sacrifice of common peoples interests are nothing compare with such a goal if a chinese has some doubt then he she will be trashed as a dissident who runs tremendous political risk if a foreigner has questions then he she will be labeled as part of anti china conspiracy group ready to be grilled i myself am ever more distanced from the olympics consciously

7501802 the oil discovery at sleipner represents a highlight in this years exploration programme on the ncs and it is encouraging that we now at the start of the big ons event in stavanger may demonstrate that new ideas prove successful in a part of the north sea that has been explored since the 1960s
7501803 this is a very exciting discovery the sleipner area is still very prospective and this well confirms that there is also a good chance of making oil discoveries in this area
7501804 the discovery is a result of focused efforts to find more hydrocarbons that may be phased in to sleipner i will credit my exploration organisation for coming up with the idea that there might be an oil column below the gas at dagny which was discovered 30 years ago
7501805 i am pleased that the result met with our expectations and that dry gas was confirmed in a reservoir with good reservoir qualities

7501926 in the process of accomplishing what is essential for our security we must
7501927 does not provide a for bringing suspected terrorists to justice
7501928 we must tell the world that the united states does not stand for torture it is
7501929 you could close guantanamo thats a good move but until the united states ends the occupation of iraq we will
7501930 prisoner abuse torture secret prisons renditions and evasion of the geneva conventions must have no place in our policy if we want muslims to open to us we should start by
7501931 one of the biggest mistakes thats been made in terms of our ability to defend our nation in a long long time
7501932 given the investment we have made in a secure facility at guantanamo far away from u s residents the administration needs to make a much more compelling case that a detainee transfer is a that it can be completed safely and that it can be done without significant impact on local communities
7501933 been and many of the reports that i see are that its not terribly different from any other prisons
7501934 if we let somebody out and it turns out that they come and fly an airliner into one of our skyscrapers were going to be asking how come we didnt stop them we had them detained
7501935 if were going to make a mistake right now lets make it on the side of
7501936 like fort leavenworth can serve the same purpose without the controversy
7501937 acquire minimal rights under the constitution in particular the right to habeas corpus
7501938 for the foreseeable future and none of the detainees at guantanamo would be brought to justice
7501939 this is an issue that flies in the face of our civic and legal traditions as outlined in the constitution
7501940 the food down there is unbelievable this is not this gulag this is a modern prison which treats people with
7501941 serious threat to the united states to our ally israel and to international security
7501942 does not believe that the use of military force towards iran should be profound mistake nyt for us to initiate a war with iran
7501943 important for the united states not just to talk to its friends but also to talk to its enemies
7501944 represents a lowest common denominator because russia and china did not agree to tougher sanctions
7501945 ultimately country to country just as we did with north korea
7501946 war with iran is not just a bad option it would be a disaster
7501947 we need to use every tool ap at our disposal including diplomatic and economic in addition to the threat and use of military force
7501948 sen clinton withdrew her candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination on june 7 2008 here for this candidates position on other top foreign policy issues
7501949 when you have mainline candidates that turn around and say that theres nothing off the table with respect to iran thats code for using nukes nuclear devices if im president of the united states there will be democratic debate gravel said iran is
7501950 there is only one thing worse than military action and that is a nuclear armed iran
7501951 will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the united states to possess the weapons to advance their
7501952 would increase the prestige of an implacable foe of the united states and reinforce his confidence that irans dedication to acquiring nuclear weapons supporting terrorists and destroying the state of israel had succeeded in winning concessions from the most powerful nation on earth
7501953 hold the current regime in iran accountable for its human rights record and to support a transition to democracy in iran
7501954 the american people have to at some point come to a real serious conclusion about the tough decision that has to be made when we may have to in fact strike
7501955 is hardly a perfect democracy its system is far superior to most of our arab allies about which we never complain
7501956 iran doesnt have a nuke and is nowhere close to getting one according to the cia
7501957 their leaders should be made to feel like those of apartheid south africa
7501958 we shouldnt let iran try to position it as an iran vs a u s thing
7501959 led efforts and called on numerous private sector and state officials to strategically divest from iran and cut off the resources iran uses to fuel terror
7501960 id like them to be a little thorn nationaljournal in the side of the government of iran
7501961 if the world doesnt act to stop irans nuclear ambitions it must be prepared for the consequences of israel defending itself
7501962 irans kidnappings are part of a plan to see that nothing interferes with its quest for nuclear weapons
7501963 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf will not act growing sanctuary
7501964 not enough of it has been in the form of and building infrastructure in the country to help develop and give opportunity to the pakistani people
7501965 progress in developing democratic institutions and meeting good governance norms
7501966 would embolden pakistans government to take a harder line on the taliban and al qaeda
7501967 for exercising their constitutional right to vote and choose their own leaders
7501968 to the exclusion of other important political actors in pakistan and its civil society
7501969 strengthen democratic institutions build civil society and improve economic and educational opportunities
7501970 a to telegraph that and to destabilize the musharraf regime which is fighting for its life against the islamic extremists who are in bed with al qaeda and taliban
7501971 actionable intelligence that osama bin laden or other high value targets were in pakistan
7501972 has opposed the bush administrations coddling of president musharraf and stood steadfastly with the people of pakistan in their struggle for democracy and against terrorism
7501973 for exercising their constitutional right to vote and choose their own leaders
7501974 to the exclusion of other important political actors in pakistan and its civil society
7501975 strengthen democratic institutions build civil society and improve economic and educational opportunities
7501976 never should have outsourced winning the afghan war of necessity against al qaeda and the taliban regime to general musharraf and the pakistani armed forces
7501977 maintain relations with the government and people of pakistan including pakistani armed forces as we support internal efforts to broker a political compromise to the internal conflict
7501978 do everything in our power to help pakistan continue the path toward democracy and full elections
7501979 first priority must be to ensure stability in this critical nuclear state
7501980 push musharraf toward open free elections toward more democratic reform to more transparency in the way both the government operates and the economy operates
7501981 the reach of the legitimate government to the tribal regions not backing down to al qaeda and the taliban
7501982 convene a meeting at the highest levels to begin a new effort towards stabilization and peace
7501983 broad based coalition government consisting of all the democratic parties
7501984 dismantle the cells and camps that the taliban and al qaeda maintain in his country
7501985 with india and pakistan to improve nuclear security and to
7501986 maintain order or restore order whichever is the case in pakistan
7501987 the attacks from that area have increased and we think that unless there is some dramatic change that we will continue to see those increases
7501988 to make sure theres not a slip back to terrorists
7501989 failure to engage al qaeda in pakistan seems to be leading inexorably to their attacking us again
7501990 allowed al qaeda to metastasize and get into the blood stream of the islamic world with its franchises of local terror groups who give their allegiance to headquarters in pakistan and get assistance in return
7501991 dealing with a neighbors house that is on fire while ignoring the house on the other side that is filled with carbon monoxide
7501992 when you have an ally that is supporting you and we are working together in cooperation with the pakistani military in that critical border area you dont announce that youre going to
7501993 not rush to abandon musharraf but work with him to get pakistan back on the path toward democracy including the release of political dissidents and the reinstatement of the supreme court
7501994 lending our own security capabilities to ensure the strongest possible protection of pakistans nuclear stockpile
7501995 says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend
7501996 were trying to strengthen musharraf were trying to strengthen the foundations of democracy and freedom in that country so that they will be able to reject the extremists
7501997 is as important to the nations long term security as is keeping u s military strength unchallengeable
7501998 more flexible inclusive and practical than it is seen to be today
7501999 that our nations environmental laws and policies balance americas need for a healthy sustainable environment with economic growth
7502000 must ensure that more middle class families reap more of the financial benefits created by this bill
7502001 and we must direct greater resources to the regions of the country that will bear the brunt of this critical transition to a clean energy economy
7502002 we have wasted the past six years on the sidelines of international negotiations and our leadership is needed to produce a global solution
7502003 i believe that action is both an environmental necessity and an economic opportunity
7502004 go a long way toward helping states and localities meet the nations clear air standards by encouraging the use of cost effective emissions reduction strategies
7502005 the most comprehensive global warming plan of any presidential candidate to date
7502006 we can reduce dependence on electricity by 25 percent by the year 2025 we can actually create incentives tax incentives and subsidies so that people use higher levels of conservation use more energy efficient technologies in their homes and in their offices
7502007 any legislation will have little impact on the global environment if we do not work together with other global polluters
7502008 moral responsibility to lead on the issue of climate change since we create so many greenhouse gases here and have a very large carbon footprint
7502009 in new mexico were the first state that followed the kyoto treaty maybe our country isnt but we did
7502010 managed to force the first real senate vote on actually doing something about the largest environmental peril our species has yet faced
7502011 would harness the power of the free market and the engine of american innovation to reduce the nations greenhouse gas emissions substantially enough and quickly enough to speech mccain called for a
7502012 that delivers the necessary environmental impact in an economically responsible manner
7502013 research and commercialization challenges ranging from carbon capture and sequestration to nuclear power to battery development
7502014 do everything we can without killing the economy to reduce co2 in the atmosphere
7502015 its a spiritual issue the earth belongs to god i have no right to destroy it
7502016 we ought to be moving rapidly towards energy sources that dont have a greenhouse gas effect
7502017 the key to sound environmental policy is respect for private property rights
7502018 to assume we have to close down everything in this country and in the world because theres a fear that were going to have this global warming and that were going to be
7502019 its a bureaucratic intrusive approach and it favors those who have political connections
7502020 encourages private citizens and requires state agencies and the states large businesses to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
7502021 americans consume more energy than anyone else so if a person moves here from another country they automatically become bigger polluters
7502022 it makes sense to take reasonable steps to reduce co2 emissions without harming our economy
7502023 research and development into technologies that improve the environment especially the reduction of co2 emissions
7502024 this has led some people not necessarily scientists to wonder if mars and jupiter non signatories to the kyoto treaty are actually inhabited by alien suv driving industrialists who run their air conditioning at 60 degrees and refuse to recycle
7502025 must aggressively take on global warming a goal that can be accomplished in a manner that doesnt provide false choices between environmental stewardship and economic progress
7502026 its time we acknowledge that a defense budget and force structure built principally around the prospect of world war iii makes little strategic sense
7502027 rogue militia roaming the country shooting without justification and without consequences
7502028 national interests are threatened when these companies act on the countrys behalf without having to answer to americans instead of winning the hearts and minds of iraqis weve made them angry and possibly fueled support for the counterinsurgency that is
7502029 increasing dominance of the military in our foreign policy may inadvertently limit our options when the military is the most readily available option it is more likely to be used whether or not it is the best choice
7502030 a political document not a substantive piece of legislation that adds anything to the concept of what our
7502031 ive joined with other democrats and republicans in proposing that we expand the army by eighty thousand troops that we move faster to expand the special forces and do a better job of training and equipping the national guard and reserves
7502032 we have a solemn obligation to provide our brave men and women in uniform with the finest equipment available particularly when they are being sent into harms way
7502033 to reflect national security priorities expanding the size of our army and marine corps and investing in critical defense infrastructure
7502034 transfer 300 million from iraqi reconstruction funds to u s army accounts for the purchase of equipment vital to the safety of our troops or to reimburse them for equipment they were forced to buy for themselves
7502035 only use offensive force after all other options including diplomacy have been exhausted
7502036 says national missile defense should not be first priority in wmd proliferation
7502037 the u s must retain sufficient forces in the region to prevent a genocide deter a regional spillover of the civil war and prevent an al qaeda safe haven we will most likely need to retain quick reaction forces in kuwait and in the persian gulf we will also need some presence in baghdad inside the green zone to protect the american embassy and other personnel
7502038 our militarized economy is both a direct cost to the american taxpayer and an indirect cost in what is lost in funding for education health care and our infrastructure
7502039 an expensive cold war jet fighter that is only a modest improvement over the f 15 yet in every conflict since 1990 we have quickly achieved air superiority al qaeda lacks hard targets and is not threatened by the f 22
7502040 extremely expensive has inherent technological flaws that will make it impossible to work as promised would have a destructive impact on nuclear nonproliferation and accompanying treaties and would have a destabilizing effect on u s relations with allies worldwide
7502041 the defense industrial complex follows a misguided strategy of buying weapons that provide americans with no increased safety buying ever more expensive fighter jets massive naval ships and a missile defense system that provides
7502042 wasting billions of dollars on cold war weapons systems designed to fight a long extinct soviet empire
7502043 a new mix of military forces including civil affairs special operations and highly mobile forces capable of fighting and prevailing in the conflicts america faces
7502044 the defense department states we neither need nor can afford
7502045 require regular budgeting for the ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan
7502046 encouraging people not to choose to become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly
7502047 sliding scale that offers generous benefits to all veterans but increases those benefits according to the veterans length of service
7502048 america can no longer rely on cold war doctrines such as mutual assured destruction in the face of threats from hostile unstable regimes
7502049 the growing demands that stretched our forces so thin during the 1990s have simply exploded yet our currently deployed force structure has not kept pace the demands for american force projection in a dangerous world compel us to look seriously at boosting the current force structure now down to ten army divisions thirteen tactical air wings and 306 ships
7502050 making up for critical gaps in our military modernization equipment personnel and health care efforts
7502051 provide force structure in massachusetts that both and allows governor romney to meet homeland defense and security requirements
7502052 not including what it takes to fund operations in iraq and afghanistan
7502053 field and fund the next generation of military systems to ensure u s forces retain dominance in the full battle space
7502054 create a much more efficient and cost effective network of plants

7502205 it would be very easy for there to be an idea that you can hold companies to ransom
7502206 the reality is he gowdiak has done a significant amount of research and clearly its understandable he wants to find a way to monetize that
7502207 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
7502208 things may come to those who wait but only the things left by those who
7502209 the last two years i have ridden over 3500 miles using easyboots epics and bares on my barefoot horses with no problems at all i think that easyboots give the horses less concussion and cuts out any chance of bruising of the soles and there is less slipping on rocks and slick surfaces much of my success in endurance rides is attributed to the easyboot products the boots have helped me put 5000 miles or more on four different horses in aerc sanctioned events i have used them in over 40 000 total aerc miles i will always use easyboots on my horses thank you easycare for your great products

7502222 theres no doubt these market conditions are weighing on retirees
7502223 today we get 401 k s while our parents are living on pensions guaranteed for life
7502224 you lay on top of that the health care crisis in this country which is of mammoth proportions and whatever savings retirees have will ultimately be emasculated by the need to pay for health coverage in their aging and potentially ailing years
7502225 historically every generation has prided itself on leaving behind a better condition than they inherited when they were born
7502226 this will not be the case for the next generation largely because of the loss of pensions
7502227 for most investors who are income oriented investors the most valuable products for them will be well diversified bond funds
7502228 that will be the best environment to preserve their principle and provide a better than average income and possibly much better than average
7502229 very rarely is the income from any safe investments by itself enough to support retirement and cover inflation
7502230 in times like now when interest rates are very low the pressure is even greater

7502238 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7502239 the obama campaign is doing their best to paper over the deep divisions in their party among the many hillary clinton supporters who do not want barack obama to be president
7502240 we want these voters to know that they still have the choice to vote for a president who is ready in this election and john mccain would welcome their support
7502241 there are a significant number of democrats that want hillary clinton
7502242 sixty six percent of clinton supporters registered democrats who want clinton as the nominee are now backing obama thats down from 75 percent in the end of june twenty seven percent of them now say theyll support mccain up from 16 percent in late june
7502243 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7502247 there are seven of us in the section ranked one through seven and we went through the entire season picking games the first one took michigan and i was fourth so i get to do the ou game
7502248 we usually spend a little more time on it in the beginning for those who have never done it before but since we do it every week you get it down and then we only spend 20 minutes to a half hour on it its a staple of the band and everyone knows it but its not easy
7502249 there is nothing like coming up the ramp and hearing thousands of fans screaming
7502250 you are so tired and your legs hurt but there is so much adrenaline pumping through you that you dont feel it every time you do it it just gets better and better

7502270 we have donated to other places but we have a member whose wife works for make a wish
7502271 we hope we get over a hundred drivers to participate
7502272 it is a standard joke round here that we like to come out on sunday and play in the dirt
7502273 we just have a love for antique tractors and we are trying to keep them out of the scrap heap
7502274 and all walks of life come together here for one thing fun
7502275 it is competitive but at the same time if someone were to break down we would help them fix it the tractor if we could
7502276 we want to win on the track not by someone breaking
7502277 i became eligible for the draft in 1964 decided to enlist then
7502278 i was fascinated with aircrafts and flying so i talked to an air force recruiter and away i went
7502279 my brother and dad gave me some advice about keeping my mouth shut and not volunteering for anything that worked out for me and it turned out to be a good experience for a farm boy from coshocton
7502280 i was there for two years but was gone quite a bit
7502281 my first assignment was what i thought it would be
7502282 i requested aircraft mechanics and ended up in a career i really enjoyed
7502283 it the c 130a could be altered for different uses
7502284 its a very reliable plane that just recently became the longest production aircraft in military history the a model was the first one built in the early 1950s
7502285 the people were very pleasant and i had an opportunity to learn the language
7502286 it didnt take me long to realize that america is a really nice place to live
7502287 we were a few miles from laos and things got pretty interesting at the base a few times
7502288 we had a few problems with infiltrators in thailand but nothing like some of my friends encountered in vietnam
7502289 our planes at that time in thailand flew a weather patrol over vietnam on a daily basis
7502290 i spent as many as three days on the flight line trying to fix the planes and keep them running
7502291 i slept on the floor or wherever i could you didnt have a normal day as far as hours go i had to be out there doing preflight and postflight repairs and maintenance
7502292 i regretted many times that i didnt stay in and make a career of it
7502293 i met a lot of great people and got to travel overall it was definitely a positive experience
7502294 at that time there was a lot of conflict and protest over the vietnam war
7502295 when i came back home i never heard one derogatory comment about the military but ive talked to other military personnel who got out during that period of time who did hear stuff i thought i was lucky to be from coshocton and never have to encounter anything like the problems there were in big cities and college towns
7502296 i got to run around the state of ohio and neighboring states it was a good career
7502297 i sold my house and got in the rv recreational vehicle
7502298 i like the south but the weather dictates where i go
7502299 i primarily do maintenance work but ive also been a costumed interpreter i just cant sit still ive got to be doing something and volunteering works out real well
7502300 we of course have an interest in secure regular reliable deliveries of russian gas
7502301 but it must be remembered that we are not only dependent on russia even if it is an important supplier
7502302 we wont see this issue in a different light this winter
7502303 we could be looking at a breach if things remain as they are
7502304 we are ready to take any decision up to halting relations altogether

7502306 i just love them all theyre all good friends and good people
7502307 when we first pulled in robbie started getting emotional before he even saw anyone
7502308 there are a lot of people here i dont know
7502309 the whole family is great and robbie is just a great person and we wanted to do what we could to help
7502310 he was an all right boss i liked working under robbie because he was a good man
7502311 hes your all american competitive race car driver and a good guy
7502312 its what this country is all about everyone coming together for just one person
7502313 it is such a bare bones production with no smoke and mirrors so we cant rely on anything but good acting and hopefully good directing
7502314 it would be good for them the students and it would be good for the theater
7502315 i believe that it is important for community theaters to reach out too we need to be entertaining and also create a link in the community
7502316 i am much more concerned with getting the best actors and they have to have good chemistry
7502317 by the end of summer it gives me a 4 foot wall of plants and i can step out of my kitchen and grab a tomato
7502318 weve actually met and talked to more of our neighbors in the last four months than we have in the eight years weve been here
7502319 a little bit of a tourist spot on the trip to the bike path at the end of our street
7502320 first people had questions now they have encouragement occasionally they even bring plants for us
7502321 we dont need to limit ourselves on what our gardens contain
7502322 should we ever need to depend on it we have a lot of greens
7502323 some of the hard to grow junipers that might not be as pretty and as productive as some of the edible plants people are pulling those out and planting blueberries and blackberries and strawberries
7502324 so theyre really great low maintenance opportunities to grow big beautiful fruits in your garden
7502325 as her alexis mary jane miller previous make up artist and shoulder to cry on i know the facts
7502326 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7502327 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7502328 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7502329 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7502330 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7502331 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7502332 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7502333 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7502334 i want to give a shout out to trey songz who came and got in the video with me shout out to gabrielle union lauren london and keri hilson i called many many more people than that but i guess you really start figuring out who your friends are when you need a favor
7502335 it was difficult because i was doing a lot of flirting and it was very very hard to focus

7502547 south african organisations will attest to facing critical skills shortages in top management senior executive and directorship positions
7502548 research from formal council registrars shows that many skilled people have exited the market and left the formal economy consequently there is a wealth of expertise out there no longer active in corporate or government entities
7502549 interim management consists of various layers of expertise ranging from independent directors to operational managers adept at managing crises turnaround programmes or projects
7502550 companies can use interim managers to bring in expert talent when they need it for as long as required
7502551 in addition their hands on involvement on projects and their ability to transfer knowledge and skills to co workers can add great worth to organisations their breadth of experience also allows organisations to ask for their opinions regarding other areas of the business
7502552 small and medium enterprises typically have a high failure rate due to a lack of technical and management skills needed to establish businesses that can compete with larger organisations
7502553 entrepreneurs often face the challenge of implementing financial technical and quality controls while addressing strategy marketing and global trade issues experienced executives can provide much needed insights and solutions for small business owners frequently overwhelmed by their myriad tasks and responsibilities
7502554 as a result it is estimated that at least a third of the value creation potential of strategies is lost due to implementation barriers
7502555 with a shortage of senior executives innovative and flexible employment solutions are crucial interim managers can be appointed to nonexecutive and independent directorship positions as well as assist with change management in relation to empowerment structuring and transformation
7502556 every business needs to satisfy stakeholders as well as legislative demands regarding employment processes and fairness placing interim managers does not interfere with these factors
7502557 this is true for both parties the reporting line and the executive associate
7502558 there is no political agenda that often accompanies the quest to form long term relationships
7502559 from a functional perspective how people enter the workplace and learn the systems processes and policies this is what experienced executives are good at they can align themselves quickly and apply their knowledge
7502560 the concept requires proper packaging with a keen appreciation for the market need and opportunity as well as the required empowerment credentials on the part of the supplier
7502561 the key lies in leveraging the individuals experience for a short to medium period
7502562 many organisations that offered attractive retrenchment packages during transformation restructuring processes resulting in the loss of astute business and technical expertise are now viewing interim management as a way of solving their skills shortage dilemma
7502563 particularly in the current economic context companies cant afford to wait to fill a senior position

7502635 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start
7502636 but that whole grind is just part of how you get discovered how you develop yourself as a performer i think it makes everything i do now more worth it because i put in all that time and all that effort
7502637 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out
7502638 there were lot of clandestine meetings in east london pubs we referred to it as plan x it was a bit of a giggle i dont think more than 10 people knew about the idea until the last few days it was totally hush hush
7502639 i went through a break up at the end of last year and i guess thats what the records about really i couldnt help thinking about it or talking about it or writing about it i wouldnt want anyone to think its the clich d break up record but i havent written about true personal experiences all that much in the past
7502640 the record of prediction markets is a strong one but i wouldnt want to use them to run an entire government

7502649 the incredible feeling of betrayal from my colleagues id worked with these people for years
7502650 it is a spiritual crisis it is a psychological breakdown
7502651 what shocked the hong kong policeman was that the triad member had phoned someone in the canadian immigration ministers office in ottawa
7502652 the officer commented with that kind of relationship youve got a really serious problem
7502653 dont worry about mcadam and what hes doing well take care of him
7502654 i was mocked demeaned and threatened in a hostile environment while dealing with some of the worlds most ruthless criminals staff in both hong kong and in ottawa gave copies of my confidential reports about some of the criminals to the gangsters themselves and that greatly put my life at risk i received death threats for a number of years but no one has ever been concerned about my safety the big question was why did canadian diplomats in hong kong and bureaucrats in ottawa do whatever they could to destroy my work and myself
7502655 as soon as one mountie would investigate theyd pull him off
7502656 another officer would come along start to make discoveries and would be pulled off
7502657 i believe both probes by the sidewinder team and by the rcmp had considerable political interference to shut them down
7502658 and it seemed to be coming from the highest levels
7502659 they found that crime members with ties to chinas military intelligence had invested billions in canada
7502660 i never dreamed this would be the outcome all kinds of material just gone
7502661 the sidewinder team leader was demoted after submitting the report he resigned and csiss almost sole china expert also resigned in disgust
7502662 at least six investigations by the u s senate and congress from 1997 to 2003 corroborated sidewinders findings
7502663 though senior management at csis maligned the report as rumour laced conspiracy theory others saw it as groundbreaking and years ahead of the curve

7502683 its true in london and in the big cities of the north it is connected to the new poverty
7502684 england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7502685 i found the cooking of people living in the slums of soweto more diverse than ours
7502686 the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish

7502694 truly truly i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
7502695 he who loves his life loses it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal
7502696 i wasnt the amazonian girl that everyone in fashion was used to with the big tits all curvy and tall i was small in comparison its funny though because i always thought i was as tall as like christy and then id be doing her makeup in the mirror and realize that i was 5 inches shorter
7502697 i was doing shows and flying economy and nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
7502698 i think about it when youre shooting you go to references in your mind you think about how you should stand in these particular clothes or how you should move you think about the different characters youre playing really
7502699 i would say im self taught but corinne day made me less conscious of myself
7502700 oh no i dont want to be different i want to have big tits i want to look like cindy crawford
7502701 weve got a beach thats erod ing thats being eaten away right now
7502702 it is affecting the way people are living what theyre used to
7502703 the north is never going to be a place that has a lot of re sources
7502704 tomorrow when i am back at the club i will discuss these things
7502705 it is important to be focused before a game last week we only talked about wigan but tomorrow i will talk about players
7502706 tomorrow when i come into the club i will discuss this or that who comes who goes
7502707 first we finished the game now we get back to london and i start a new week
7502708 if deco is scoring goals or if lampard is scoring goals is not important what is important is if chelsea win
7502709 chelsea is more important than us they are friends and if one scores the other players are happy
7502710 i read that lampard in the last two or three seasons has scored 20 goals every year this season maybe 25 but maybe 15 or 10 maybe even five it is not important if chelsea win
7502711 when you play the top teams you have to have people ready and willing to do their jobs and run a million miles
7502712 my midfield four ran themselves to a standstill you have to do that you have to physically work harder then they do but we just lacked that little bit of quality the set piece delivery just wasnt there
7502713 it was terrible and that is the one disappointment in pre season daniel de ridder jason koumas olivier kapo have all delivered and our set pieces are usually good but here they were appalling and it didnt matter who took them because they all had a go you need good dead ball specialists and we have some good ones but they were a huge disappointment
7502714 who is that lad by the way where has he been playing for the last couple of years
7502715 seriously though he oozes class and that is why he is at the very highest level
7502716 i was going to wear my sean taylor t shirt
7502717 but my wife told me that the guys here would completely ostracize me and id never get work again i almost brought it anyhow but theyd really give me crap
7502718 ever since carolina was redskins territory hell its still redskins territory just look around
7502719 i made a mistake in my my paper trimming and had to figure out a way to make the page longer
7502720 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy
7502721 did we play at our best i say no and so we have to look at why
7502722 we had problems to win our first few games last year but we won them this year we did not win that is the reality we had 60 minutes to come back on fulham and we did not do it
7502723 is that down to fulham s quality or the fact we were not good enough only the future will tell us that
7502724 i really enjoyed my first season here it was great bath is a fantastic rugby city too
7502725 there is no other club in england that i would consider i am very happy with the coaches and the team and i think bath are really capable of going somewhere great
7502726 it is obviously terrific for the club that michael has decided to stay especially signing so early in the season
7502727 he has sustained an injury to his off fore cannon bone and although it is not too serious it would be serious enough to explain his poor run on friday and is enough to keep him off the track for the rest of the season
7502728 a rt is valid for the warmth and love it carries within it even if it be the lightest entertainment or the bitterest satire or the most shattering tragedy
7502729 belgien sollte eine strecke sein die uns liegt warten wir es ab
7502730 in valencia gibt es auch viele langsamer kurven das macht uns zuversichtlich f r die zukunft
7502731 wir haben ein starkes paket und ich glaube dass wir noch einige gute rennen haben werden
7502732 das w re f r den rest der saison ph nomenal
7502733 wir haben getestet und ich habe es genossen was im moment mein hauptziel ist ich wollte das racing wieder genie en und eine maschine fahren und danach als ich dann schnell fuhr habe ich mich selbst beeindruckt
7502734 nach dem spa und dem weg zur konkurrenzf higkeit muss ich auch einen weg finden um zur ckzukommen das hei t nicht dass es der korrekte weg sein muss aber es muss mein weg sein wenn das auf meine art passiert dann werde ich vielleicht wieder zur ckkommen
7502735 das ist eine gro e herausforderung und wir sind sehr gespannt darauf das neue fahrzeug im wettbewerb zu testen
7502736 die letzten wochen waren f r das gesamte team sehr hart weil fast alles am auto neu ist die letzten teile trafen erst in der woche vor dem einsatz ein trotzdem haben wir es geschafft und ich bin sehr stolz auf unser gesamtes team das das erm glicht hat
7502737 these days there are fewer distinctions between industries and power levels pretty much everyone looks more like they belong in tech support than in a partners meeting thats because somewhere between his girl friday and casual friday between black tie and blackberrys our workforce morphed from mad men into marathon men and the race is not to the sartorial top but to the bottom of the laundry pile
7502738 in a world where profits are down bankruptcies are rampant and the most entrenched i bankers are getting the heave ho you cant afford to look as though you spared an extra second thinking about the cut of your
7502739 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7502740 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7502741 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7502742 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7502743 they were having the feast when a stranger walked in and blew himself up it is a criminal act i cannot believe that a muslim man could do it
7502744 all those who were killed are innocent people what did the children do what did the women do most of those killed are elderly people
7502745 we understand that there is another child but we were unaware at the birth of the child that there was an issue so we did not have the opportunity to act
7502746 were very concerned that the health of both of these children is monitored and that the little baby in particular can be vaccinated
7502747 weve had some phone contact with them from time to time and obviously each time were urging them to come forward
7502748 the incidences of acute reactions to the hepatitis b vaccine are extremely rare and if they do occur they are usually short lived
7502749 so if youre weighing up the risks of vaccination versus not vaccination then we would certainly recommend vaccination
7502750 we will make a decision in the best interest of the family
7502751 they were long term residents in the bay margaret and ken had been here for over 40 years
7502752 they were your grandmother your grandfather your mum and dad there was nothing pretentious about them
7502753 theres been a fair bit of support for the family whether it be meatballs or letters that sort of thing
7502754 ive been speaking with them regularly over the last few days and considering what theyve gone through theyve got incredible support from the community and family and friends
7502755 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
7502756 its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7502757 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities
7502758 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7502759 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7502760 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto
7502761 steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes
7502762 some prayer houses have been attacked and vehicles have been burnt
7502763 we pray for the restoration of peace and tranquility and brotherhood in this state

7502766 we have lost a great friend who we have loved and cherished and will continue to do so forever the bestest best man at a wedding we could hope for
7502767 why did you have to go already too many nice jumps left undone too many good times that we never had time to have play hard where ever you are and keep some beers in the fridge ill see you when i get there
7502768 its a serious problem because as of now roughly 300 000 people have come out of bajaur and many of them who were living with relatives are now shifting to camps
7502769 human life is so sacrosanct it has to be given value if we dont get money obviously things will deteriorate
7502770 we came here to save our lives but we still have problems we dont get enough food some of my children are eating scraps
7502771 enough is enough we dont want our children to die like that we want peace either through talks or military operations

7502775 at der p en m ned skal tabes yderligere 1 mia kr det v kker jo altid en vis bekymring hvorfor vidste man ikke det for en m ned siden er verden blevet s meget d rligere
7502776 det har taget en gevaldig fart i midten af april sendte roskilde bank sit kvartalsregnskab ud og ja der var lidt to m neder senere er man rigtigt p h lene og nu endnu en m ned senere der kommer s nogle mennesker og p st r at den er gal med en milliard ekstra s sp rger man sig selv hvad var det for et projektil som kom der
7502777 jeg troede dybest set at roskilde banks filialnet var s attraktivt at der var nogle der ville byde p det men det kan v re at man synes at det var for stor en mundfuld man skulle byde p
7502778 jeg vurderer at jo mere der kommer frem b de om banktrelleborg og roskilde bank s er det ikke systemet der er noget i vejen med p nuv rende tidspunkt det er isoleret til et par banker som har v ret urealistiske i deres m de at drive bank p
7502779 det er bestyrelse og direktion som ikke har gjort tingene ordentligt vi har ikke en bankkrise i norden medmindre de informationer vi f r stillet til r dighed ikke er gode nok der er ikke en af de store nordiske banker som er i det morads her s jeg tror p det er isoleret men udsteder bestemt ikke garantier for at der ikke kan sidde en og putte sig en lille smule

7502830 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7502831 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7502832 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7502833 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7502834 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7502835 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7502836 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7502837 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7502838 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7502839 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7502840 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7502841 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7502842 ive come to see iraqis feel happy its wonderful to see people smile
7502843 weve had only misery but we need to be happy this is the first time that i forget everything can you distinguish a shiite from a sunni no they are all iraqis
7502844 after the savagery and sectarian violence today i see iraqis
7502845 this is the first ive come to the capital and i see other iraqis like me
7502846 it gives me immense pleasure to play before this crowd
7502847 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7502848 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7502849 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7502850 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7502851 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7502852 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7502853 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7502854 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7502855 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7502856 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7502857 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7502858 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7502859 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7502860 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7502861 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7502862 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7502863 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7502864 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7502865 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7502866 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7502867 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7502868 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7502869 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7502870 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7502871 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7502872 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7502873 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7502874 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7502875 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7502876 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7502879 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7502880 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7502881 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7502882 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7502883 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7502884 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7502885 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7502886 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7502887 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7502895 las autoridades y representantes de instituciones de procuraci n de justicia involucradas en el acuerdo deben establecer p blicamente el compromiso de informar a la sociedad sobre los datos estad sticos de que disponen respecto de las rdenes de aprehensi n dictadas las pendientes de ejecutarse y las acciones encaminadas a lograr su pleno cumplimiento pues se estima que m s del 80 por ciento de las rdenes emitidas no se ejecutan
7502896 yo creo que la iglesia debe enfocar sus bater as a lo suyo que es la fe y las creencias de las personas y su salud espiritual y dejar que en el terreno de lo civil seamos en el estado laico los actores de las instituciones laicas quienes busquen las salidas a esos conflictos
7502897 la media media y la media baja por todas las facilidades que dan ahora las armadoras las agencias los bancos para la compra de veh culos es posible adquirir un carro que vale 140 mil pesos pagando 30 mil pesos y el resto a cuatro a os pero le incorporan obligatoriamente el seguro que tiene que pagarse por tres a os puede ser que a los cuatro a os por falta de recursos econ micos se deje de pagar ya que adem s no est muy arraigada en m xico la cultura sobre el seguro aunque ha crecido en forma muy importante
7502898 en 1999 el 25 por ciento de los carros que circulaban en m xico eran asegurados actualmente es el 45 por ciento ha crecido 20 por ciento pero debe crecer m s a esas personas de la clase media media y de la clase media baja si les roban el veh culo aunque el seguro lo paga se quedan con una cantidad muy peque a para comprar otro carro verdaderamente les afecta en cuanto a la clase alta reciben lo que les paga el seguro y autom ticamente se compran otra unidad
7502899 c mo detect la interpol el carro en finlandia viendo el n mero de serie adem s hay arcos detectores si en m xico ya se cuenta con el sistema iave para pasar por las carreteras por qu no puede colocarse ah un lector para leer el n mero del chip en las placas y saber cuando el carro tiene reporte de robo
7502900 por eso digo que el robo de veh culos es compatible con tecnolog a e informaci n la polic a no puede estar detectando y deteniendo mil 50 mil o 100 mil carros diariamente en la v a p blica eso no es posible pero deber a de haber arcos o postes con c maras que digitalmente est n tomando de la placa las series de los veh culos creo que ha faltado voluntad pol tica en el pa s tanto de la federaci n como de los estados para resolver este problema el cual de repente nos brinca cuando hay secuestros como es el caso del grave homicidio del jovencito fernando mart donde hab a involucrados dos carros robados
7502901 todas las ejecuciones los asaltos bancarios los secuestros los robos de cajas de seguridad el narcotr fico son realizados con carros robados
7502902 en michoac n el ej rcito detect y detuvo 12 hummers y camionetas pintadas con los colores y con los n meros de la secretar a de seguridad p blica federal y del ej rcito andaban en esos veh culos con gente uniformada si los uniformes los venden en las esquinas y si ahora pintan tambi n los carros hay que pensar en la gravedad del asunto
7502903 se persigue con tecnolog a e informaci n no con polic as no es posible que la polic a vigile 22 millones de veh culos
7502904 tiene que ir acompa ado de tecnolog a para que en lugar de que haya un operativo detengan el carro bajen a los ocupantes para ver su n mero el carro sea detectado por un arco s lo con pasar por las principales avenidas de una ciudad el reporte de un veh culo robado se pasar a un polic a
7502905 lo que est haciendo es encubrir a un pr fugo de la justicia que se enriqueci con dinero del sindicato y de los trabajadores mineros
7502906 lo consideraremos un traidor y un enemigo de los trabajadores del mundo
7502907 si usted dice defender a los trabajadores y sus organizaciones en estados unidos no cometa la deslealtad con trabajadores mineros fuera de ese pa s
7502908 una organizaci n de la importancia de los steelworkers escriba cartas al gobierno y al congreso mexicanos as como al congreso norteamericano en defensa de quien lastim y sigue lastimando a los trabajadores mexicanos

7502911 nuestras exigencias se resumen en una frase tener buenas leyes y hacer que se cumplan mediante la reconstrucci n de nuestras instituciones
7502912 estas exigencias pretenden edificar un efectivo sistema de seguridad p blica y justicia penal

7502917 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7502918 its always better to win through collective effort and it shows that we are not relying on any individual

7502926 since the summer holidays we have noticed an increase in people coming to the cinema
7502927 we have a lot of kids and families coming in during the day when the evening is usually busier
7502928 on some days during the week we are getting as many people through the doors as we would expect at weekends
7502929 you have to come and get me because i was just in a bad accident and cant get out of my car
7502930 admito que n o fomos bem na ltima partida mas o importante o nosso desempenho estamos indo bem conseguimos a maioria dos pontos temos de nos manter assim
7502931 realmente fiquei cansado mas n o era nada que me impedisse de entrar em campo para ajudar o vasco s que uma op o do t cnico ele quem est no comando e n o posso reclamar
7502932 estou tranq ilo com rela o a isso pois os profissionais que est o cotados s o excelentes o luxemburgo mesmo j disputou uma olimp ada e ele teve um ano de prepara o e n o ganhou medalha
7502933 tomara que n o seja nada de muito grave para que eu possa voltar contra o n utico essa partida ser muito importante para a nossa recupera o
7502934 a press o a mesma quando seu objetivo sempre ganhar estou muito feliz por ser o n mero 1 uma grande satisfa o depois de ficar tanto tempo como n mero 2 mas n o muda muita coisa
7502935 antes eu jogava bem em superf cie r pida mas n o conseguia t tulos neste ano venci toronto e a olimp ada e fui s semifinais em cincinnati
7502936 rafa agora vai sentir o que eu senti por muito tempo ser interessante ver como ele vai lidar com a press o mas at agora ele est jogado bem em todas as superf cies
7502937 foi apenas um tost o na coxa e a princ pio n o grave
7502938 eu pedi para sair pois estava com o corpo todo mole em conseq ncia de uma gripe e porque havia companheiros 100 no banco mas o treinador pediu para que eu ag entasse um pouco mais
7502939 durante a bandeira amarela eu deixei bem claro para a equipe qual era a minha op o a de n o parar mas mesmo assim eles acreditaram que dever amos
7502940 esse pit prematuro p s um fim nas minhas chances de fazer qualquer coisa positiva na prova
7502941 acho que todos estamos aprendendo lewis tamb m ele est se fortalecendo mentalmente
7502942 se n s quisermos brigar pelo t tulo n o temos outra sa da precisamos vencer fora de casa temos de secar nossos advers rios mas isso n o adianta o importante fazermos a nossa parte e somarmos pontos longe de s o paulo
7502943 esse o grande diferencial do campeonato brasileiro se voc analisar todas as rodadas at aqui vai ver que s houve uma em que mais visitantes do que mandantes venceram nas outras a vantagem foi de quem jogou em casa o gr mio tem vantagem porque venceu cinco vezes fora de casa outras equipes venceram tr s e n s conseguimos dois placares positivos
7502944 n s precisamos jogar da mesma forma em casa e fora temos conseguido resultados importantes mas precisamos de mais pontos para podermos subir na tabela e brigar pelo t tulo vamos ter de trabalhar com mais for a e conversar para buscar isso
7502945 as pessoas falam dessa quest o dos jogos fora de casa como se o palmeiras fosse o nico time que n o vence como visitante mas a verdade que todo mundo tem muito mais for a no brasileiro quando joga em casa n s precisamos buscar meios de mudar isso

7502970 its a decision that was made in san diego its not one that anybody is happy about
7502971 i think youll see more news organizations probably making this hard decision four years from now
7502972 a substantial amount of cash that really was not going to impact our primary mission of doing the best job we can in reporting local news
7502973 we have to do the stories the wire cant or wont do
7502974 i have to say i have grand plans and i want to see how much i can actually execute
7502975 four years ago we would have been editing tape to tape
7502976 given the political climate and the historic nature of this race
7502977 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7502978 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense3 and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7502979 there have been great strides made in the treatment and management of ra and it is crucial that we continue to financially support ra research
7502980 we are confident that the new grantees are among the brightest and most promising researchers in their field and will play a critical role in moving us closer to a cure
7502981 no other organization is better equipped to help meet the demand for better patient care today while advancing the course of research that will yield tomorrows medical breakthroughs
7502982 we are confident the research within our reach yields will enhance rheumatologists ability to diagnose and treat patients suffering from this painful and potentially debilitating disease
7502983 it saves us a good deal of money and it gives the inmates a sense of pride and accomplishment
7502984 were excited because we should be able to have those things for thanksgiving dinner at the jail this year
7502985 i enjoy it and brag on it weve never had any complaints some have even said its better than the donated corn
7502986 i think it gives the inmates a sense of work habit and responsibility
7502987 and in some way pride to see the produce it yields
7502988 this is a milestone in the secs work to protect and serve investors
7502989 it represents a giant step forward in our mission for the filing and disclosure of financial information from public companies and mutual funds
7502990 once the data is entered into cyberspace there are a lot of wonderful things that investors can do with the data on their own
7502991 investors will be given the same power of sophisticated financial analysis as any money manager
7502992 companies can expect further cost efficiencies when the upgrades are completed
7502993 but with interactive data i imagine you can do it faster than batting an eyelash
7502994 idea reduces manual errors because the data is collected and formatted automatically without any intermediate human steps
7502995 my anticipation is it will be just a few years before most of the world exchanges financial information using xbrl data tags
7502996 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
7502997 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
7502998 flying under the radar perverse package size effects on consumption self regulation

7503002 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
7503003 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
7503004 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
7503005 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
7503006 these figures clearly illustrate why the bma is so concerned about the governments plans to introduce polyclinics and gp led health centres and in particular the central one size fits all approach and unrealistic timescale
7503007 it appears that primary care trusts have been forced to site new surgeries where they have available buildings rather than where they are needed it would be much better value for money to invest in the existing practices so that they can further improve the quality and range of services they offer the governments approach has the potential to undermine many practices leaving them little option but to reduce their staff or services which will not be in the interests of patients
7503008 rapid identification of pathogenic agents in biological samples using pulsed laser optoacoustic spectroscopy with targeted nanoparticle contrast agents
7503009 this research is intended to develop a rugged battlefield instrument capable of detecting chemical and biological agents such as anthrax plague smallpox and others with the speed accuracy sensitivity and reliability of analytical techniques and instruments found in the state of the art laboratory today
7503010 elongated gold nanoparticles designed to strongly absorb near infrared laser pulses can be conjugated to each type of mab to create a specificity mechanism that will signal the presence of targeted pathogens
7503011 when the nanoparticles produce an acoustic response to laser pulses the presence and concentration of the pathogens is established
7503012 this is an important continuation of fairways current government and industry sponsored research when the r amp d part of this project is over fairway will manufacture the devices for the navy and other dod customers
7503013 early front line detection of biological threats using this kind of rugged battlefield system will provide critical information that can save navy sailors and lives of other us military personnel as well as support fast well informed command decision making
7503014 we are proud that this collaboration between the ut health science center san antonio the naval health research center detachment at brooks and fairway medical technologies can move this important work ahead
7503015 people automatically associate the a word with abortion but we are about so much more than that
7503016 its difficult to communicate that to people when you are defined by one small piece of what you do
7503017 there is always a core group out there where we will never be able to change minds but we hope to find some common ground with other members in the public
7503018 the true a word for planned parenthood is abortion and setting up near high schools is an easy way to get business
7503019 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
7503020 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7503021 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
7503022 using extremeness aversion to fight obesity policy implications of context dependent demand
7503023 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
7503024 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals
7503025 this paper has important practical implications for both profit and non profit social organizations interested in cultivating ways to more effectively raise funds
7503026 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7503027 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7503028 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7503029 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7503030 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7503031 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
7503032 tacit understandings of health literacy interview and survey research with health journalists
7503033 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7503034 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7503035 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7503036 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7503037 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7503038 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7503039 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7503040 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7503041 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
7503042 a new look at xxyy syndrome medical and psychological features
7503043 the magnetom trio enables us to study in great depth the brain functionality of volunteers
7503044 ongoing studies at the cbu will help to increase understanding of the brain leading to developments in the clinical side of neuroscience in the long term it will contribute to early diagnosis and create a better understanding of neuropathologies helping to improve outcomes care management and quality of life
7503045 thanks to the advances in mri technology and extensive research we have gained invaluable insight into the nature of vegetative state patients
7503046 our studies in healthy volunteers have been 100 accurate when looking for responses to yes and no questions which has enormous implications for the way conditions such as the vegetative state are assessed understanding these patients is vital for accurate diagnosis as well as for providing information to friends and relatives accurate neural maps open the door to a new type of communication meaning researchers can reach even greater depths of understanding into this condition
7503047 the pace of mri innovation is assisting not only clinical establishments but also research institutions in understanding the way the brain works mri yields detailed images of reactions and neurological functions in patients and healthy subjects this provides physicians and scientists with evidence of reactions that can go towards developing swifter diagnosis and improved care programmes

7503050 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7503051 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7503052 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7503053 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7503080 i thought it was a pretty cruddy thing to do
7503081 sure enough a bit of digging into obamas years in the illinois state senate indicates strong concern with acorns signature issues as well as meetings with acorn and the introduction by obama of acorn friendly legislation on the living wage and banking practices
7503082 what it came down to was that senator obama is the candidate who best understands and can affect change on the issues acorn cares about like stopping foreclosures enacting fair and comprehensive immigration reform and building stronger and safer communities across america
7503083 ive been fighting alongside acorn on issues you care about my entire career even before i was an elected official when i ran project vote voter registration drive in illinois acorn was smack dab in the middle of it and we appreciate your work

7503092 conventional maid implementations limit customers energy cost savings and management flexibility by spinning down and spinning up just a pre set portion of disks within each system
7503093 with the introduction of d maid datadirect networks is putting highly granular levels of energy management in the hands of customers who need scalability into the petabyte range
7503094 in terms of scalable capacity datadirect networks can package 1 2 petabytes into two floor tiles accomplishing with two racks what takes competitors up to six or more
7503095 the addition of its intelligent power management solution d maid to its s2a data infrastructure platforms makes for a very compelling value proposition for end users
7503096 in a recent analysis of customer it environments we found s2a systems helped customers save up to 66 percent of their energy use depending on their configuration and utility rates for example an s2a9700 or s2a9900 user in a metropolitan area with 1 2 pb of capacity and an 80 percent data dormancy rate is forecast to go from using 21 7 kw to 10 3 kw saving nearly 40 000 per year these are tangible savings that customers can benefit from today
7503097 because spinning disk drives typically account for 80 percent of a storage arrays power consumption a technology such as d maid can be highly effective at greening storage which can account for as much as 30 percent of energy consumed in the data center wikibon is pleased to be working with datadirect networks to facilitate customer applications for incentive rebates offered by utilities such as pacific gas amp electric company for utilizing technologies that conserve energy

7503168 berbiete das die spiele von peking endeten so spektakul r wie sie begonnen haben
7503169 die bergabe hat mehr an die zeiten des swinging london als an die kosmopolitische finanzmetropole die sie heute ist erinnert wenn das ein statement der organisatoren war sich nicht mit der gr te und dem spektakel von peking zu messen sondern stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen so ist das empfehlenswert
7503170 wir sollten etwas skurril britisches bieten mit einem langanhaltenden erbe und ohne schrecklichen kater als die spiele von peking zu einem spektakul ren ende kamen gab londons b rgermeister boris johnson einen grellen vorgeschmack auf den individuellen stil der in vier jahren erwartet werden kann die schrullige show stand im kontrast zu der perfekt abgestimmten extravaganz der chinesen in gigantischen dimensionen au ergew hnlichen farb effekten einem bombardement von feuerwerk und atemberaubender artistik
7503171 london kann es nur mit einer kollektiven anstrengung schaffen und einem enthusiasmus den viele wom glich f r unzeitgem oder v llig unbritisch halten
7503172 als die nationalhymne gesungen war kam londons chance die welt zu beeindrucken wo peking auf unermessliche zahlen von darstellern setzte nutzte london seinen weltruf und die popul rkultur
7503173 au er den technischen dingen kann london nur sehr wenig von peking lernen nie wieder wird eine nation das geld und den politischen willen aufbringen um olympische spiele diesen ausma es hervorzubringen
7503174 wir m ssen es auf unsere weise tun der traum von london 2012 ist jetzt realit t geworden und in den n chsten vier jahren wird sich die bohrende aufmerksamkeit der welt nach gro britannien richten wenn wir irgendetwas von peking gelernt haben dann ist es nicht noch einmal zu versuchen was hier in china gemacht wurde f r diese spiele waren die kosten unz hlbar
7503175 wenn es irgendwelche zweifel gab dass die spiele 2012 in london anders sein werden als die in peking sind sie mit dem auftritt von londons b rgermeister boris johnson verschwunden ein frecher schuljunge unter erwachsenen
7503176 die ordnung und der pomp der er ffnungsfeier wurde ersetzt durch leichtigkeit frivolit t und spa die schlussfeier erinnerte an eine gigantische party
7503177 vom entz nden des olympischen feuers im vogelnest am 8 august bis zur schlussfeier diese spiele geh rten zu den erinnerungsw rdigsten und spektakul rsten berhaupt aber das berragende thema dieser spiele war kontrolle nach all den aufrufen zu frieden und harmonie nach all den hoffnungen die mit der vergabe der spiele an peking in sachen offenheit und menschenrechte verbunden waren hat es china nicht geschafft die erwartungen zu erf llen
7503178 die spiele waren ein zweifelhafter triumph f r china die welt bewunderte die organisation und die finanziellen mittel von den sportst tten bis zu den verschwenderischen zeremonien auf der anderen seite war es bei allem zu viel der organisation
7503179 fast perfekte organisation rekordflut legend re leistungen die ersten olympischen spiele in china waren ein gro er jahrgang der dem asiatischen riesen erlaubt hat seine kraft unter beweis zu stellen der aber auch die grenzen seiner toleranz aufgezeigt hat
7503180 china auf der ganzen linie siegreich die organisation war perfekt die opposition wurde erstickt und der sportliche erfolg hat sich eingestellt
7503181 china die neue supermacht der gastgeber hat die usa in der welthierarchie entthront auch wenn nicht alle legenden dieser spiele aus china kommen
7503182 china ein koloss mit 100 medaillen die schlussfeier hebt die sportlichen erfolge des landes hervor sie ist zwar informeller als die er ffnungszeremonie sie ist aber trotzdem magisch gigantisch und perfekt
7503183 die olympischen spiele sind zu ende und china ist ein bisschen n her ger ckt
7503184 das china der spiele siegt ber die menschenrechte die welt hat keine klare politische orientierung gezeigt welche china bei den menschenrechten zu einem politikwechsel zwingen k nnte man hat den chinesischen drachen nicht einmal durch fernbleiben bei der er ffnungsfeier in verlegenheit bringen wollen
7503185 rogge behauptet die internationale gemeinschaft habe etwas von china gelernt und china von der internationalen gemeinschaft angesichts der wiederholten schweren verst e gegen grundrechte wie pressefreiheit und meinungsfreiheit durch die chinesische regierung im rahmen der olympischen spiele ist die rede rogges eine schande f r den ioc
7503186 die gigantische sensations show die sommerspiele 2008 bertrafen alles was organisation ablauf und pr zision betrifft
7503187 bye bye peking eine farbenfrohe und stimmungsvolle abschlussfeier china hat zum abschluss der olympischen spiele noch einmal sein leistungsverm gen demonstriert
7503188 peking schlie t die spiele mit einem sehr britischem akzent ab jetzt sind die engl nder dran die besten spiele der geschichte zu organisieren
7503189 wer im kader ist hat auch die m glichkeit zu spielen
7503190 es ist besser aber ich wei noch nicht ob ich spielen kann
7503191 wir freuen uns sehr im rahmen der er ffnung unserer neuen heimat den eishockeyfans in ganz deutschland und nat rlichen unseren eisb renfans ein highlight wie dieses pr sentieren zu k nnen
7503192 es wird ein tolles match und man wei nie vielleicht gewinnen wir sogar

7503197 ashlynn was great to work with of course but many of the ladies in the title are either new or shoot on the gonzo side of the industry i havent had a chance to work with them much but they gave me exactly what i wanted scenes that were sexy and fun with lots of tease and sensuality leading up to the sex
7503198 i wanted to shoot something that was more than what ive seen in the genre
7503199 i love scenes where the sex naturally progresses from the interaction of two people thats what im bringing to pov movies
7503200 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
7503201 so i fell in love with the mandal headboard but i dont have a bed in my room or a wall big enough to put it on so i sawed the headboard down the middle mounted the two halves vertically i ended up with a pretty cool looking shelf i also had an extra piece of wood that fit in the slots so i added a mini shelf at the bottom
7503202 monopolies have been allowed to form stifling competition consumer choice and indigenous growth of the software industry in aotearoa new zealand
7503203 it must work for people not the profits of the few people on both sides of the digital divide should benefit from information technology it should not create new mechanisms of inequality and of course our policy assists people to utilise it to reduce their impact on the planet
7503204 microsoft wants to restrict the greatest profits in the knowledge economy to already established software corporations like itself

7503211 a light trailer newly built by a man living a 100 yards away from the police station was whirled past
7503212 people wandered aimlessly about collecting what remained of their belongings their minds hazy as to what the future held for them their wits shattered by the catastrophe which had descended suddenly upon them
7503213 the unveiling was a celebration for her and a chance for us to say our last goodbye
7503214 since her death we have been bringing up our three grandkids we got custody after she died
7503215 the kids have not heard or seen their mother for a year at the unveiling was the first time they had seen her
7503216 we are not angry there is no point whatever attitude we have wont bring our baby back
7503217 we are relaxing now that our darlings headstone is up all we do now is focus on our babies that are here
7503218 it is how drp always fabricate to hide what their leader had done to us
7503219 he must have now learned that the people of thinadhoo do not like him but the campaign fabricated of a larger support for him from the visit
7503220 i drummed for alicias voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves
7503221 after a couple of years of wanting to collaborate with alicia keys it took james bond himself to finally make it happen
7503222 alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch it gave me a new voice and i wasnt myself anymore
7503223 la relaci n con cheppi se torna dificultosa desde que fue disciplinado por el gobierno

7503225 la pol tica de este gobierno es la de estafar al consumidor y castigar al productor

7503229 she in common with the great majority of international transit passengers is not obliged to pass through new zealand customs processing points provided she elects to remain in the transit areas of the international airport
7503230 transit passengers often have no contact at all with our officers
7503231 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present
7503232 we share intelligence with agencies all around the world but we do not get every drug smuggler or every shipment of contraband that comes our way
7503233 that is a sad fact of life for customs agencies everywhere

7503237 at least our folks will have it first thing when they wake up
7503238 some republicans and others suggested that obamas 3 a m et email had been intended as a deliberate swipe at hillary clinton who ran a primary season ad that referenced that hour of the morning to make the case she was more qualified to handle a breaking crisis

7503287 the air was kind of hazy when we started out but by ten p
7503288 i worked on the song and the song worked on me for a good couple of weeks i was working one day with mike taylor an acoustic guitarist who had performed with me at the cellar door and had moved out to aspen mike sat down and showed me this guitar lick and suddenly the whole thing came together it was just what the piece needed when i realized what i had another anthem maybe a true expression of ones self maybe we changed the sequencing of the album wed just completed and then we changed the album title

7503300 we call on the german government to read the mood it is not the herero community alone they have been joined by the nama people and how that tsunami could be stopped i dont know
7503301 we demand these skulls back in order to bury them in dignity
7503302 that scientific research must surely be concluded by now and the results made known
7503303 these skulls did not belong to germany when they were sent to germany a century ago whom did they ask for permission then if germany cannot return them without that request from the namibian government we take it as an open challenge and invitation for our government to do so
7503304 we shall continue to demand reparations from germany even if it should take us another 100 years or more
7503305 the german government and parliament should not take this issue lightly because if the hereros and namas are pushed to their limits like in 1904 this could deal a serious blow to the otherwise good relations existing between the two countries
7503306 similarly our demand for dialogue with all stakeholders on the 1904 atrocities is not asking for the impossible or something unreasonable
7503307 the healing process between the affected namibians and the german government will not be complete without them the skulls resting in eternal peace
7503308 we intend to sensitise the berlin government about our seriousness for a meaningful dialogue with a clear purpose of ensuring a process of restorative justice healing and lasting reconciliation
7503309 no lasting reconciliation is possible without meaningful dialogue and we will continue to sensitise both governments of this unfinished business

7503338 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7503339 non ti uccido adesso perch turberei bella ma se la riporti di nuovo a casa ferita e non mi importa di chi la colpa fa lo stesso se inciampa o se un meteorite cade dal cielo e la colpisce in pieno se me la riporti in uno stato di salute che non quello in cui era quando te lho lasciata ti spezzo le gambe lo capisci randagio che non sei altro e se ti azzardi unaltra volta a baciarla ti spezzo la mascella al posto suo

7503430 conventional maid implementations limit customers energy cost savings and management flexibility by spinning down and spinning up just a pre set portion of disks within each system
7503431 with the introduction of d maid datadirect networks is putting highly granular levels of energy management in the hands of customers who need scalability into the petabyte range
7503432 in terms of scalable capacity datadirect networks can package 1 2 petabytes into two floor tiles accomplishing with two racks what takes competitors up to six or more
7503433 the addition of its intelligent power management solution d maid to its s2a data infrastructure platforms makes for a very compelling value proposition for end users
7503434 in a recent analysis of customer it environments we found s2a systems helped customers save up to 66 percent of their energy use depending on their configuration and utility rates for example an s2a9700 or s2a9900 user in a metropolitan area with 1 2 pb of capacity and an 80 percent data dormancy rate is forecast to go from using 21 7 kw to 10 3 kw saving nearly 40 000 per year these are tangible savings that customers can benefit from today
7503435 because spinning disk drives typically account for 80 percent of a storage arrays power consumption a technology such as d maid can be highly effective at greening storage which can account for as much as 30 percent of energy consumed in the data center wikibon is pleased to be working with datadirect networks to facilitate customer applications for incentive rebates offered by utilities such as pacific gas amp electric company for utilizing technologies that conserve energy

7503688 need to consider the economic environmental political and social goals they care about defending as chinese influence grows
7503689 to violate human life is always and everywhere wrong in fact we dont think its a matter of church teaching but a matter of the way god made the world and it applies to everyone
7503690 on the surface level it does sound suspect and does raise red flags
7503691 i happen to be one of the people who believes that theres a great deal of christian imagery and symbolism in the books and i think it answers at least in parts a longing that we have for christ

7503694 the history of st johns is that weve been moving gradually from the model of the separate oasis to the midst of the city and of the campus and part of it is simply because of the expansion of brighton around us
7503695 we are preparing men for ministry in the 21st century in an extraordinarily diverse diocese of 144 communities 2 million catholics and many urban centers and if our seminarians dont face these challenges and issues as seminarians they will the day theyre ordained im not afraid that having a very diverse and wide experience at seminary is somehow going to corrupt our seminarians
7503696 this is designed to assure the financial stability and viability of the seminary and of i do not consider myself competent to speak about the financial stability and viability myself competent to speak about those of st johns seminary m d that is my intention today i do not intend to speak against the cardinal but i do intend to speak against the proposal that is being submitted there are three points to be considered in voting for this proposal the proposal is mistaken in judging that the seminary is not fiscally stable and viable and it is mistaken in judging that the seminary needs financial assistance it is mistaken in its expectation that the terms of the proposal will assist seminary on the contrary and this is the third point the terms of the proposal will in my judgment bring about the demise of the seminary in the first place the proposal assumes that the seminary is not fiscally stable and viable t would point out however that for two years now since the the seminary has received no appropriation from rcab yet is alive and well during the 8 march 2005 trustee meeting one member of the budget and finance committee observed the strongest financials in the history of the seminary
7503697 neighboring boston college has purchased large tracts of former archdiocesan land near st johns in order to insure the integrity of the seminary the visitors recommended that no more property should be sold
7503698 the doctrine on the priesthood presented this is evident in all course syllabi the pastoral and spiritual programs too reflect a sound doctrine of the priesthood faculty and staff readily accept this teaching
7503699 the prayerful atmosphere of st johns seminary is one of its most outstanding and noticeable qualities there is a strong emphasis on fostering asa authentic priestly spirituality in all areas of formation
7503700 the seminary therefore needs to be supported so that its mission continue to flourish

7503733 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
7503734 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
7503735 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
7503736 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
7503737 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

7503787 it doesnt really bother me where i play id prefer to play centre back but we had a lot of clean sheets last season when i played left back
7503788 if we can keep more clean sheets with the goal threat we have its a recipe for success
7503789 if the manager asks me to go to left back with the team 1 0 up at ipswich im just going to do the job
7503790 the manager has options with myself daniel jones stephen ward and michael gray who can all play there
7503791 he can use the transfer window so there are plenty of options and if i have to play there he knows i will
7503792 if anyones asked to play a different position theyll do it because we all want to play well for wolves and hopefully take this club places
7503793 its so disappointing because georges attitude and application have been excellent
7503794 no one like to see anyone get injured so we all wish him a speedy recovery
7503795 weve got players who can fill in such as neill collins who he did very well on saturday darren ward came back which no one thought would happen after he was put on the transfer list
7503796 but hes trained very hard and did very well on saturday and weve also got daniel jones it wouldnt surprise me if the manager enters the transfer market or looks at loan options
7503797 so nothing new but we expect markets to take the statement on the dollar as positive news considering todays holiday in the u k markets may be illiquid and thin

7503809 nars and lorac both have these silver grays and dark grays that have just a bit of shimmer you can use matte but a touch of shimmer works great even in day cover the bottom half of your eyelid from the inner corner to the middle with lighter gray then use the darker gray to finish out all the way to the outer lashes fan it out by stroking the color up a bit
7503810 take a soft black color like the shades from laura mercier and layer on starting at the outer edge of your eye moving up to the crease this is where your blending skills come in
7503811 finish with a fantastic eyeliner i dont like liquids here i like smudgable liners in the movie annas wearing cargo katmandu the cream liner in this compact sweeps on and is good for smudging i finish by fanning out a little at the outer corner of the eye
7503812 underneath lower lashes i dont line with pencils a better trick is to take shadow and with a thin skinny brush smoke up the lashes underneath especially at the edge really blend all truly smoky eyes need a bottom and top layer

7503867 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7503868 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7503869 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7503870 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7503871 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7503872 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7503875 in the future we hope to explore relevant behavioral cues for other robot tasks in human robot work environments and work on the robotics and computer science tools needed to make effective use of those cues

7503957 das problem ist dass diese bakterien nicht nur im krankenhaus auftreten sondern oftmals bereits von au en eingeschleppt werden
7503958 der kampf gegen hochresistente erreger ist mit den bisherigen mitteln wie dem einsatz immer neuer antibiotika und intensiver desinfektionsma nahmen nicht zu gewinnen wir m ssen neue wege gehen um das gefahrenpotenzial f r unsere patienten zu reduzieren
7503959 es ist aber sicher nicht notwendig und sinnvoll jede abteilung im krankenhaus mit kupferbeschl gen auszustatten

7503968 der grund daf r d rfte sein dass eine amputation f r die betroffenen der anfang vom ende ist und sie sich innerlich aufgeben
7503969 durch die amputationen sind die patienten nicht mehr in der lage alleine f r sich zu sorgen und landen in der vielzahl in pflegeheimen
7503970 da kann doch kaum noch von einer erleichterung f r die patienten gesprochen werden
7503971 das problem bei diabetikern ist dass sie oftmals gar nicht mitbekommen dass sie eine wunde haben
7503972 dann reicht schon ein nicht bemerktes taschentuch im schuh aus dass sich eine blase unter dem fu bildet und diese kann sich bei nichtbehandlung entz nden

7504078 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7504079 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7504080 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7504081 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7504082 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country

7504224 luciano moggi in una sua recente uscita ha dichiarato che il calcio non per i gay
7504225 magari qualcuno ci sar pure per io credo di non averlo mai incontrato
7504226 per sai visto che largomento principale nello spogliatoio quellaltro l insomma se c deve dissimulare proprio bene
7504227 okay ma se qualcuno tirasse fuori il problema cambierebbe anche latteggiamento di tutti gli altri no
7504228 scherzi in questo mondo dove la tifoseria gi ti attacca mogli e fidanzate figurati se uno si dichiara gay lo massacrano striscioni cori un inferno
7504229 comunque negli sport usa ci sono molti che hanno fatto coming out e sono stati accettati tranquillamente
7504230 verissimo per magari mi sbaglio ma la mia sensazione di non aver mai incontrato un calciatore gay
7504231 perch premier e liga hanno pi fascino della serie a
7504232 be dai il contorno la tifoseria gli stadi il modo di vivere il calcio l sono unaltra cosa
7504233 litalia paga lo scotto di una tassazione troppo sfavorevole i club di premier e liga pagano molte meno tasse e hanno un potere contrattuale troppo forte
7504234 la vera differenza con la premier che l non c un giornale che dia un voto vero gambero
7504235 io difficilmente guadagno lattenzione della stampa ed giusto cos le prime donne sono gli attaccanti gli adrian mutu gli jovetic il nostro nuovo fenomeno
7504236 be guarda che essere primedonne va considerato nel bene ma anche nel male
7504237 ma dai nellultima amichevole c stato uno di noi che stato una vergogna prima pagina questo giocatore da sballo gamberini per 90 minuti si fa il mazzo un difensore e non lo vede nessuno

7504239 senza un po di incoscienza pure nel mondo dellimprenditoria certi traguardi non li raggiungi ma qui si trattava di salvare la squadra di una delle citt pi belle e famose del mondo poi c chi ci ha letto una scelta legata alla nostra azienda ma in realt i nostri prodotti di lusso hanno poco a che fare con il mass market del calcio
7504240 sfatiamo il mito non si guadagna un bel niente litalia ben diversa da inghilterra e spagna

7504242 non mi do pace per questa cultura contrattuale ma come i contratti valgono dappertutto fuorch nel calcio non mentalit italiana europea si pensi al caso cristiano ronaldo a noi era gi successo con luca toni per gli sono bastati 5 minuti per capire e rinunciare ai tanti soldi che gli aveva promesso linter e io gli dico guadagna pi che puoi al bayern e poi torna da noi fra un paio danni

7504244 this is the latest british wheat harvest in 10 years
7504245 we need good weather this week to assure milling wheat quality particularly hagbury falling number scores
7504246 imported milling wheat could offset temporary shortfalls in domestic supplies he said a spokesman acknowledged that wet weather had significantly delayed the countrys milling wheat harvest but denied that key quality characteristics had been damaged so far
7504247 its too early to tell whether the wet weather will reduce quality
7504248 it could be getting to the point where we do get worried
7504249 vi cuando los jueces les robaron descaradamente las peleas a dos boxeadores cubanos en las semifinales los nuestros combatieron con dignidad y valent a atacaban constantemente ten an esperanzas de ganar a pesar de los jueces pero fue in til estaban condenados de antemano

7504251 el rbitro le suspendi el combate cuando estaba ganando tres a dos no fue el nico caso es muy grande el poder del rbitro en ese tipo de competencias y ninguno el de los atletas

7504274 i have known sen biden over the years and it is a good choice it will help to unify the party
7504275 in talking over the last 24 hours to a number of very intense clinton supporters my sense of their view is that if it wasnt going to be hillary this is the next best choice
7504276 the real thing that needs to be paid attention to in iraq is a political solution there has not been any progress on that
7504277 it was more or less a blue collar family his family lost their money and his father struggled it was not easy
7504278 monday night has the potential to be much worse with thunderstorms very heavy rain and possible tornadoes
7504279 this track will put north georgia in the very wet right quadrant of this system
7504280 any thunderstorms will produce torrential rainfally and potentially several inches of rain
7504281 it has therefore become imperative that i explain for the benefit of members of the public who may have difficulties appreciating the legal position the relevant constitutional provisions on who takes over when the president dies the process leading to the assumption of office of the new president and related issues
7504282 under article 38 2 of the republican constitution if the office of president becomes vacant by reason of his death the vice president or if the vice president is absent or is unable due to physical or mental infirmity to discharge the functions of his office a member of the cabinet elected by the cabinet shall perform the functions of office of president until a person elected as president assumes office
7504283 ninety days refers to ninety calendar days in this case the ninety 90 days began to run on the 19th august 2008 when president mwanawasa died the period of ninety days includes saturdays and sundays as well as public holidays it also includes the days of national mourning
7504284 after due consultation between the ministry of finance and the electoral commission of zambia the date for the presidential election will be announced in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and electoral act
7504285 neither the constitution nor the official oaths act provides for the oath of office for an acting president
7504286 the vice president banda already subscribed to an oath of office as vice president on assumption of that office he becomes acting president by virtue of his being substantive vice president accordingly there is no legal requirement for the vice president to take an oath as acting president
7504287 general elections will then be necessary this is because article 88 7 states that whenever the national assembly is dissolved under this article there shall be presidential elections and elections to the national assembly and the first session of the new parliament shall commence within three months from the date of the dissolution
7504288 for the avoidance of doubt elections to be held following dissolution of the national assembly will include elections to the office of president even if the person to be elected will have served for only three years
7504289 we have no choice as a people of zambia we have to hold these elections constitutionally we are bound to hold these elections and of course cooperating partners sometimes have supported us in holding these elections so we believe in good governance we believe in constitutionalism therefore we are going to hold these elections within 90 days
7504290 prices of steel and oil have seen a steep rise over last eight months leading to increased cost of manufacturing because of this we need to source more and more components and other accessaries from india to uk and other centres
7504291 the overall slowdown in construction business has not affected us so far but the same might show certain impact in another three months in addition to this the inceased interest rates on loans too have affected our business but we will still grow at a similar rate as last year
7504292 our business has been relatively working capital intensive and lack of it was hampering our operations and curtailing our growth we believe this infusion of equity from peepul capital will not only enable us to overcome this immediate hurdle but also allow us to make long term investments to further improve our overall efficiency
7504293 statoil wants to increase stake to 30 per cent and get joint operatorship in kg 98 2 we are however willing to give only up to 22 per cent stake
7504294 governmental approval for this share was given in july this year and there is no new information given after this approval we look forward to cooperate in this partnership
7504295 that will address their issue of higher stake and our issue of keeping the highest stake
7504296 we want to avoid a situation where we are left with the same stake as the others and have also given away our sole operatorship
7504297 we read one christian book after another explaining how to know him but we seldom read a book explaining hot to walk by faith in the fact that he also knows us
7504298 he is the vine we are the branches john 15 5
7504299 and i saw thrones and they sat on them and judgment was committed to them and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god who had not worshipped the beast nor his image and had not received the mark on their foreheads or on their hands and they lived and reigned with christ for a 1 000 years
7504300 but the rest of the dead did not live again until the 1 000 years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection over such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
7504301 but you shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the servants of our god
7504302 you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which you shall speak to the children of israel

7504448 did you know that jesus died on the cross for your sins
7504449 it is absolutely senseless that one person is dead and another is clinging to life because of the actions of this individual
7504450 he could have taken the car and never harmed the victim but he intentionally chose to take her life it is now our job to make sure that he answers for this needless act that showed a complete disregard for life
7504451 we hope that someone can identify the person who committed this horrific crime and will call police with information on his whereabouts
7504452 we have learned a lot from our early corporate customers
7504453 the new quikit service is designed to help our corporate customers cut costs by significantly reducing the administrative overhead associated with billing and catering management using quikit administrators and catering managers can simplify their existing processes by implementing a system based on their specific needs and requirements for example a companys catering administrator can setup some basic rules such as the typical number of people served in a meal the percentage of the meal that should be vegetarian food allergies and dietary preferences and the budget per person for meals
7504454 last year i was tasked with heading up a dinner service for multiple engineering groups at amd

7504462 mommy was crying mommy broke the table mommys in rug
7504463 i heard loud noises in the middle of the night every night
7504464 shes not exactly your ideal neighbor she and i havent gotten along since day one
7504465 were talking carloads at a time four and five carloads and until 3 or 4 in the morning
7504466 we were able to determine that there was a domestic situation
7504467 then suddenly there were police knocking on my door around 4 a m asking questions
7504468 but it wasnt a break in and it wasnt random violence
7504469 for the 10 years i worked here as manager nothing like this has ever happened
7504470 flores pulled out of the lot with the lights off ditched the suv but then walked back
7504471 he was looking at the damage he did to the car
7504472 this is one of the safest apartment complexes ive ever lived in
7504473 but what happened was horrible it seems unreal that it could happen here
7504474 for every resident over 18 and our employees we perform a background check
7504475 so theres not even any way a past resident could use an old key on the doors
7504476 i think she only had the apartment for about six months
7504477 i had to tell the staff what happened this morning
7504478 they let us bury her thinking that a healthy 22 year old girl died by some freak accident
7504479 we probably should have said there are some suspicious circumstances here and that probably would have ended the problem
7504480 certainly one could armchair quarterback it but to say there was a cover up or some sort of insidious plan there is crazy
7504481 we wanted her to stay close she didnt want to go too far away
7504482 eastern had a very good nutrition program and was close enough for her to drive home on the weekends
7504483 the number of rapes committed by muslim immigrants in western nations are so extremely high that it is difficult to view them only as random acts of individuals
7504484 two men from sweden one from finland and one from somalia
7504485 im really passionate about stopping rape i think its terrible
7504486 it is not as wrong raping a swedish girl as raping an arab girl
7504487 the swedish girl gets a lot of help afterwards and she had probably fucked before anyway but the arab girl will get problems with her family for her being raped is a source of shame it is important that she retains her virginity until she marries
7504488 it is far too easy to get a swedish whore girl i mean
7504489 many immigrant boys have swedish girlfriends when they are teenagers but when they get married they get a proper woman from their own culture who has never been with a boy thats what i am going to do i dont have too much respect for swedish girls i guess you can say they get fucked to pieces

7504493 we were told to take off all of our clothes
7504494 they asked if we had any money we said take our money take whatever you want we didnt have any money
7504495 told aaron that he had until 11 54 to get hard and they counted down from 11 52 to 11 53 to 11 54
7504496 i asked him if he was going to hurt us and he said no
7504497 i said do you promise youre not going to kill us
7504498 on the way back he said he wished we couldve met under different circumstances he said i was cute and we probably wouldve hit it off
7504499 i turned to heather and said theyre going to shoot us
7504500 then i heard aaron sander i could distinguish aarons voice he said please no sir please the gun went off
7504501 i felt the bullet hit the back of my head it went kind of gray with white like stars i wasnt knocked unconscious i didnt fall forward then someone kicked me and i had fallen forward i was playing dead i didnt move i didnt want them to shoot me again
7504502 then i turned my head and saw lights going i looked at everyone everyone was face down jason befort was next to me i rolled him over there was blood squirting everywhere so i took my sweater off and tied it around his head to try and stop it he had blood coming out of his eyes
7504503 weve all been shot three of my friends are dead
7504504 whos going to take care of the kids in school
7504505 i was just hoping if i did what they said theyd let me live
7504506 it reasonably appears that these were isolated incidents where individuals were chosen at random a random act of violence
7504507 the fact that the defendants and victims happen to be of different races has no bearing lets just look at the underlying crimes
7504508 wed have to let the aryan nations come in here if they decided they had an interest
7504509 were racially motivated crimes that the da and city of wichita have no interest in pursuing
7504510 i wouldnt call it outrage but id call it suspicion this gag order upsets me
7504511 appalled a mistake like this could lead to such severe consequences for so many people
7504512 it is unfortunate this happened but we have to learn to get past that and let those things go and get on with our life
7504513 we cant deal with how things should have been or could have been we can only deal with today
7504514 forgive them father for they know not what they do
7504515 a victory of love over hate a victory of mercy over justice
7504516 heather would want us to pray for her murderers and heather was probably praying for them at the moment of her death

7504595 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
7504596 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
7504597 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
7504598 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
7504599 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan

7504837 before jim was activated during the entire summer of 2004 he had a lot of dental work at the va in tucson arizona he had no symptoms and no one observed lesions in his mouth he was healthy and fit all his life this came up suddenly and just devastated his body quickly
7504838 jim did mention the terrible pollutants coming from the smoke stacks and the brown water he washed his clothes in while in theatre i read about depleted uranium and talked with him about it but he never said anything about being exposed to it and i dont think they tested him for it we asked the doctors if agent orange could be the cause and they said there was no way to tell we asked if he had been exposed to something in kuwait and again they couldnt say they did comment frequently on how aggressive his cancer was
7504839 when the doctor told him he had six months to live i dont think he believed it he still asked for more treatment
7504840 he tried to get stronger and the doctor said well you could try more chemo and die from a heart attack or you could die from the cancer
7504841 over 4th of july weekend skin lesions multiplied canvassing his neck back and chest
7504842 there were hundreds thousands of lesions circling the upper part of his entire body

7504844 it was the first time i had seen him laying still resting so i went back to the fisher house
7504845 the next morning i returned to the hospital at the usual time 5 00 am only to see his room door closed
7504846 i knew when i saw the door closed something had happened and the nurses asked if i had gotten a phone call and i did not they said he passed away at 4 55 am five minutes before i arrived
7504847 so i guess he was comfortable he slipped away in peace remaining in the same position i left him in the night before
7504848 jim said he knew where he was going and hed be okay but please pray for dixie

7504916 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive it s a direct effect
7504917 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while but it hadn
7504918 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite seaside destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7504919 i think we have a natural affinity with our coast and the sea but we all need to be aware that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable
7504920 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7504921 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense3 and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7504922 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately
7504923 and overall far more people will be given it which increases the risk of pregnancies especially if this is not properly screened for and then theres more abortions
7504924 if were in nato we wont have to worry about nato attacking romania over our relations with our hungarian minority the way you attacked yugoslavia
7504925 since turkey has been in nato for decades you let them do what they want with the kurdish minority
7504926 if thats why you want to get into nato ill make sure you never do
7504927 whats that guy so upset about he looks the way i felt when i chaired my last judiciary committee meeting
7504928 hes got some big problem on his mind do you know what it is
7504929 i dont think i have spent that much on clothing since we have been married why would i spend that on suits
7504930 i dont even wear a suit to work you want me to buy them so they will sit in my closet
7504931 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
7504932 do you really want to deprive the us of people who look like us
7504933 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7504934 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7504935 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7504936 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7504937 when mohammed was arrested i was 22 years old my children were babies
7504938 today i feel like ive been reborn my familys life has begun today

7504940 wilt u alstublieft uw eerlijke mening geven over de oplossing voor het tekort aan voedsel in de rest van de wereld
7504941 moet je nu toch zien jullie hebben me naast een zwarte neergezet dat kan toch niet jullie kunnen toch niet van mij verlangen dat ik de hele vlucht naast een kaffer zit regel een andere zitplaats
7504942 de vlucht is erg vol en het ziet er niet naar uit dat we ergens anders nog een plek over hebben meer weet u wat ik kijk even in de business class om te kijken of daar nog plek is
7504943 ik heb goed nieuws we hebben op het laatste moment nog een afmelding gekregen en in de business class is nog een luxe stoel vrij het is voor ons hoogst ongebruikelijk om iemand tijdens de vlucht een plaats aan te bieden in de business class maar ik heb toestemming gevraagd aan de piloot hij was het met mij eens dat het geen stijl is dat iemand noodgedwongen urenlang naast zo n strontvervelend persoon moet zitten
7504944 u kunt hier blijven zitten ik had het tegen de meneer die naast u zit
7504945 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
7504946 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
7504947 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
7504948 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
7504949 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
7504950 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
7504951 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
7504952 the pam ayres of wedding rhymes brings back merriment to the big day
7504953 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7504954 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7504955 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7504956 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7504957 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7504958 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7504959 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7504960 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
7504961 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7504962 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7504963 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7504964 they were having the feast when a stranger walked in and blew himself up it is a criminal act i cannot believe that a muslim man could do it

7504968 we definitely felt internally we were going to be no 1 but saturday was a pleasant surprise
7504969 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role
7504970 they courted him for almost a year for this movie he considered it but passed

7504976 la informaci n que tenemos es que la ni a se acerc a los agentes de la polic a iraqu diciendo que llevaba puesto un chaleco explosivo y que no quer a explotar con l
7504977 si fue obligada a ponerse el chaleco o si lo hizo voluntariamente es lo que estamos investigando
7504978 el hecho de que la ni a se haya entregado quiere decir que los iraqu es siguen rechazando a al qaeda y sus pr cticas

7504983 la informaci n que tenemos hasta ahora es que las rebajas han ido muy bien con un incremento de entre un 15 y 20 m s de ventas pero el volumen de facturaci n del conjunto de la temporada ser menor un 5 menos seg n nuestras previsiones a causa de la ca da del consumo
7504984 que se ha vendido m s en rebajas pero con tanto descuento que no sirve para compensar el conjunto de la temporada
7504985 a partir del 15 de agosto se han visto rebajas de hasta el 70 del precio algo que no pasaba hace a os
7504986 es un intento de salvar los muebles pero ser muy dif cil ahora lo que interesar a es que empezara a hacer fr o porque aparte del problema de la crisis la climatolog a ha sido muy variable esta temporada el calor vino tarde y no ha incentivado la compra de prendas de vestir
7504987 el sector de moda con un 20 menos de negocio muebles un 40 menos y electrodom sticos con m s del 15
7504988 la electr nica y la inform tica de consumo tambi n han registrado un 15 menos de ventas en el conjunto de la temporada precisamente en un sector en donde los precios est n bajando
7504989 la electr nica como el sector de la moda y confecci n es deflacionista porque cada a o se ofrece m s calidad sin aumentar los precios
7504990 el freno del consumo es psicol gico en un 50 las familias han dejado de consumir por el efecto psicol gico por o r y o r hablar de crisis no porque los precios hayan subido o porque hayan perdido poder adquisitivo
7504991 la banca ha restringido el cr dito al consumo y la capacidad de endeudamiento de las tarjetas de cr dito
7504992 ya que se ha sufrido el efecto de la subida del eur bor y de la gasolina pero hay gastos que las familias siguen haciendo como las vacaciones o el ocio en detrimento de las compras
7504993 las administraciones p blicas han de impulsar pol ticas de confianza y reducci n de impuestos para que el consumo pueda reactivarse
7504994 este a o todav a vamos a aguantar pero si la cosa sigue as en el 2009 tendremos que hacer ajustes de personal
7504995 wir gehen herunter von unglaublich starken raten im vergangenen jahr zu starkem wachstum in diesem jahr und normalem im kommenden also acht bis neun prozent

7505011 i think northern california always loses were smaller and more rural that southern california and if you line up our representatives in sacramento against the representatives from down south we lose most every time
7505012 but it now looks like it will get the money isnt that good news isnt that supposed to be a reason to celebrate not to becky she is as unhappy as ever here is a quote that made me the truth want to scream

7505021 would be no more than a jumble of rail and concrete without careful zoning and transportation planning by the cities and counties served by the project
7505022 the merger with grey wolf is a perfect strategic fit for both companies
7505023 together we can deliver high value services that will provide significant value to our customers employees and securityholders
7505024 grey wolf shareholders will be able to receive immediate value for a portion of their shares through the cash component of the merger consideration and will have the opportunity to participate in the upside as securityholders in a combined company whose scale financial strength and strategic advantages position it well for future growth

7505028 allah willing i will get the chance to kill more israelis
7505029 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7505030 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7505031 there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7505032 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians it matters a lot to the palestinian people and it is obviously a sign of good will
7505033 on both sides the israelis and the palestinians have work to do
7505034 the region will want to be concerned about a buildup of arms in syria at a time when in fact the syrians and the israelis are trying to talk peace
7505035 there was no way i could do it without god i didnt expect it to be so smooth i never got any mechanical complications throughout the race
7505036 im very happy for the win it means a lot to me and justifies the hard work i have put into racing
7505037 ive got nothing to hide so electronic surveillance doesnt bother me to the contrary im delighted that the bush administration is monitoring calls and electronic traffic on a massive scale because catching terrorists is far more important that worrying about the governments listening to my phone calls or reading my emails
7505038 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

7505058 i think we miss the boat an awful lot because we let really talented young ones go by the wayside
7505059 a lot of nations approach the talented youngsters a lot younger than we do
7505060 the governing bodies tend to say theyre too young to be funded now because they might never make it
7505061 we dont go in there and identify them young and put them in the national squad at the age of 13 or 14
7505062 we as a sport wait until 17 18 and then start putting them into squads and on funding
7505063 and its not just for 2012 were also looking at glasgow in 2014 we want a really strong scottish team and if thats the case you have to be looking at your 18 year olds
7505064 the best at their disciplines and their sports have to be funded and trained in the right manner so that in the next 4 6 years theyre peaking the older ones are not going to peak at that time
7505065 the governing bodies have to get it right now because if weve got the whole nation behind us supporting 2012 and the whole of scotland behind us supporting 2014 and we dont get any medals then youre going to let the whole nation down
7505066 everyone gets really excited when they start seeing people getting the medals you saw that this year
7505067 people would be talking about sports that they had never even watched before because somebody got a gold medal in it it just catapults your sport to a whole new level and theres more attention put to that sport
7505068 i think a lot of people could learn how to put the games on from the chinese they did a great job
7505069 it was very much suited to the athletes that were there and the medal haul of team gb seems pretty successful
7505070 were going in the right direction with the sports that weve got in great britain obviously some sports didnt fulfil their medal haul but most of the sports did really well and it just shows especially looking towards 2012 that were on the right pathway for being successful
7505071 some of the scottish participants in the different disciplines did exceptionally well i think we can have a really positive attitude now that weve got some good scottish role medals coming back with medals which are going to really inspire the kids of scotland
7505072 i see it already from the people that i coach that are at a good standard whereas before they would be saying id love to be on the olympic team and id love to be part of it all theyre now saying i could probably get a medal too if i work hard

7505090 toate initiativele sunt la nivel declarativ cand e sa treaca la actiune nu o fac
7505091 romania este un stat mediu din ue ca marime este un stat nou are o influenta redusa nu este integrata in spatiul schengen si in zona euro au fost probleme inainte de aderare are inca probleme cu coruptia inca nu si a facut toate temele fata de ue
7505092 arata expertul european reamintind ca summit ul ue din 1 septembrie convocat de presedintele francez pentru a discuta situatia din georgia este un bun prilej vizita presedintelui basescu in moldova a dat mesajul potrivit
7505093 este necesara restructurarea fortelor pacificatoare ca sa raspunda la intrebarile si la necesitatea asigurarii acelor acorduri care sunt intre statele respective unde activeaza aceste forte mai ales in conditiile de conflict
7505094 a mai spus popescu adaugand ca armenia incearca acum sa se pozitioneze ca un posibil stat de tranzit
7505095 razboiul creeaza o noua dinamica si deocamdata nu stim directia in care merge ea nici din punct de vedere politic nici in ceea ce priveste nabucco
7505096 presedintia franceza a ue pare destul de decisa si trebuie suprapuse discutiile despre georgia pe tendintele mai largi franta a promovat la inceputul presedintiei ei o politica de securitate si aparare mai integrata iar georgia este un test pentru ea
7505097 este pe de o parte dorinta de a avea o uniune europeana mai puternica in relatiile internationale si pe de alta parte reticenta fata de est neimplicarea ue in georgia ii va submina drastic sansele de a juca rolul international pe care si l doreste
7505098 exact ideea asta ca germania nu vrea sa supere rusia jucand un rol mai pregnant in europa de est si in caucazul de sud a creat conditiile pentru georgia si pentru rusia care au dus la escaladarea situatiei
7505099 i was 20 when i played opposite roger moores james bond i was just a brand new actress i was definitely not trying to be in any kind of sexy movie because i was actually cast to be a virgin lets face it so how sexy can a virgin be not very
7505100 so anyway that was what i played and that i suppose is what i specialised in if you think about it for a while professional virgin because of course on dr quinn medicine woman i was a virgin until i was in my 40s although dr quinn was always 10 years younger than i really was
7505101 i did very little to emotionally prepare to play shelly darlington because i guess shes always been in there somewhere but i did work out i got some hair extensions a lot of padded bras and i guess thats the extent of my prep
7505102 i dont think its a stand against not being a model
7505103 guillermos sets are always incredible on both hellboys i was blown away when i walked on set the costumes are so detailed and impressive as well
7505104 it is so great to be an actor on his movies because the surroundings really help you believe you are in this fantastic world youre basically living inside the brain of this brilliant director
7505105 i know how to shoot a gun because my sister was a police officer so she taught me how to use one safely but it is so different when youre using them in a movie you have to pretend to be shooting one so you have to mimic the kickback after you fire it i was so bad at it
7505106 we will have to deal with the aftermath of a rather large number of bank failures over the next year which is likely to overwhelm the ability of the fdic to insure your bank deposits

7505110 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
7505111 despite the widespread enthusiasm about the 2008 presidential elections connecticut residents are not optimistic about what it portends for an economic recovery
7505112 i think there are some major innovations that need to occur before we see that happen
7505113 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
7505114 larger babies do better it could have an important implication for babys health
7505115 were becoming more ethnically mixed but our growth is next to nothing
7505116 their postpartum physical health or emotional health interfered at least some with their ability to care for their baby
7505117 we knew we were going to win one day that optimism never left us
7505118 if someone has made it to the age of 75 and they dont have an elevated psa the likelihood of them developing clinically significant prostate cancer in the last 10 to 15 years of their life is pretty low
7505119 more than in any election i can remember the vice presidential choices made by these candidates stand to make a significant difference especially among undecided voters

7505356 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7505357 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7505358 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7505359 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7505360 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7505361 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7505362 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7505363 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7505364 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7505365 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7505366 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7505367 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7505368 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7505369 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7505370 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7505371 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7505372 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7505373 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7505374 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7505375 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7505376 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7505377 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7505378 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7505379 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know
7505380 on a night like this i definitely get those pre performance butterflies i think thered be something wrong if i didnt get them just a little bit its mr trump
7505381 tonights sort of more intimate setting just with a very stripped down band of mine so it should be fun
7505382 i think a lot of people wish that they could cut their hair and had the guts to do it everyone says its so courageous im like not really its my job
7505383 shell probably just end up giving the stuff away thats not something she will just get over
7505384 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7505385 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7505386 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7505387 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7505388 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7505389 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7505390 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7505391 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7505392 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7505393 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7505394 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7505395 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7505396 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7505397 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7505398 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7505399 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7505400 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7505401 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7505402 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7505403 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7505404 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7505405 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7505406 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7505407 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7505408 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7505409 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7505410 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7505411 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7505412 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7505413 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7505414 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7505415 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7505416 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7505417 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7505418 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7505419 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7505420 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7505421 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7505422 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7505423 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7505424 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7505425 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7505426 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7505427 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7505428 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7505429 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7505430 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7505431 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7505432 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7505433 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7505434 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7505435 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7505436 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7505437 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7505438 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7505439 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7505440 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7505441 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7505442 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7505443 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7505444 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7505445 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7505446 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7505447 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7505448 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7505449 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7505450 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7505451 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7505452 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7505453 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7505454 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7505455 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7505456 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7505457 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7505458 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7505459 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7505460 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7505461 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7505462 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7505463 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7505464 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7505465 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7505466 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7505467 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7505468 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7505469 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7505470 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7505471 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7505472 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7505473 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7505474 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7505475 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7505476 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7505477 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7505478 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7505479 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7505480 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7505481 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7505482 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7505483 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7505484 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7505485 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7505486 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7505487 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7505488 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7505489 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7505490 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7505491 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7505492 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7505493 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7505494 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7505495 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7505496 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7505497 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7505498 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7505499 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7505500 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7505501 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7505502 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7505503 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7505504 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7505505 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7505506 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7505507 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7505508 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7505509 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7505510 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7505511 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7505512 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7505513 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7505514 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7505515 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7505516 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7505517 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7505518 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7505519 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7505520 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7505521 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7505522 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7505523 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7505524 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7505525 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7505526 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7505527 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7505528 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7505529 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7505530 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7505531 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7505532 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7505533 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7505534 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7505535 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7505536 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7505537 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7505538 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7505539 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7505540 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7505541 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7505542 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7505543 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7505544 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7505545 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7505546 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7505547 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7505548 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7505549 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7505550 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7505551 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7505552 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7505553 a ver si me lee mi amiguito a del alma
7505554 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7505555 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7505556 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7505557 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7505558 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7505559 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7505560 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7505561 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7505562 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7505563 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7505564 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7505565 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7505566 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7505567 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7505568 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7505569 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7505570 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7505571 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7505572 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7505573 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7505574 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7505575 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7505576 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7505577 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7505578 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference

7505581 oh loogit me im an injury prone running back with fancy shoes and fitted hats that still have the label on them
7505582 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7505583 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7505584 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7505585 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7505586 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7505587 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

7505591 indiecater vol 2 is quite different from traditional compilations as i am a music blogger and not a record label the album is a release from a fan with no hidden agendas as every song that appears on the album is hand picked for no reason other than the fact than i love it
7505592 the compilation was put together through the goodwill of the acts involved although they will be getting a royalty for their contribution there are no middlemen no packaging costs and no fingers in the pie so it can be sold quite cheaply the ultimate aim is to focus attention on some great music that would otherwise have slipped through the inter net
7505593 the most satisfying thing about the release of the first album was the general thumbs up with which the music was received
7505594 much of the albums success can be attributed to the fact that many of the tracks such as those featured on the new album are exclusive

7505761 this is what we were hoping for and more than what we were expecting
7505762 youre seeing these kids excited its an opportunity for them to be in the spotlight that a lot of kids dont get that opportunity to be on espn and abc and play in such a prestigious tournament
7505763 all i can say is congratulations good job and aloha
7505764 they gave 100 percent every game it definitely exemplifies what hawaii is all about
7505765 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7505766 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7505767 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7505768 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7505769 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7505770 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7505771 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7505772 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7505773 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7505774 the thing i think with our guys that we have i think they can make plays for us hank has shown that greg lewis has shown it jason avants shown it obviously in the game against new england making a nice catch on a td pass youve got to give guys opportunities to make plays call plays for them get em comfortable in the offense get the guys around them comfortable with them there and i think things can work out well
7505775 obviously from a team perspective anytime you lose your guy with 77 catches and over a thousand yards 1 110 thats tough for any offense to replace
7505776 one person just cant replace it at this particular time its really just continuing to involve everybody and spread it around the important factor for us is to make sure we get reggie back and healthy you know you cant lose both of your top receivers we have to at least get reggie back and then when the time comes well get kevin back ready to go
7505777 its just an honor to be able to play receiver and catch balls from him
7505778 they were playing cover 2 and i had to get in the hole and make a great play happen
7505779 it was a great ball by donovan put it in the hole then rodney harrison was right there to make a hit
7505780 i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7505781 you dont want that to linger on and then all of a sudden you tear something else it was good that he got the surgery now and he can start rehabbing now to get himself back out on the field
7505782 he already has control of the offense he knows the playbook inside and out so now he can just go out and do what he does and thats put the throws like hes putting them being able to step into that medium not thinking about it youre seeing what donovan does
7505783 lehmans business is broader than fannie and freddie but the link is that they were doing the same thing packaging mortgages and selling them
7505784 investors are unwilling to accept any positive view of the company management is unwilling to sell out at a deeply distressed value
7505785 the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
7505786 we do see lehman continuing to reduce commercial real estate exposures with an eye toward bringing total illiquid assets down another 20 billion by year end
7505787 brians one of those kind of guys whos so valuable to your team because he can impact it in so many places
7505788 he can play running back or fullback he can start a game for you he can come in on third down and catch a pass for you
7505789 its not easy managing your roster in this league if youve got a true blocking fullback or an undersized tailback theres not a lot else you can do with them but brian can do everything is he going to be great at any of them i dont know but i know hes going to be very very solid for us at everything
7505790 i think his value to this team is just going to keep increasing as he gets more experience and we know exactly what we want to do with him
7505791 when they drafted me they kind of told me they were going to be using me for everything including special teams
7505792 one of the reasons they took me was because they liked my versatility i think im most effective when im in a different role at different times
7505793 i had thought about coming out for the draft after my junior year
7505794 then i came back expecting to get a lot of carries and the ball in my hands and that obviously wasnt the case coach sat me down and talked to me about it he told me that was going to be my role and i accepted it
7505795 it was the best thing for the team i still got the ball in my hands a lot i carried it seven eight times a game and caught it five six times a game it wasnt as much as 30 40 times a game like it was in the past but i was ok with it looking back i think it helped me out in the long run
7505796 for us to be able to see that he could do that play fullback really increased his value with us when we were evaluating him he was going to be billed as a heisman trophy candidate going into his senior year and they basically told him they needed him to take one for the team that really impressed me hes a very unselfish guy
7505797 blocking was tough ac joint sprains here and there then you build up calcium in the joints and they start scraping together but they took all that out and now im as good as new
7505798 he came in and took every practice rep never told us about the pain he was in or the problems he was having
7505799 hes one of the best running backs in the league but its given the rest of us a chance to get a lot of reps which cant do anything but help in the long run
7505800 probably one of the toughest offenses to learn in the league but i love it once you get the grasp of it its great its all about getting the ball in the playmakers hands and weve got a lot of playmakers on this team
7505801 having gone through that before i know it can change
7505802 i would say i was frustrated more than anything because i wanted to finish out that last little bit of action with the ones out there and get off the field it was frustrating in that respect
7505803 i dont worry about injuries at all actually theyre going to happen regardless ive had ankle injuries in the past and its the same thing you go out on the field you play ball if you get injured you get treatment and get back on the field thats pretty much the way i am
7505804 i didnt feel anything friday that would tell me anything different than what i was thinking that it was just a sprain
7505805 it feels good to go out there and just to be out there on the field period
7505806 so many times i havent made it to this point healthy its really fun to be out there doing what you love
7505807 that chinese dude who ran around the top of the stadium
7505808 i fear this will make americans think chinese are bad
7505809 its their decision to put me wherever they want to
7505810 obviously when you are the last guy on the team you just want to make people happy
7505811 i think its just a matter of time until he hits hes a good hitter and hes going to hit
7505812 we need to get home and get on with that now
7505813 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy
7505814 but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7505815 coming here 4 years ago he instilled a sense of belief in our team that we could come back at that time i think we were eighth in the world we didnt win a lot of tournaments it took a couple of years until we started to win some big events
7505816 this match is a culmination of a vision and dream that hugh gave to our team 4 years ago
7505817 it seems so very far away but he talked about it with great conviction his ability to say we need to believe it before it will happen and then that we will need to do the work he impressed that upon us
7505818 being a fan of philadelphia soccer is almost going to be like a full time job
7505819 soccer is not a spectator sport its a participation sport
7505820 you dont wait for a basehit or a first down to get into it instead of waiting to yell charge after a horn blows you are engaged for a full 90 minutes of people trying to pick up the team themselves and the people around them
7505821 its real important for us to make as many efforts as we can to reach out to our fan base
7505822 we already have 5 000 seat depositors who have no idea what its going to cost no idea where their seats are going to be no idea whos on the team
7505823 for them to give us that kind of commitment weve got to step out and do things in response
7505824 its critical that we put on a production everyone deems fair and balanced though thats not a phrase nbc normally uses
7505825 the issues dont go away sometimes you have to re ask the questions in a different framework
7505826 the past two debates weve done have been pretty freewheeling
7505827 my cheapest and most accurate focus group my three sisters my wife and my kids
7505828 deep concern for the daily lives of the american people
7505829 the options are me or john mccain and that will bring a lot of conservatives together
7505830 theres a ceiling as to how many votes sen mccain will get
7505831 the best line i ever read from you was about me this was after the glory days in 1993 when we were all beat up dutch daulton inky pete incaviglia head dave hollins me we had no chance you knew it anyone who had a clue about baseball knew it the column was in the middle of spring training you wrote and the phillies will have lenny dykstra masquerading in centerfield one more year for some reason that made me laugh so hard because you were so right
7505832 at least once a year based on where people have moved
7505833 just joined up for kicks a couple months back when this first came up so i should be like no 40 900 or thereabouts
7505834 we think the people will really see value in being on that list even if they wont see a ticket in their lifetime as you and others have pointed out but theyll see value in being on the list i think
7505835 weve kind of been a one sized shoe fits all with our communication moving forward we want to be very specialized in our communication based on what the fans want from us
7505836 we felt it should be a free thing to be on the list knowing how long it does take to move off the list it just didnt seem fair to charge for it
7505837 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7505838 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7505839 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7505840 just because ive got chipper on the other side and hes leading the league that isnt going to turn my switch on to try to play the game hard
7505841 i play the game hard no matter what no matter whos in town
7505842 the best line i ever read from you was about me this was after the glory days in 1993 when we were all beat up dutch daulton inky pete incaviglia head dave hollins me we had no chance you knew it anyone who had a clue about baseball knew it the column was in the middle of spring training you wrote and the phillies will have lenny dykstra masquerading in centerfield one more year for some reason that made me laugh so hard because you were so right
7505843 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7505844 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7505845 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7505846 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7505847 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7505848 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7505849 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7505850 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7505851 we should be very proud of the effort we showed

7505853 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7505854 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world

7505907 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available

7505960 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7505961 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7505962 if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7505963 is this evidence of some male conspiracy keeping women down
7505964 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7505965 thats what youre up against its that sort of assumption

7505977 das innovationspraktikum war viel interessanter als herk mmliche ferialjobs bei denen man alleine einfach irgendwas machen muss
7505978 sunspots sind kleine elektronische programmierbare ger te mit denen man rasch prototypen bauen kann

7505984 sen barack obamas bid for party unity at the democratic national convention which opens monday is being challenged by angry supporters of sen hillary rodham clinton who refuse to let heal wounds from a brutal primary fight that their candidate lost
7505985 as democrats arrived here sunday for a convention intended to promote party unity mistrust and resentments continued to boil among top associates of presumptive nominee barack obama and his defeated rival hillary rodham clinton
7505986 sixty six percent of clinton supporters registered democrats who want clinton as the nominee are now backing obama thats down from 75 percent in the end of june twenty seven percent of them now say theyll support mccain up from 16 percent in late june
7505987 just imagine if you had massive amounts of republicans defecting from the gop and declaring theyd be voting for barack obama youd have a nonstop deluge of obamacan stories flooding the media
7505988 our study focused on inter domain traffic and an obviously incomplete though we believe representative large subset of isps
7505989 we do not have any details on the traffic through the ams ix switch but given the near complete lack of global ipv6 content and corresponding dns records bgp routes etc the ams ix traffic may represent more localized rather than broader internet traffic

7506032 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7506033 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7506034 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7506035 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7506036 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7506037 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7506038 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7506039 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7506040 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7506041 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7506042 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7506043 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7506044 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7506045 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7506046 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7506047 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7506048 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7506049 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7506050 our belief is that the apsa should choose its sites carefully with particular regard for questions of freedom of speech and conscience
7506051 have written in areas that seem particularly disfavoured by the canadian legal establishment
7506052 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7506053 the nature of radical islamism and the relationship of public morality and homosexual conduct are issues of vital public importance
7506054 all political scientists have a professional interest in a full and open scholarly debate
7506055 turn a blind eye to canadian attacks on freedom of speech
7506056 protection of academic freedom equitable access to opportunity and a commitment to non discrimination
7506057 our belief is that most americans even apsa members have no idea how precarious the rights of freedom of speech and conscience are in canada
7506058 whereas members of the association ought to be able at the 2009 annual meeting to present research and argument on controversial topics such as public policy concerning homosexuality or the character of and proper response to terrorist elements acting in the name of islam without fear of legal repercussions of any kind we petition the council and staff of the apsa to take all steps necessary to ensure that academic freedom and free speech even on controversial topics such as these are not threatened at the 2009 annual meeting including soliciting legal advice and seeking the assurance of the government of canada and local authorities that the civil rights and liberties of members to free speech and academic freedom will be secure

7506072 discrete actions or practices that people can choose to do
7506073 a vast array of individuals seriously over rate the importance of money in making themselves and others happy
7506074 study after study from psychology shows that money doesnt equal happiness
7506075 people are wedded to the idea that more money will bring them more happiness
7506076 when they think of the effects of more money they are failing to factor in the fact that when they get more money they are going to want even more money when they get more money they are going to want a bigger house they never have enough money but what they do is sacrifice their family life and health to get more money

7506095 nur wenige der befragten unternehmen geben an ber ein zentralisiertes oder zentral geleitetes vertragsmanagement zu verf gen
7506096 hinzu kommt dass viele keine standardprozesse im vertragsmanagement implementiert haben sie arbeiten mit hauseigenen systemen aus tabellen und datenbanken die weder die n tige skalierbarkeit aufweisen noch die entsprechenden zugriffsm glichkeiten erlauben und keinerlei transparenz bieten dies sind aber faktoren die f r eine abteilungs und funktions bergreifende zusammenarbeit unerl sslich sind
7506097 interessanterweise stimmen die herausforderungen mit den funktionalit ten berein die sich die befragten von einer contract management l sung erhoffen das zeigt das gro e potenzial f r unternehmen prozesse durch die automatisierung ihres vertragsmanagements effizienter zu gestalten
7506098 eine umfassende l sung zum vertragsmanagement kann einen systematischen prozess f r die erstellung durchf hrung archivierung compliance und analyse von vertr gen in einem unternehmen erm glichen dies hilft bei der optimierung der betrieblichen performance der kostenreduzierung und der minimierung von risiken

7506130 osteoarthritis is marked by various degrees of inflammation and according to the american heart association current therapies such as common nsaid based pain relievers can increase the risk of heart failure stroke hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding in some patients the technology could fit well with our collaborative multi disciplinary approach to orthopaedic and rehabilitative conditions and we believe it holds promise not only for patients with osteoarthritis but also in post surgical and post injury situations as well
7506131 the company has developed a version of its tpemf tm technology for prescription pain relief as a non pharmacologic alternative to pain relievers such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs for inflammatory conditions we are in discussions with partners for this market although fda clearance would be needed to market our product for this indication

7506199 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
7506200 we have observed these abuses the festival will be used to correct these abuses observed in the way our female members dress some songs that our choirs sing and in the celebration mass some bishops have frowned at these things and have decided that we should find a way of addressing the issues
7506201 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest

7506220 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7506221 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7506222 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7506223 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7506225 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7506226 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7506227 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7506228 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7506229 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7506230 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7506231 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7506232 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7506233 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7506234 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7506235 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7506236 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7506237 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7506238 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7506239 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7506240 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7506241 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7506242 who are open to doing something on the production side
7506243 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7506244 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7506245 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7506246 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7506247 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7506248 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7506249 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7506250 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7506251 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7506252 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7506253 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7506254 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7506255 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7506256 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7506257 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7506258 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7506259 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7506260 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7506261 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7506262 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7506263 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7506264 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7506265 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7506266 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7506267 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7506268 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7506269 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7506270 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7506271 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7506272 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7506273 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7506274 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7506275 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7506276 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7506277 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7506278 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7506279 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7506280 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7506281 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7506282 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7506283 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7506284 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7506285 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7506286 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7506287 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 percent to 44 percent advantage last month
7506288 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7506289 all efforts of the afghan government to avoid civilian casualties have not yielded any positive results and our innocent countrymen are still killed in anti terrorism operations
7506290 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7506291 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7506292 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7506293 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7506294 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7506295 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7506296 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7506297 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7506298 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7506299 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7506300 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7506301 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7506302 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7506303 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7506304 not really were still in the championship nothing has changed it would have been nice to finish the job today but it wasnt to be thats sport
7506305 no not concerned we would love to have won the game the reality is that the game is a draw i cant change the circumstances of what happened 20 minutes ago
7506306 the reality is we played quite well and conceded two goals late in the game and were here talking about a replay next week
7506307 its very disappointing for darragh darragh is a very passionate player always was the way he played he has given fantastic service as an amateur player to this game unfortunately hes got targeted blamed and painted with different brushes all his career
7506308 players in all games are going to be targeted players are pencilled out because of their talent players are pencilled out because of their inspiration
7506309 it disrupted us more than it disrupted them we totally lost our shape thats not the first time that ive seen that happen in terms of my own personal experiences of playing with 15 against 14 the best of plans can go asunder on it
7506310 we didnt play well on the day we were seven points down and brought it back to six i looked at the clock there were two minutes left and i said to one of the selectors we need two goals here jeez were pushing the boat out on that one
7506311 but i make the comparison to something yesterday i was listening to the premiership on the radio
7506312 but in a tight race we cant afford to lose a small number hopefully obama will bring in enough new and first time voters to offset that

7506326 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7506327 it was not a nice weekend but it is not the first time
7506328 we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7506329 my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7506330 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for all the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7506331 it is more important and more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7506332 i truthfully wish we were playing someone else in the final
7506333 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7506334 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one too

7506337 i can remember having chicken nuggets and chips for the first and thinking i can eat this without being sick
7506338 before that i couldn t eat anything without having a panic attack and my throat tightening up i couldn t even stand the smell of other food
7506339 i used to get ill quite a lot while classmates would have a cold for a week i d have one for four
7506340 people thought i was being fussy they didn t understand that i physically couldn t eat anything else
7506341 we don t normally like to keep them inside but they can be quite noisy
7506342 people should be grateful to hear them it s like a beautiful symphony
7506343 we expect that the points that have been agreed to but not yet met will be fulfilled in the next few days
7506344 it must now some to an end one way or the other
7506345 well show the infidels well land on a crescent moon
7506346 a proper team must have a winning mentality and we have that we overcame all adversity and always believed in our chances the second half was beautiful and exciting the final score was fair to the effort made by my players
7506347 this rarely happens i had never lived such an experience before neither as a player nor as a coach it was very surprising i relied on the opinion that some teams sometimes find it harder to play with one man more than their opponent the team unites more and works even harder when its one man down concentration also improves our opponent tonight didnt know how to play with their advantage and we benefitted from it
7506348 robinhos situation naturally isnt comfortable it was my decision not to use him tonight he is still on the team because we are waiting to see what happens and we hope he will finally stay with us this year
7506349 i had enough with thinking about what i was goiung to do than to think about what my opponent may have done we had to change the match but i guess losing like that must hurt valencia have a young and talented coach and i think they proved they will be an important team this year
7506350 this team has a very solid base that was hard to get we will keep an eye open in case some new signing can be made but it will be hard to improve on the quality of this squad
7506351 robinho is the same player he has always been he is important and should be a part of this project i think he knows he can make it big here we must resolve the situation as best as possible but we are all selfish and the best solution would really be for him to stay with us for many years
7506352 european teams have to improve each year we have complete faith in our team but other sides will work hard to be at the top of their game we hope to reach as far as possible
7506353 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7506354 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7506355 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7506356 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7506357 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7506358 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7506359 canadas athletes rose to the occasion providing exciting and memorable moments which included personal bests and new national records
7506360 canadians watched your outstanding performances with great pride and excitement and we salute you
7506361 today i like all canadian sports fans am looking back with pride at the many memorable performances of our fellow canadians at the 2008 olympic games
7506362 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7506363 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7506364 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7506365 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7506366 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7506367 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7506368 the colours of these nimbus beauties ranged from featherly light whites to raging scarlet reds and gave the audience that
7506369 brilliant stuff by the way we have another assignment for you game
7506370 a quarter million people moshing all at once anything could happen
7506371 the whole thing is going to explode into violence there will be death and dismemberment we have to go see this
7506372 a very promising new act with some well written material
7506373 the biggest amp best show in l a for the money
7506374 ya never know whos gonna show up and jam on stage
7506375 the biggest amp best show in l a for the money
7506376 i used to throw the discus at school but had never picked up a frisbee all my friends think it is a hoot
7506377 doing it with the love of my life wonderful to have pa my father in law and my mother in law with us its a real honour
7506378 aishwarya really looked after me and pampered me it is very cute
7506379 the 700 billion that goes overseas for oil each year we get no royalties we would get about 140 billion in royalties if that oil were being produced on federal land we also would pick up about 210 billion in taxes from the people and the companies employed to do it in the united states so that puts you at around 350 billion of domestic benefit just from taxes and direct royalties and that doesnt include the fact that those people with their high paying jobs employ other people buy boats buy cars and do the other things that feed america
7506380 anwr is just the name for an area that is contiguous to prudhoe bay where we have been producing millions and millions of barrels a day for decades we could take several thousand acres that would be used for drilling in anwr and we could give ten times as many acres to the preserve just contiguous to it just a little bit over ive been up there personally ive seen the tundra that stretches on for hundreds of miles it is a beautiful pristine wilderness but theres no shortage of beautiful pristine wilderness up there when you have tens of thousands of square miles of identical wilderness
7506381 we must invest in renewable energy resources which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore which will take 10 years and produce two cents reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump
7506382 in washington we dont call people liars what we say is that theyre being disingenuous the speaker is being disingenuous
7506383 here are the facts it took an act of congress in 1973 to clear out the environmentalist litigation hurdles for alaskan oil and initiate development of the north slope oil once the environmentalist hurdles were cleared it was a mere 35 months before oil was pouring from the pipeline at valdez developing anwr oil will be the same terrain but logistically far easier than developing the north slope
7506384 our local governments look at it from a couple of different angles number one the increased cost at the pump for all of our school systems our law enforcement agencies and counties that have motor vehicle pools theyre trying to work those budgets out theyre getting ready for fiscal year to begin and they dont know exactly what to expect because what they have learned in the past year is that this just might not have a ceiling people thought 3 a gallon might be a ceiling and then they thought 4 a gallon might be a ceiling i talked to some folks here from california last week and they had paid 6 a gallon on pacific coast highway 6 a gallon so there is a concern for what the expectation may be as theyre working up that angle of their budget the other end of it affects our state governments when they are looking at the revenue that comes into their highway trust fund as people are looking to try to find ways to drive less then what they are seeing is that decrease in revenue and saying how is this going to affect us
7506385 uncovers corporate lies rampant confusion in the offices of our politicians and exposes the con in conservative
7506386 communism provides services to the people such as a job a place to live and universal health care
7506387 communism is not what makes china bad it is corporate fascism
7506388 the goal is not to reduce the price of oil but to eliminate it from society
7506389 wouldnt it be great if hillary clinton was nominated for president and we got rid of that little putz
7506390 john mccain is a senile son of a bitch who needs someone to change his depends sanitary pants because he is too stupid to know what it means when his diapers are wet
7506391 the uniform constant and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition sounds like us olympic athletes is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things toward improvement in spite both of the extravagance of government and of the greatest errors of administration
7506392 mccains trigger happy temperament and reactionary policies offer worse than no change
7506393 did his captivity inform a search and destroy shoot first ask questions later we are all georgians mentality
7506394 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7506395 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7506396 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7506397 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7506398 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7506399 this hierarchy represents the extent to which the us should be willing to expend its military power or national treasure in order to defend certain interests
7506400 where shall we lair today for from now we follow new trails
7506401 be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7506402 the statement effectively conceded that berbatov was lost as a player to tottenham and appeared to give manchester united the upper hand in the wrangle
7506403 it was not the unsettled striker who told them he did not want to play
7506404 manchester united are expected to offer an increased bid of 25 million to land disaffected striker dimitar berbatov although it is understood that tottenham have yet to receive a formal offer
7506405 complete an acrimonious move from tottenham hotspur to manchester united within days after the barclays premier league champions finally reopened formal negotiations over the weekend united made a second formal bid in the region of 25 million on saturday august 23 and a deal appears imminent after juande ramos the tottenham head coach declared that the saga must be resolved

7506497 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty
7506498 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7506499 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7506500 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7506501 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7506502 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7506503 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes
7506504 its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7506505 i dont have many but i would like to shoot a tv programme soon
7506506 the french english relationship amuses me as neighbours we criticise each other we mock each other but behind all this we appreciate each other and we respect each other
7506507 id like to watch french women and observe them behind their ovens in their kitchens
7506508 im sure that the rest of the world would love a series on french cuisine directed by an english chef it would be crazy

7506510 we didnt work well enough in the first half and they deserved the lead at half time
7506511 we didnt play at the right tempo and pass the ball like we have been doing and we gave the ball away far too cheaply
7506512 the second half was a lot better and we definitely finished the game the stronger and perhaps could well have won it
7506513 i felt that we needed to make the changes and i toyed with the idea of doing it at half time fortunately they helped us today and wallace particularly showed his quality
7506514 we just need to get him up to the level of fitness the rest of the lads are at which isnt his fault as he started training 10 days behind everyone else
7506515 obviously you want to do well in every game but maybe in the back of your mind you know that its where youre from
7506516 i was just disappointed not to get the goal although i thought we had scored a perfectly good one i need to see it again because there didnt seem too much wrong with it for me
7506517 all credit to palace they defended with their lives they got blocks in they put their head in the way
7506518 i felt that given the territorial advantage we had that we could have maybe picked our final pass a little bit better
7506519 the application and effort was all there theres no doubt about that i was just disappointed we never showed our real quality in the final third and manufactured more openings than what we did
7506520 we just needed that goal and if wed have got one theres no doubt we could have gone on to add to that
7506521 it would have been nice to get the three points but if anyone had offered you a point beforehand crystal palace away is obviously a tough venue but given the events of the day i felt we merited all three
7506522 the opportunities we did have i felt we did enough to win the game
7506523 i thought the first half was quite nervous because palace were searching for a goal and us having lost our opening two games so i think there was a nervousness about both sides

7506530 it got to 75 minutes and i thought that maybe hed had his time and it was time to put benni mccarthy on but hes awesome at holding the ball up and causing problems
7506531 theyve all impressed me and its early doors you dont rush into judgements and it takes a couple of months before you form an opinion on where you want to go

7506627 tony had some good blocks and then he had some blocks he needs to work on
7506628 i thought the effort was there i think he continues to need to work on his technique
7506629 we have a long time before that first game so im contemplating on that
7506630 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7506631 if you were a tree would your leaves be green unless of course you were a pine tree then would your needles be green and if you dont want to talk about the color of your leaves and or needles feel free to tell some other cutesy story and ill guffaw like a senile old man with my teeth in my pocket

7506635 im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not very good with that thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7506636 even when you win games you try to be very critical on it and get it right
7506637 because theres a lot of stuff to get on right away
7506638 sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed
7506639 your backs hurting your knees hurting your shoulders hurting your heads hurting its pretty tough
7506640 when you get beat up and then go lift weights it makes your body feel better
7506641 it feels like every muscle in your body is cramped up and sore
7506642 it hurts to walk if you have steps in your house you dread the fact that you have more than one floor on monday after the game
7506643 its not really until thursday that my bodys kind of coming around to feeling like normal again
7506644 for me to be told i look like the donovan of old what year are you talking about
7506645 those were great years 2000 04 and hopefully we can put 2008 in that category too
7506646 hes made a lot of plays so far but we have to stay patient with him
7506647 he is a rookie hes just learning we havent gone into a full game plan for a regular game im sure that hell be able to handle that but you just want to kind of walk him in slowly and get everybody else opportunities to make plays as well
7506648 its a tough situation to go through especially being at the wide receiver position where you have to do a lot of cuts its going to be tough for him i actually told him to get the surgery because i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7506649 maybe some of those playmakers are already on the roster but have struggled with injuries myself included that have held us back a little
7506650 ive said that we are going to go where 5 and no 36 brian westbrook lead us thats not going to change any time soon i hope

7506679 nu m am certat cu rednic dar nu mai intram in planurile sale tactice
7506680 i want to do what i need to do to get back on the field and keep my condition where it is
7506681 i was frustrated more than anything i wanted to finish up that last little bit of action with the first team out there and get off the field make another play it was frustrating in that respect
7506682 i didnt pay attention to it until you say something about it
7506683 when you have an ankle twist or sprain thats part of the game
7506684 i like to put myself in tough situations in practice so that when game time comes hopefully the game is a lot slower than it is
7506685 ive been rotating from free to strong safety as camps been going on and i knew id have the opportunity to play both and i feel prepared to play free safety so its an opportunity for me to get out there more
7506686 each position has its own techniques and variables you have to master
7506687 if youre going to be a strong safety one week and a free safety the next there are a few things you have to refresh in your mind its not that big a deal
7506688 tony had some good blocks and then he had some blocks he needs to work on
7506689 i thought the effort was there i think he continues to need to work on his technique
7506690 we have a long time before that first game so im contemplating on that
7506691 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7506692 i would say i was frustrated more than anything because i wanted to finish out that last little bit of action with the ones out there and get off the field it was frustrating in that respect
7506693 i dont worry about injuries at all actually theyre going to happen regardless ive had ankle injuries in the past and its the same thing you go out on the field you play ball if you get injured you get treatment and get back on the field thats pretty much the way i am
7506694 i didnt feel anything friday that would tell me anything different than what i was thinking that it was just a sprain
7506695 it feels good to go out there and just to be out there on the field period
7506696 so many times i havent made it to this point healthy its really fun to be out there doing what you love
7506697 the thing i think with our guys that we have i think they can make plays for us hank has shown that greg lewis has shown it jason avants shown it obviously in the game against new england making a nice catch on a td pass youve got to give guys opportunities to make plays call plays for them get em comfortable in the offense get the guys around them comfortable with them there and i think things can work out well
7506698 obviously from a team perspective anytime you lose your guy with 77 catches and over a thousand yards 1 110 thats tough for any offense to replace
7506699 one person just cant replace it at this particular time its really just continuing to involve everybody and spread it around the important factor for us is to make sure we get reggie back and healthy you know you cant lose both of your top receivers we have to at least get reggie back and then when the time comes well get kevin back ready to go
7506700 its just an honor to be able to play receiver and catch balls from him
7506701 they were playing cover 2 and i had to get in the hole and make a great play happen
7506702 it was a great ball by donovan put it in the hole then rodney harrison was right there to make a hit
7506703 i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7506704 you dont want that to linger on and then all of a sudden you tear something else it was good that he got the surgery now and he can start rehabbing now to get himself back out on the field
7506705 he already has control of the offense he knows the playbook inside and out so now he can just go out and do what he does and thats put the throws like hes putting them being able to step into that medium not thinking about it youre seeing what donovan does
7506706 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7506707 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7506708 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7506709 las exigencias de las comisiones de investigaci n no se cumplen
7506710 es un incidente que se produce a muy poquitos meses de uno anterior y que est culminando en una sanci n muy importante
7506711 many analysts have predicted that tech companies will be among the winners during the current economic slowdown and these q2 results bear that out
7506712 highly anticipated new products solid revenues and earnings reports major acquisitions and major investments in wireless and mobile technology all helped tech companies reap extensive positive media coverage
7506713 we cannot afford to trade analog dollars for digital dimes
7506714 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears
7506715 this distortion into a partial and often highly distorted perception of reality is unhealthy and dangerous
7506716 and this was another i braked a little bit early for turn two perhaps because i was keeping an eye on the cars fighting behind but everything felt fine i knew lewis was there but i was pulling away by a couple of tenths every lap the first stint was nothing special really but in the second stint the car felt perfect that won us the race
7506717 but after a couple of laps he felt ok and so resumed his normal programme racing drivers have phenomenal neck muscles so a spasm isnt like it would be for you or i it puts real pressure on one side of the spine
7506718 with two cars going side by side down the pit lane so i would be really surprised to get a penalty because its just racing
7506719 we wouldnt have wanted to win the race that way
7506720 given that i could barely stand up on saturday i feel pretty good
7506721 in todays commercial society its not the medal itself that makes an athlete a hero but the mass media
7506722 and its becoming more and more important for chinese athletes that they should learn to manage their image to learn how to deal with the media they should know that theyre becoming commercial brands
7506723 i think this time womens beach volleyball and womens tennis players may become new idols because people love to watch them but weight lifting and judo players may not get the same attention
7506724 i hope that through this match we can promote the development of this sport in china
7506725 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7506726 do you really need to hit it that hard does it make you feel more like a man
7506727 its people like that who really make you want to lend a hand to others and pay it forward
7506728 im not sure how you describe this place to someone whos never been before its almost too extraordinary for words
7506729 jeg l ste det for to uger siden det er et ret godt manuskript
7506730 p et tidspunkt spurgte lucas mig om jeg nogensinde ville v re interesseret i at instruere noget
7506731 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7506732 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7506733 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility

7506739 we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever thank you to the people of china
7506740 the beijing olympics proceeded smoothly and successfully amid support from the international community
7506741 the games was a historic climax of three decades of china opening to the world
7506742 if i had a story to tell it definitely would be the embrace and hug of georgian and russian athletes on the podium two days after there had been violent clashes in georgia
7506743 we had a splendid athletes village we had state of the art venues we had impeccable competition
7506744 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7506745 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7506746 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful olympic games
7506747 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7506748 where do i sign my is gathering strength to become a team i am all for team playing but i thought i would give the donation concept a head start
7506749 i believe the olympics will make china more open more transparent more tolerant and more confident
7506750 the chinese government has become more confident because of a successful olympics that helps the liberal wing of the leaders they will argue that we should not be so scared of the international media and international integration and also to a certain extent openness or transparency
7506751 after the olympics the reform effort that has been stalled by the pressures of hosting a major international event could be restarted
7506752 if those freedoms can be extended to chinese journalists that could be one of the positive results of the games
7506753 im disappointed but not surprised by the not very substantial measures that the chinese took to remain in line with their commitments for the olympic games
7506754 china was trying to send a message to the outside world that it was willing to take measures to open up but internally the main concern was preserving stability and i dont think that after the games that will change so much
7506755 theyll keep most of the things in place certainly the harassment of the dissidents and we wont see any kind of greater move towards liberalization or opening up or anything like that
7506756 did this change chinas view in the world is this a turning point no it will just reinforce your sense of a party thats completely insecure and lacking a great deal of confidence
7506757 the service was created for organizations with limited it resources and a need to share documents among multiple offices other companies or the public as well as for record centers that are warehousing business documents enabling their availability digitally through the internet for client access

7506763 i want to be healthy i want to improve i want to play tennis i mean i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen but at the moment i dont deserve that spot
7506764 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7506765 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7506766 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7506767 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7506768 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7506769 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
7506770 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7506771 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7506772 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7506773 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7506774 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7506775 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
7506776 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
7506777 i was feeling that its better that i get one game before i start to serve to get a little bit in the match to hit few balls just to feel how im gonna do in the first game not to be too nervous
7506778 when i lost my serve i just lost the advantage
7506779 but i stayed calm and i knew that im gonna eventually get another chance
7506780 this is my 11th final and ive only won twice its starting to really sting you know nine times losing ive got a lot of runner up trophies in my office in my house
7506781 stockholm was in scandinavia it was my first tournament and it was smaller than this
7506782 here its the tournament before the u s open and its a really big tournament you know i have beaten some really great players on my way to win this tournament
7506783 i just didnt have power especially in the third set
7506784 if you are not able to run and fight on the court then youre going to lose the match
7506785 not today but if i compare it to one month ago its much better so i look forward to play the u s open the most important tournament obviously is coming in two days i hope i will stay fresh for each match

7507125 i was disappointed to be told that i could not go back as a driver because my hearing wasnt 100
7507126 but i was delighted when they offered a job in the offices and i was thrilled to take it because it meant i was working with trains and my old workmates again

7507143 the rounds must be conditioned so that the temperature is just right and the propellant is evenly distributed we want to make sure that all the tests are identical
7507144 we have to make sure the ammo fires in all these conditions
7507145 if a gun stops working during a test a group of individuals consisting of government personnel engineers and the gunsmith examine all the evidence in order to determine what caused the stoppage

7507148 any potential defects in the brass will become more apparent due to the reaction of the solution theoretically the test makes it possible to identify flaws in the brass that under normal conditions could only be noticed after a lengthy period of time
7507149 the rounds are put in water and have pressure applied to them this tests the seal of the cartridge in case the ammunition is immersed in water

7507170 we think the people will really see value in being on that list even if they wont see a ticket in their lifetime as you and others have pointed out but theyll see value in being on the list i think
7507171 weve kind of been a one sized shoe fits all with our communication moving forward we want to be very specialized in our communication based on what the fans want from us
7507172 we felt it should be a free thing to be on the list knowing how long it does take to move off the list it just didnt seem fair to charge for it
7507173 just because ive got chipper on the other side and hes leading the league that isnt going to turn my switch on to try to play the game hard
7507174 i play the game hard no matter what no matter whos in town
7507175 its their decision to put me wherever they want to
7507176 obviously when you are the last guy on the team you just want to make people happy
7507177 i think its just a matter of time until he hits hes a good hitter and hes going to hit
7507178 i know for sure for a fact im gonna break out this year
7507179 im gonna do what i do tell the people in philly to get ready i feel like theyve forgotten me i need love from my city
7507180 i cant say i was happy getting hurt but im glad it happened
7507181 the left knee thing went back to west catholic then it got worse at hargrave i never did anything about it ive been working so hard im in the best shape of my life
7507182 i had everything easy in high school this showed me the flip side this is giving me a whole different look at things with the struggles now i appreciate what it takes to be no 1
7507183 weve been battling all camp one things for sure im
7507184 when i get my turn im going to make it happen for myself my family my team and philadelphia thats who i play for i didnt have the success i was hoping for as a freshman sophomore or junior but this year dont even worry about it its gonna be nice
7507185 i wanted to get hit i was looking forward to it i wanted to see how id react
7507186 i broke off a pretty long run got tackled no problems it was a big weight off my shoulder im still good no aches no pains
7507187 hes got that philly mentality id put anything on the line for jim mckenzie and i know hed do the same for me even at his young age hes a leader hes one of the guys giving me confidence
7507188 seeing what hes doing that pushes me if i didnt think making the nfl was still possible for me i wouldnt be playing anymore this is hard work its what pushes me
7507189 if steve slaton can make the nfl curtis boonah brinkley can do it too
7507190 the thing i think with our guys that we have i think they can make plays for us hank has shown that greg lewis has shown it jason avants shown it obviously in the game against new england making a nice catch on a td pass youve got to give guys opportunities to make plays call plays for them get em comfortable in the offense get the guys around them comfortable with them there and i think things can work out well
7507191 obviously from a team perspective anytime you lose your guy with 77 catches and over a thousand yards 1 110 thats tough for any offense to replace
7507192 one person just cant replace it at this particular time its really just continuing to involve everybody and spread it around the important factor for us is to make sure we get reggie back and healthy you know you cant lose both of your top receivers we have to at least get reggie back and then when the time comes well get kevin back ready to go
7507193 its just an honor to be able to play receiver and catch balls from him
7507194 they were playing cover 2 and i had to get in the hole and make a great play happen
7507195 it was a great ball by donovan put it in the hole then rodney harrison was right there to make a hit
7507196 i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7507197 you dont want that to linger on and then all of a sudden you tear something else it was good that he got the surgery now and he can start rehabbing now to get himself back out on the field
7507198 he already has control of the offense he knows the playbook inside and out so now he can just go out and do what he does and thats put the throws like hes putting them being able to step into that medium not thinking about it youre seeing what donovan does
7507199 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7507200 the best line i ever read from you was about me this was after the glory days in 1993 when we were all beat up dutch daulton inky pete incaviglia head dave hollins me we had no chance you knew it anyone who had a clue about baseball knew it the column was in the middle of spring training you wrote and the phillies will have lenny dykstra masquerading in centerfield one more year for some reason that made me laugh so hard because you were so right
7507201 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7507202 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7507203 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7507204 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7507205 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7507206 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7507207 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7507208 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7507209 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7507210 being a fan of philadelphia soccer is almost going to be like a full time job
7507211 soccer is not a spectator sport its a participation sport
7507212 you dont wait for a basehit or a first down to get into it instead of waiting to yell charge after a horn blows you are engaged for a full 90 minutes of people trying to pick up the team themselves and the people around them
7507213 its real important for us to make as many efforts as we can to reach out to our fan base
7507214 we already have 5 000 seat depositors who have no idea what its going to cost no idea where their seats are going to be no idea whos on the team
7507215 for them to give us that kind of commitment weve got to step out and do things in response
7507216 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7507217 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7507218 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7507219 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7507220 to prepare as much as you can and watch a lot of video especially their bullpen guys
7507221 god forbid if someone gets hurt you have to be ready to go in right away you have to be ready at any moment other than that the secret to pinch hitting is that it has to be something you want to do
7507222 on a club thats in a playoff race and they have enough respect to call me up
7507223 brians one of those kind of guys whos so valuable to your team because he can impact it in so many places
7507224 he can play running back or fullback he can start a game for you he can come in on third down and catch a pass for you
7507225 its not easy managing your roster in this league if youve got a true blocking fullback or an undersized tailback theres not a lot else you can do with them but brian can do everything is he going to be great at any of them i dont know but i know hes going to be very very solid for us at everything
7507226 i think his value to this team is just going to keep increasing as he gets more experience and we know exactly what we want to do with him
7507227 when they drafted me they kind of told me they were going to be using me for everything including special teams
7507228 one of the reasons they took me was because they liked my versatility i think im most effective when im in a different role at different times
7507229 i had thought about coming out for the draft after my junior year
7507230 then i came back expecting to get a lot of carries and the ball in my hands and that obviously wasnt the case coach sat me down and talked to me about it he told me that was going to be my role and i accepted it
7507231 it was the best thing for the team i still got the ball in my hands a lot i carried it seven eight times a game and caught it five six times a game it wasnt as much as 30 40 times a game like it was in the past but i was ok with it looking back i think it helped me out in the long run
7507232 for us to be able to see that he could do that play fullback really increased his value with us when we were evaluating him he was going to be billed as a heisman trophy candidate going into his senior year and they basically told him they needed him to take one for the team that really impressed me hes a very unselfish guy
7507233 blocking was tough ac joint sprains here and there then you build up calcium in the joints and they start scraping together but they took all that out and now im as good as new
7507234 he came in and took every practice rep never told us about the pain he was in or the problems he was having
7507235 hes one of the best running backs in the league but its given the rest of us a chance to get a lot of reps which cant do anything but help in the long run
7507236 probably one of the toughest offenses to learn in the league but i love it once you get the grasp of it its great its all about getting the ball in the playmakers hands and weve got a lot of playmakers on this team
7507237 having gone through that before i know it can change
7507238 le manque flagrant dinfrastructures co te chaque ann e linde entre 3 et 4 de son produit int rieur brut
7507239 the best line i ever read from you was about me this was after the glory days in 1993 when we were all beat up dutch daulton inky pete incaviglia head dave hollins me we had no chance you knew it anyone who had a clue about baseball knew it the column was in the middle of spring training you wrote and the phillies will have lenny dykstra masquerading in centerfield one more year for some reason that made me laugh so hard because you were so right
7507240 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7507241 ill present my side ill say that id love to play one series two series
7507242 he may say that its not worth it and so be it
7507243 we hung in there and battled and definitely deserved to win
7507244 games like this if that doesnt inspire you and get you going and give you a lift i dont think you like to play
7507245 sometimes you have it from the start and sometimes you have to get a feel for it
7507246 i got a guy or two on base and had to find it quick i tried to work out of a jam and was fortunate to get out of it with limited damage
7507247 tony had some good blocks and then he had some blocks he needs to work on
7507248 i thought the effort was there i think he continues to need to work on his technique
7507249 we have a long time before that first game so im contemplating on that
7507250 dont you know that 75 percent of the world is covered by water and the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7507251 as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt fully mentally focused
7507252 i like to use the football field and practice and being around the guys as a place to get away but i still had something lingering
7507253 but weve handled it everyone has learned from their mistakes and were ready to move on
7507254 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7507255 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7507256 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder
7507257 it was tough to have a killer instinct when you have other things in your head
7507258 but after the preliminary hearing in may 2007 when no one testified against him and the judge still held him over that was the only time i saw a negative emotion
7507259 the message theyre sending is that football players can do whatever they want and theres no accountability
7507260 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7507261 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that
7507262 i took a peek of it on the internet and i turned it off within minutes
7507263 thats no good for anybody to watch stuff like that
7507264 we need to get home and get on with that now
7507265 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy
7507266 but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7507267 coming here 4 years ago he instilled a sense of belief in our team that we could come back at that time i think we were eighth in the world we didnt win a lot of tournaments it took a couple of years until we started to win some big events
7507268 this match is a culmination of a vision and dream that hugh gave to our team 4 years ago
7507269 it seems so very far away but he talked about it with great conviction his ability to say we need to believe it before it will happen and then that we will need to do the work he impressed that upon us
7507270 im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not very good with that thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7507271 even when you win games you try to be very critical on it and get it right
7507272 because theres a lot of stuff to get on right away
7507273 sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed
7507274 your backs hurting your knees hurting your shoulders hurting your heads hurting its pretty tough
7507275 when you get beat up and then go lift weights it makes your body feel better
7507276 it feels like every muscle in your body is cramped up and sore
7507277 it hurts to walk if you have steps in your house you dread the fact that you have more than one floor on monday after the game
7507278 its not really until thursday that my bodys kind of coming around to feeling like normal again
7507279 youre seeing these kids excited its an opportunity for them to be in the spotlight that a lot of kids dont get that opportunity to be on espn and abc and play in such a prestigious tournament
7507280 all i can say is congratulations good job and aloha
7507281 they gave 100 percent every game it definitely exemplifies what hawaii is all about
7507282 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7507283 this is what we were hoping for and more than what we were expecting
7507284 that chinese dude who ran around the top of the stadium
7507285 i fear this will make americans think chinese are bad
7507286 for me to be told i look like the donovan of old what year are you talking about
7507287 those were great years 2000 04 and hopefully we can put 2008 in that category too
7507288 hes made a lot of plays so far but we have to stay patient with him
7507289 he is a rookie hes just learning we havent gone into a full game plan for a regular game im sure that hell be able to handle that but you just want to kind of walk him in slowly and get everybody else opportunities to make plays as well
7507290 its a tough situation to go through especially being at the wide receiver position where you have to do a lot of cuts its going to be tough for him i actually told him to get the surgery because i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7507291 maybe some of those playmakers are already on the roster but have struggled with injuries myself included that have held us back a little
7507292 ive said that we are going to go where 5 and no 36 brian westbrook lead us thats not going to change any time soon i hope
7507293 i would say i was frustrated more than anything because i wanted to finish out that last little bit of action with the ones out there and get off the field it was frustrating in that respect
7507294 i dont worry about injuries at all actually theyre going to happen regardless ive had ankle injuries in the past and its the same thing you go out on the field you play ball if you get injured you get treatment and get back on the field thats pretty much the way i am
7507295 i didnt feel anything friday that would tell me anything different than what i was thinking that it was just a sprain
7507296 it feels good to go out there and just to be out there on the field period
7507297 so many times i havent made it to this point healthy its really fun to be out there doing what you love
7507298 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7507299 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7507300 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7507301 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7507302 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7507303 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7507304 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7507305 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7507306 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7507307 we hung in there and battled and definitely deserved to win
7507308 games like this if that doesnt inspire you and get you going and give you a lift i dont think you like to play
7507309 sometimes you have it from the start and sometimes you have to get a feel for it
7507310 i got a guy or two on base and had to find it quick i tried to work out of a jam and was fortunate to get out of it with limited damage
7507311 here in beijing the stars and stripes are at half mast
7507312 one of the great successes in u s olympic history
7507313 americans did really well here but we wont be happy
7507314 weve had a couple things happen but it wasnt that we werent performing
7507315 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
7507316 we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes but were not disappointed in any team or individual
7507317 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7507318 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7507319 you have a question of unlimited need and limited resources
7507320 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7507321 and more and more countries are winning them there are only so many to win if the chinese are winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did
7507322 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7507323 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport
7507324 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
7507325 i was impressed at the massive structures but at the same time saddened at what it took to build them how the iraqi people suffered so he could have his luxuries
7507326 walking through all that destruction was like looking at some ancient ruin its hard to believe that just six years ago that was all standing a thriving building now its just in ruins
7507327 i thought the tour was a lot of fun and very educational
7507328 the most interesting part for me was the baath house because they had a swimming pool and used it for killing instead of swimming also the fact that in the middle of the building you could go fishing
7507329 sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple
7507330 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
7507331 it is dealing with salaries problems we have many problems we have infrastructural problems in our state hospitals we have a problem with our personnel and it is a link to the social problems and we have problems with our patients who are very poor people and when they come to the hospital they dont have enough money to payi the costs and so on however for the time being we are tackling the problem of salaries
7507332 if this problem has been tackled before six months ago we were in a general strike at the time from december 2007 to january 2008 for the same salary problem and the government promised at that time that in six months time it was going to re adjust the salaries of state medical doctors but we realized that after six months they government didnt do anything but this time they signed a document promising that they will reach the requirement of all the doctors so we decided to resume work today and wait for this agreement to be implemented
7507333 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7507334 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7507335 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7507336 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7507337 oh how i wish i could do it all again
7507338 when i invited a friend round to mums house for tea he engaged her in conversation about mikhail gorbachev quick as a flash she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7507339 it took us all time to realize that she couldnt remember a newspaper headline she had just read or what shed had for breakfast that morning
7507340 he avoided driving up whitehall because as their car passed downing street she would look up wondering why they hadnt turned in
7507341 it was a tough day but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7507342 i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week
7507343 vijay played a really solid 17th unfortunately i turned my driver just a little too much i didnt think it was that bad
7507344 the way the system works now the next guy that wins can just overtake you its going to be tough
7507345 but im ahead and ive got a head start so i just have to go out there and play consistent solid golf and hopefully win at the end
7507346 was so much blood it looked like a murder scene
7507347 we believe there is weve been studying this area now for eight months
7507348 wed like to do a monitoring tower in porter county if we can get lease agreements with landowners
7507349 we have a couple locations were looking at right now
7507350 people have been made to believe that theyre getting a good deal and that assumption is there because of secrecy
7507351 somebody is getting by with giving somebody 5 000 and then making 90 000 the farmer in north dakota who thinks hes got a good deal has really been lied to
7507352 while mathern is talking about energy development gov hoeven is already doing it
7507353 basically we have out of state corporations coming into our state getting the major profit off this development and our north dakota folks are being left behind
7507354 farmers individually farmers in co ops could make these investments and keep all of that profit
7507355 weve been having to move that 1 500 megawatt goal up because of the tremendous progress were making versus what mathern is talking about which is just pulling a number out of the air
7507356 ultimately the landowner really is able to say to the companies what they are willing to require or not
7507357 okay this is new whats up with this guys voice
7507358 we found approximately five gas cans in and around the area
7507359 were looking at this really close it would suggest that they were trying to steal gas but we want to rule out anything else
7507360 well over half of the nsw wind farms that are likely to be built in the near future as at april 2008 are within a 70km radius of goulburn
7507361 this situation where such a large proportion of the states wind farms have been proposed in a single area is unique in australia
7507362 thanks for the story this is exactly what i needed
7507363 this record has a diverse flow with g rated lyrics some of the songs were recorded especially for this project and some had already been written and we wanted to make it a win win by pairing emerging acts and prot g s with well known acts
7507364 eat sleep f k and drive ffffffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssss stttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt tttttt cause you only have nine
7507365 things that people wouldnt actually expect me to be involved in
7507366 i really feel like getting fucked in the ass today but i dont dig that whole gay lifestyle
7507367 okay honey then ill strap on lil pearl and well do some pegging then
7507368 judes wife fucked him in the ass with a dildo she pegged him hes gonna take his wifes maiden name
7507369 i felt bad it was tough but we were aiming to finish second and i did it
7507370 it was not easy for lewis but he did the job
7507371 again we suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7507372 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7507373 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7507374 the most positive element for us was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend
7507375 we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everyone thought would be full of crashes
7507376 now we can work hard for the final third of the season which begins with the back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7507377 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7507378 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7507379 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations we dont need arrogance on the part of any of the parties we need maturity and harmony and not acrimony
7507380 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition

7507388 we are disappointed that the department for business is not minded to use its powers to limit the damage that high charges could do
7507389 we need to be clear that high charges will undermine our efforts to establish a thriving and diverse renewables industry in scotland
7507390 they would prevent the deployment of large wind farms in the islands and north of scotland and threaten the successful deployment of scotlands first and therefore most important fleet of wave and tidal projects
7507391 scotland is united against the national grids electricity transmission charging regime which works against the development of clean renewable energy in scotland
7507392 the scottish government scottishpower scottish and southern energy and the scottish renewables forum have already presented an unanswerable case to ofgem who responded positively to the need for change
7507393 the national grid have told us that they accepted the need for a review of charging
7507394 we will continue pushing our case for scotland until we have removed this unnecessary barrier to clean renewable energy
7507395 they are trying to produce power in areas away from demand centres and they are being charged unduly
7507396 i think we are definitely at risk of not meeting our targets unless we find solutions to these issues
7507397 our evidence base suggests the current level of transmission charges would not prevent otherwise economically viable renewable projects being built even in the extremities of scotland as shown by the significant capacity awaiting connection
7507398 we are clear that transmission charging levied on a user should continue to reflect the costs that user imposes on the network to get their flow of energy to the end user
7507399 this is because the further a source of gas or electricity is from its end user the more it costs to transport that energy to them
7507400 they attach substantial value to the on the ground experience of local management
7507401 no retention payments merger completion bonuses or incentive payments in place
7507402 if we are serious about reducing pollution promoting environmentally friendly power and reducing our dependence on foreign oil which funds terrorism throughout the world then we should support wind energy
7507403 we can start right here on staten island fresh kills one of the countrys worst ecological nightmares is poised to become new york citys first wind farm it is the only site in the city that has been tested and proven suitable for a wind farm
7507404 pending state and city approvals the seven 400 foot turbines could generate 17 megawatts of energy enough to power 5 000 homes
7507405 it would take 4 3 million gallons of oil per year to achieve this electric production with oil at more than 100 a barrel today the energy costs would be staggering
7507406 i have heard every possible excuse as to why this project cannot progress ranging from the ridiculous windmills kill too many birds to the physically incorrect landfills cannot physically support windmills
7507407 i think we miss the boat an awful lot because we let really talented young ones go by the wayside
7507408 a lot of nations approach the talented youngsters a lot younger than we do
7507409 the governing bodies tend to say theyre too young to be funded now because they might never make it
7507410 we dont go in there and identify them young and put them in the national squad at the age of 13 or 14
7507411 we as a sport wait until 17 18 and then start putting them into squads and on funding
7507412 and its not just for 2012 were also looking at glasgow in 2014 we want a really strong scottish team and if thats the case you have to be looking at your 18 year olds
7507413 the best at their disciplines and their sports have to be funded and trained in the right manner so that in the next 4 6 years theyre peaking the older ones are not going to peak at that time
7507414 the governing bodies have to get it right now because if weve got the whole nation behind us supporting 2012 and the whole of scotland behind us supporting 2014 and we dont get any medals then youre going to let the whole nation down
7507415 everyone gets really excited when they start seeing people getting the medals you saw that this year
7507416 people would be talking about sports that they had never even watched before because somebody got a gold medal in it it just catapults your sport to a whole new level and theres more attention put to that sport
7507417 i think a lot of people could learn how to put the games on from the chinese they did a great job
7507418 it was very much suited to the athletes that were there and the medal haul of team gb seems pretty successful
7507419 were going in the right direction with the sports that weve got in great britain obviously some sports didnt fulfil their medal haul but most of the sports did really well and it just shows especially looking towards 2012 that were on the right pathway for being successful
7507420 some of the scottish participants in the different disciplines did exceptionally well i think we can have a really positive attitude now that weve got some good scottish role medals coming back with medals which are going to really inspire the kids of scotland
7507421 i see it already from the people that i coach that are at a good standard whereas before they would be saying id love to be on the olympic team and id love to be part of it all theyre now saying i could probably get a medal too if i work hard
7507422 there is a major shortage of trained medical professionals and nurses in the country and this is a major challenge for us in providing healthcare services to the people of india
7507423 we need to address these issues both at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are no shortages of doctors and nurses it is heartening that assam is taking the lead in setting up medical colleges
7507424 assam is taking the lead in showing the rest of india in terms of providing adequate healthcare delivery especially in the rural sector
7507425 the results of the national rural health mission nrhm in assam were very encouraging and the state government needs to be complimented for it
7507426 the medical college will go a long way in further boosting the healthcare facilities in the state
7507427 the prime minister will lay the foundation stone of the bodoland university a planetarium and a science museum cum childrens park in kokrajhar
7507428 we are expecting about 1 000 guests at the wedding reception

7507430 when this games ends its not ending but a new beginning for many of us
7507431 the incident took place at around 10 pm on sunday the accused sanjay 30 reached his house at sunlight colony and told his mother in law that he had come to meet his wife meenu
7507432 he then entered meenus room and shot her she died on the spot
7507433 she was staying with her parents since last few months and was preparing to file for divorce
7507434 what kind of father would demand the death of a son
7507435 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7507436 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7507437 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7507438 as they approached they noticed one of the males a 17 year old had what appeared to be the butt of a gun sticking from his waistband area
7507439 they ordered him not to move to drop it but as he reached for the firearm one officer discharged
7507440 she went into shock last night when they had to tell her what happened
7507441 they answered her cell phone and told us to come to einstein
7507442 he was very energetic smart and just a burst of energy
7507443 he was a happy little kid and all the kids loved him
7507444 it was like magnets with them and when they had my nephew that was like life for them right there
7507445 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7507446 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7507447 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7507448 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7507449 obama has effectively checked mccain on mccains only relevant argument by choosing biden who has more foreign policy and washington experience than mccain
7507450 while all of us are quite proud to see our contingent returning with three medals i do not think that we can feel complacent about out performance
7507451 we have to start working on a war footing if we have to give a better performance in london and that is possible provided the right application is there and we tap young talent
7507452 when a country like jamaica with a population of 28 lakh can come out with such a good show why not india
7507453 jamaica provides training from the primary school level and particularly concentrates on athletics
7507454 jesus came to his friends and said god has made me the boss of everything and everyone so everywhere you go urge everybody to follow me and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teach them to obey everything i have told you

7507459 my administration will ensure that the goals of the state vision 2020 concept are realised
7507460 there are so many things that need to be unbundled so that the ministry can work independently
7507461 in a country such as nigeria with a population of over 140 million issues of housing regional planning and urban settlement should constitute a major headache to a ministry
7507462 amchud is a new organisation without a funding structure prior to this development south africa has been the one chairing the activities since 2005
7507463 it is important to view it as an important process of improving human settlement
7507464 as the chairman of amchud it is my vision to strengthen the existing structure for operation instead of relying on donor agencies
7507465 all the funds used for the conference was source from the private sector that was why south africa held the secretariat for so long
7507466 we have noticed some frivolous move by the council to downgrade our institution in the name of non provision of required facilities by the university
7507467 we have provided laboratories teaching hospital qualified teachers including four professors and enough classrooms to accommodate our staff
7507468 though professional accreditation is important we will not succumb to any politics or lobbying
7507469 our concern is to train veterinary doctors for the benefit of the country
7507470 the students are not exposed to clinicals which is the major component of veterinary studies as they are now using temporary facilities
7507471 our district a townwide district of critical planning concern has the same weight as the energy district and weve done all the introductory effort at this point
7507472 we want to make it totally understandable simplify it and bring it to the community
7507473 there are several attorneys in the group theyre all volunteers
7507474 i spent nine months working on it i think maybe its time to step back and allow fresh voices
7507475 if they can come up with something easier to understand thats more palatable
7507476 as long as i feel the protection of the town is still in place i dont care
7507477 if things are being done theyre not talking about it
7507478 but we cant do much until we get the regulation
7507479 we can go back to the marthas vineyard commission if necessary to reinstate the energy district but not until the town embraces it would i go back
7507480 my goal is to have an all island energy bylaw i said that several years ago
7507481 i am a member of a walking club on many occasions our walks take us to the lovely weaver valley walking through the leafy lanes of aston grange farm
7507482 the woodland trust have been planting trees wild flower meadows and boggy areas to encourage bird life how sad if the investment in these new habitats were to be wasted because of the effects of the turbines
7507483 this is a totally unspoilt area and i would be sorry to see it desecrated by this massive development it would deter visitors and jeopardise both tourism and local employment to desecrate an area enjoyed by so many is unacceptable
7507484 the proposed 125 metre turbines are the biggest size yet used in multiple onshore installations in the uk and this would be far larger than any group yet built in north wales or north west england
7507485 the turbines would appear out of scale and out of character the weaver valley itself provides delightful and tranquil walks while the river has a wide variety of leisure users
7507486 bartington hall is a grade two listed building which dates back to the early 1700s and has a rich history
7507487 we bought the property in 1987 and set about renovating it in a specific way to preserve its appearance it is about 17 metres high and the erection of these superstructures at some seven times its height would have a hugely adverse impact on the setting of the building
7507488 i believe that the wind turbines do kill birds of prey and bats and i am very concerned about this
7507489 i am deeply worried that our historic and beautiful landscape will be compromised forever and that our children will look back at these planning decisions in horror
7507490 the eight mile aston ring bridleway is exceptionally valuable in a county which provides poor access for horse riders
7507491 a horses response to a threat is flight not fight and to the horses reaction blades turning can represent an airborne predator swooping on them
7507492 the bridleway is under grave threat of falling into disuse and riders too afraid to take their horses onto the bridleway riders will be forced to ride on unsafe roads or give up riding altogether
7507493 we note with sadness the recent rise of kidnapping in our states the situation is alarming not so much by its frequency as by its attendant terror and trauma
7507494 if eventually they decide to carry out their plans the central senatorial district will never produce the governor of this state in the next hundred years
7507495 over sight role assigned to the legislative arm by section 128 which gave us right to invite state commissioners to tell us how they have performed so far
7507496 the day the commissioners were confirmed i did inform them that after they completed one year in office we are going to call them to come and brief the house on their activities why would any one think that it was because of the crisis in the pdp that we are doing our work you cannot again rule out that fact that some certain characters are blackmailing us and trying to stop us from doing our work

7507498 spring another round of crisis in the region that the federal government will not be able to curtail at the end of the day
7507499 niger delta are opposed to the idea of piping their gas to develop other regions other than the niger delta
7507500 there is no fairness justice and equity which are principle of the rule of law as being canvassed by mr president
7507501 we want the gas plant to be located in the region and federal government should develop the gas plants in delta bayelsa and rivers this will create employment for our people and especially the youths
7507502 contribution towards exposing corrupt practices and sustaining the fight against corruption in the country
7507503 the reality though is that the fight against corruption poses grave and unpredictable risks to those who dare to challenge this gargantuan monster
7507504 we must expect resistance from well entrenched beneficiaries of the existing system protagonists of the anti corruption crusade should not expect to be congratulated by powerful existing interests in spite of great odds however i strongly believe that the battle against corruption can be won in our life time in nigeria
7507505 the greater part of the nigerian problem is the ruling elite selfish greedy unpatriotic and often lawless
7507506 it is a crime against humanity depriving citizens of education employment opportunities health care water food roads and electric power grand corruption has denied nigeria every opportunity for economic advancement
7507507 we the undersigned traditional riulers for and on behalf of the entire ijaw nationality in delta state of nigeria wish to state without equivocation that the modus operandi devised by the commission in the delimitation exercise calls for a very serious concern it is crystal clear that the commission has no single regard for the ijaw of delta state the procedures and proposals used are totally unacceptable as they are geared towards marginalizing the ijaw we were perplexed to understand that out of the eleven house of assembly constituencies allocated to delta state not even a single one was allotted to either burutu bomadi patani nor the ijaw of warri south warri south west and warri north local government areas respectively
7507508 to our greatest chagrin the commission anchored its exercise on just one criterion i e population
7507509 the reality show produced 30 finalists who were camped for 45 days in order to groom and model them into a formidable youth team the 30 were later pruned to 15 who now constitute the fash fc the new team has played a number of friendly games and proved its mettle against other teams who had played together for a long time

7507512 we had the team to win gold here but the players couldnt lift their game to the level that would have assured that thats what makes the defeat painful to me not necessarily the loss
7507513 some of the players couldnt lift their game against argentina
7507514 we are monitoring the 34 centres with 540 candidates each in the state i believe that more suspects will be caught especially from the hinterland areas
7507515 i am impressed by the level of commitment shown by the officers and men of the corps and the success recorded in checking examination malpractice
7507516 this school has shown that it is the flagship of secondary education in the south east
7507517 it is saddening to note that about 80 percent defaulters of ground rents and taxes in the state are affluent people and this not helping us in our revenue generation
7507518 the state government had set n300 million as target monthly for internally generated revenue and the board is determined to ensure total compliance to all tax laws and as well total commitment to meet the target
7507519 over time we have articulated and packaged our submissions to the federal government by writing relevant agencies ministries and related authorities over what we have been going through in the hands of vandals and thieves who steal and damage our facilities and the need to give some kind of protection so we can focus on delivering our promises to the subscribers
7507520 we can not fold our arms and watch things continue the way they are going
7507521 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7507538 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty
7507539 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7507540 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7507541 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7507542 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7507543 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7507544 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes
7507545 its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7507546 i dont have many but i would like to shoot a tv programme soon
7507547 the french english relationship amuses me as neighbours we criticise each other we mock each other but behind all this we appreciate each other and we respect each other

7507559 when trade flares up as a political issue as it is likely to do in the presidential campaign this year one aspect of the debate is almost always neglected there is a fierce competition among foreign countries to sell their products here in the united states the largest commercial market in the world moreover by opening up our market to muslim countries we could not only help american consumers but also serve a larger strategic goal that of boosting the economies which now produce large pools of unemployed embittered youth we can make trade an effective weapon against terrorism our tariff regime puts many nations in the middle east whose young people are susceptible to the sirens of islamic fundamentalism at an unintended disadvantage this works against our efforts to stamp out jihadism fortunately the problem is easy to fix the u s buys about a fifth of all the goods and services traded world wide importing 2 63 trillion worth of the worlds products last year alone socks come in from the caribbean towels from pakistan cheese from france and oil from saudi arabia but apart from oil very little comes from the muslim world the 30 majority muslim states of the greater middle east from morocco through egypt to pakistan and central asia account for about 10 of the worlds population they provide about 1 of our manufactured imports and an even smaller fraction of our farm imports

7507811 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample

7507821 girl you know that comes with the territory youve gotta get used to it all kinds of hoes are going to be all up in his face
7507822 i wonder who she is though she didnt look like a video girl
7507823 i dont give a fuck who she is if i go back out there and see her with tyrell again theres gonna be some problems
7507824 well apparently that wont be necessary since she is right here
7507825 doesnt this whole situation remind you of something that would happen in college
7507826 well i know back in college i was good for smacking the taste out of the mouths of bitches who talked shit about me behind my back these days though im more the type to slap the shit out of bitches in bathrooms and then have said bitches removed from this party because when youre a senior level nba executive you can do that id then have them banned from all nba parties and what a shame that would be because if i did that then that just might make room for one of the six video hoes who have conspicuously slid their numbers to a certain basketball player via his agent to take the place of a certain girlfriend
7507827 i cant party effectively with my friends or linkshell members because our levels are too far apart

7507833 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7507834 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
7507835 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars

7507844 what we used to call before the multicultural age facts
7507845 ive heard the rumours but they dont bother me in the slightest its a load of absolute nonsense a lot of it is down to jealousy
7507846 if you take all the airports in ireland all the little ones and the big ones
7507847 we have staff in weston who have worked there since even before we bought it and like the guards on the beat on the street who know everything thats happening these people are there all the time and they know all the different people coming in and out and i would say that not one drug has ever come through
7507848 the people who are spreading these rumours are definitely liars in my opinion because they have no such proof and if they have then the police should know about it or we should know about it
7507849 i would love to get someone who could tell me directly some policeman or someone else about who is spreading these rumours about me and drugs not for money or anything but id love to take them out and i would bring them to court because theres no drugs in my business
7507850 there was so much inaccurate and misleading information at the time stories were printed that the drugs were found on the plane but no such thing ever happened the drugs were seized before they even entered the airport in belgium
7507851 there was even a story that my plane had been locked up along with the pilots at a time when it was actually in ireland and indeed was being flown around europe the pilots had been released and were at home with their families for more than a week when this report came out
7507852 people have claimed that there is no customs or security nothing could be further from the truth weston is one of the most secure airports in the country we have state of the art facilities better than many airports in ireland and even europe
7507853 at great expense we voluntarily installed x ray machines for baggage and people going through the airport and these machines can even detect drugs
7507854 there is also a dedicated office for customs at weston and we have an excellent working relationship with both customs and the gardai
7507855 and anyone that says that i can say straight out to them that they are absolute liars
7507856 katy frenchs death had absolutely nothing to do with me or my family i felt very sorry for her and for the family she seemed a very nice person but other than that it didnt affect me at all
7507857 i would have met katy three times in my life i thought she was a very nice girl and that her death was very sad i suppose all those types of people take some sort of drugs which is terrible really and jimmy my middle lad would have known her well but not that well
7507858 he would have known her for two or three months through andrea roche jim mansfields daughter in law because she would have held the beauty contests here in citywest
7507859 i heard rumours that it linked back to jim junior a few people said this that and the other about jimmy and the drugs but maybe it was lucky he was away that week he was in
7507860 ive heard people say he was with her that night and all this sort of thing but i happen to know he wasnt with her that night because he was away in spain
7507861 none of my sons have ever ever taken drugs i can sit here and honestly say that i would never have had to talk to any of them about drugs in my life because they are simply not that way inclined theyre always too busy doing something else
7507862 im improving now hopefully ill live another while i keep looking forward i seldom ever look back i like what i do and i like to be able to do it ive no great interest in going for holidays in the sun
7507863 i start now at 6 30am every morning and finish up early at 11pm each night but i did have a holiday there a few weeks ago i went off on a friday evening and i came back on a sunday
7507864 i love looking at antiques and going to auctions and getting things done up
7507865 i have a collection of antique aircraft which includes american president eisenhowers
7507866 i want to let all the people see and believe that what i decided to do when i first went into weston and my plans to make it a model airport have been done we have succeeded to a great extent so far and what were doing now will help that greatly
7507867 its probably a form of madness for me to be able to improve a property is a big thing
7507868 when i see all the people around who have lovely properties just lying there and dont bother about it i do wonder if i am mad
7507869 its unbelievable that there are so many beautiful properties around ireland just lying there down around
7507870 i dont feel i ever get stressed about things the doctors are telling me i should be doing this and that and i shouldnt be here at the office but stress to me is when a doctor tells me i have to stay at home i cant ever see myself stopping work as long as im able to do it i will do it
7507871 it feels like when i was a young lad going to school if you got a half a crown you felt great and the few quid youd have would still feel like that to be able to have it is a good thing
7507872 if money gets you to the stage where you forget about the people who are important to you and your friends from school youre then lost
7507873 i have money in property and in this and that but at the end of the day it means nothing to me really its no motivation at all to me i get satisfaction from what i do and it all coming right
7507874 money wouldnt come on my list of priorities at all all i want is to be able to get a bit of money to eat every week and thatll keep me going the family is my top priority i love to have them all together and were all very close
7507875 i certainly want a new heart and i cant get it something to keep me going a bit longer
7507876 theres nothing that i have ever done that would ever keep me awake at night
7507877 when i look back at everything i dont think i really have any regrets i couldnt find much fault with anything ive done

7507890 we oppose booze bans and all other paternalistic regulation of public space
7507891 we believe public space should be exactly that a place where we can come together as a public
7507892 these bans have generally been introduced not with big public debate or not with big public discussion not as a result of public demand but actually by councils being a bit too bureaucratic a bit too scared of people getting together

7507894 the first few years we drank way too much we were hurting for days ill never forget one habanero sauce that knocked me out and i had to stop tasting for a solid twenty minutes

7507896 the challenge has nothing to do with gender the challenge has to do with coming to a new part of the world and learning a new culture a new language in part because i dont speak maori at the moment and learning to steer the good ship christchurch wherever god would have her sail

7507922 its quite a subtle business attracting people into a new area and into maori culture where they may not have a good understanding of what that culture entails or what it is they might be getting when they buy a product its not a straightforward business you cant just develop a business and expect people to come theres a lot of work in the marketing and selling it to people

7507933 we assume that geniuses are blessed creatures who dont have to work hard to achieve their goals but bobby put in nearly 15 hours a day of brain power and concentration that would kill an ordinary person at least for me
7507934 when he returned to my show after beating spassky he said it might be wise to develop the rest of himself he began to see that a life of nothing but chess was kind of limited
7507935 when i asked about women he said the awful demands of global travel constant study punishing five hour sessions day after day made it pretty hard to have a relationship
7507936 my image of a chess genius was not flattering i pictured a wizened youth with messy hair and unattended acne instead bobby was tall and handsome with football shoulders well dressed gangling and a little awkward he was 6 2
7507937 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7507938 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7507939 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7507940 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7507941 i did not know anything about his studies or research

7507948 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7507949 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7507950 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7507951 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7507952 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7507953 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7507954 instead of saying these are dangerous vehicles or high risk vehicles so dont use them maybe we should be focusing on the vehicles themselves why are they high risk what can be done with them from a product safety point of view
7507955 the question i think has to be raised from a federal point of view from product safety are these safe recreational products

7507960 we have seen several programmes aimed at resolving a potential conflict on the runway both in the us and europe but we are proud to be the first to ever provide a solution that is capable of telling the pilot what to do
7507961 our studies have shown that telling the pilot what to do is fundamental in such circumstances during take off and landing as the crew is concentrating on demanding and pressing responsibilities during these phases of flight

7507977 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7507978 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7507979 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today

7508013 right from the beginning we have sat down at the start of a season and written down his target times i remember the first year we did it he went to a meet six months later and swam those exact times i had never seen anything like it but hes been doing it ever since
7508014 i asked him about it afterwards and do you know what he told me bob i didnt even notice he was there
7508015 michael deals with pressure and expectation better than anybody else i have ever met
7508016 he also has a knack of knowing exactly how much emotional energy to use for any given race so for a prelim its not much but for a final its everything
7508017 michael has transcended his sport hes even transcended the olympics there arent many people who have done that tiger and golf is one its a remarkable achievement he was very marketable before the games so his value has sky rocketed now

7508101 thats dog shit kid dont let anyone ever tell you different
7508102 i thought we were a bit casual in the game we gave away a couple of soft wickets i dont think we deserved to win the game because we made too many mistakes in the game especially with the bat
7508103 the bowlers bowled really well upfront picked up wickets and 225 235 is a good score to chase down but we lost four wickets in 15 overs from there it was a pretty uphill task we came close but not good enough
7508104 every cricketer goes through a bit of hiccups in one or two games but these are quality players i am sure they will get back into form just need to find out how we can handle these situations bit better
7508105 it is a tough position after trailing 1 2 to be in but it is a good challenge for us playing at home you do not want to lose a series so we know where we are going wrong and hopefully we can get it right
7508106 you guys didnt say that when he was scoring in the asia cup three hundreds in a row that is the way the game goes kumar is a good player what we are trying to do is our best batters to bat the most number of overs sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
7508107 when they indians were 63 for 3 i wanted to attack a bit more to pick up wickets and naturally we had to give away a few runs on another day we probably would have been a bit more defensive and the indian batsmen would not have got those big shots away
7508108 i am pleased with the way the two spinners bowled they went for 50 runs but lot of guys do go for that kind of scores these days these are two exceptional spinners and i am sure they well come back strongly
7508109 we want him to be a good bowler but he is showing good quality with the bat as well lower down the order it will be very handy for us if he can manage to be aggressive both with the ball and the bat that will be great so more matches these guys are playing they are going to be exposed to international cricket more and they will learn more
7508110 at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough but you cannot really do anything about it your concentration level has to be up all the time it is very draining but that is what international cricket is all about
7508111 i have proven myself against australia in the past and was looking forward to play against them australia a but i have absolutely no clue what could be the reason for not picking me after being in the loop and being called up for the camp in bangalore
7508112 i am the highest run getter last season with 1339 runs and if you add limited overs runs it would tally to 1700 what more can i do to draw selectors attention
7508113 it would have been a good opportunity for me to be in the reckoning for the series against australia in october by playing against the testing opposition it is sad that there is no hope now

7508258 i think it is a distinct possibility that mccain will choose him it will please far more conservatives than it will annoy
7508259 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
7508260 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
7508261 has become unreasonably wedded to a year old proposal to rapidly withdraw all u s combat forces from the country a plan offered when he wrongly believed that the situation would only worsen as long as american troops remained
7508262 the age of turbulence but the story he tells is one of the amazing resilience of the american economy
7508263 this liberal will be all about socializing uh uh would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies

7508269 in working with adlib software for the past four years ive had first hand experience seeing its document transformation products in action
7508270 adlib software is one of the select few partners out there that has great software that just plain works it plays a critical role in my customers deployments and the company has been available to answer support questions adlib has been a great addition to our portfolio
7508271 with the demand for our products reaching new heights it is a perfect time to reevaluate the importance of our var channel program
7508272 our applications recently went through a transformation making them much more strategic to document workflow solutions as such we see the var channel as the natural mechanism to accelerate the penetration of these solutions into the market
7508273 thousands of customers use adlib every day to improve a variety of document transformation processes
7508274 the new channel program provides an excellent opportunity for vars to derive new revenue streams from this growing demand and for end users to maximize the value of existing investments
7508275 ecm bpm and many other document centric product categories are driving a lot of revenue for the var community but vars need to look beyond the standard offering through complementary applications that make these solutions better vars that are willing to capitalize on the opportunities afforded to them by offering applications like adlib express server will have a clear advantage and drive a lot more revenue
7508276 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7508277 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7508278 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7508279 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7508280 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7508281 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7508282 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7508283 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7508284 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7508285 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7508286 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7508287 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7508288 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7508289 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you
7508290 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7508291 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch

7508296 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7508297 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7508298 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7508299 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7508300 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7508301 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7508302 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7508303 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you
7508304 os chatos est o em todos os lugares e especialmente quem trabalha com inform tica tem um contato mais
7508305 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7508306 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7508307 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state
7508308 if you made public all the information that the fbi have on this case you will see very high level people going through criminal trials
7508309 they knew exactly what was going on all the time if theyd wanted to they could have blown the whistle on this long ago
7508310 their failure to let amins investigation go forward in 2000 allowed the khan network to continue proliferating unnecessarily for three years and the bomb programmes of libya iran and north korea to make additional headway
7508311 where are all the people connected to the khan network there were at least 50 people in this thing and there are only a handful of people under house arrest did they need three extra years to do that
7508312 and were not going to rest until you are stopped
7508313 what message does that send when you try to recruit other informants
7508314 detailed construction plans for nuclear weapons for gas ultracentrifuges for the enrichment of weapons grade uranium as well as for guided missile delivery systems
7508315 under all circumstances this information was not to reach the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
7508316 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7508317 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7508318 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7508319 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case
7508320 it is impossible to make any schedule since the case is in many aspects extraordinary
7508321 o asilo existiu por mais de um s culo e no ex rcito quase nada se comenta sobre ele

7508325 se trat de la reuni n del jefe jur dico de palacio con un reconocido paramilitar que hace parte de la oficina de envigado para hablar de pruebas fabricadas contra la cote suprema de justicia
7508326 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7508327 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7508328 wii steps up to the plate the only place youll see a certain golf superstar this year is in 09

7508335 we are facing a critical situation when many other states have offered the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur which we cannot afford to lose
7508336 land rovers are present in small numbers in mumbai currently our colleagues at jlr jaguar land rover have chalked out plans for expansion in the country within a one year timeframe which will be followed by the entry of jaguar
7508337 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7508338 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7508339 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7508340 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7508341 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7508342 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7508343 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door

7508347 damos la bienvenida a cualquier esfuerzo encabezado por el sector privado para ser global pero podr a no ser apropiado que una instituci n financiera controlada por el estado tomara el rol de l der y adoptara excesivas cargas
7508348 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7508349 said frank oreilly a member of the school board and former lakeland mayor and city commissioner
7508350 its really hard you have all these men and women working their butts off and then you have such a small turnout
7508351 i really compliment everyone out there men and women who are running most people would rather have a root canal than listen to you talking about the election during the summer
7508352 talk about putting signs up you feel like you put all your signs up three or four times
7508353 i was real glad this time that the hurricane tropical storm fay missed us
7508354 crossing the ts and dotting the is it kind of relieves some of the pent up energy you get
7508355 if its not meant to be its not meant to be
7508356 you want to know a lot of it on why im still here
7508357 its mr g ralph gilchrest hes the best principal ive ever worked under supportive will bend over backward to get what he can get for you hes been real supportive of the football program and hes real supportive of all athletics he knows what it takes to build a football program and he knows how important a football program can be to a school
7508358 we would go to football practice then go home and eat then go coach the youth team
7508359 it was a small town he was the head coach there for like 100 years i remember when i was in the fifth or sixth grade we lived two blocks from the high school i would go watch them practice and i wouldnt miss a dadgum game my dad would take me and my brother to every away game
7508360 a lot of times it was easier to go talk to him than it was to talk to my parents
7508361 he probably doesnt even know that i feel like i do about him
7508362 he exhibits the character you want in a head football coach hes willing to roll up his sleeves and do whatever needs to be done thats reflected in his record and how others look at him ive never heard anyone say anything negative about him
7508363 a tradition was started here roughly about nine years ago and i think being able to continue the tradition thats the hardest thing to do
7508364 its easier to come into a program that doesnt have squat and build it up its tougher to say im going to a great program and ive got to continue that because if i dont its a reflection on me on how i can handle kids how i can handle a coaching staff and how i can coach i think i feel prouder that i can continue what was started
7508365 sometimes i think ive gotten a little softer in my old age but it isnt that
7508366 the change in society the change in morals the change in whats going on with these kids families its so different than it was 30 years ago that youve got to understand where the kids are coming from
7508367 you know every friday its going to be competitive at least you hope
7508368 theres some great football programs out there those are the type of things that get you going on friday night at any given time if youre not playing well any of those jokers are going to beat your butt there are good football coaches at all those places
7508369 thats exciting it makes you nervous youre not sure how your kids are going to do you dont know if youre going to control the great athletes that other teams might have you dont know how your knuckleheads are going to play that night
7508370 thats part of high school football its really what its all about

7508375 they missed a tremendous opportunity to really take the initiative and make it a reality
7508376 it was like they were trying not to reach me
7508377 what would give this body the right to add five more years five more weeks or five more minutes to someones sentence handed down by a judge and jury
7508378 the city told us this is not a flood area
7508379 this is a brick and mortar structure its a real school
7508380 weve got people pounding on our door wanting to come in but well meet with the community and churches to see what they really need in there

7508386 at first i played with wild venomous snakes i thought i would get something safer
7508387 i like snakes because theyre all slithery and they slither around
7508388 you can get them to the point where they remember their name
7508389 they dont see a lot of stability but i think seeing that we are here every day gives them a sense of belonging
7508390 we are blessed to have them and that they take time out of their day
7508391 are people who will do anything and will do the best they can
7508392 it gives you a little insight into what they go through and makes you appreciate your own life more
7508393 it makes me feel good it makes me feel like im doing something worthwhile

7508401 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7508402 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7508403 if a ruler extensively confers benefit on the people and can bring salvation to all what do you think of him would you call him a man of humanity
7508404 why only a man of humanity he is without doubt a sage evan yao and shun sage emperors of the shang dynasty to 1751 1112 bc fall short of it a man of humanity wishing to be prominent himself also helps others to be prominent to be able to judge others by what is near to ourselves may be called the method of realizing humanity
7508405 when men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well they all have a feeling of alarm and distress not to gain friendship with the childs parents nor to seek the praise of their neighbours and friends we see that a man without the feeling of commiseration is not a man the feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humanity
7508406 the original substance pen i of the mind is nothing other than the heavenly principle it is your true self this true self is the master of your physical body with it one lives without it one dies
7508407 is humanity far away as soon as i want it there it is right by me
7508408 if anyone with these four beginnings the feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humanity shame and dislike righteousness deference and compliance propriety right and wrong wisdom in him knows how to give them the fullest extension and development the result will be like fire beginning to burn or a spring beginning to shoot forth when they are fully developed they will be sufficient to protect all people within the four seas the world if they are not developed they will be sufficient even to serve ones parents
7508409 if the highest good is to be sought only in the mind i am afraid not all principles of things in the world will be covered

7508442 nobody is sick of hearing about the next president of the united states in this case youve got john mccain or barack obama and either one of them is going to be the next president and the american public cares deeply who that person is going to be because their home mortgage their jobs whether their kids or themselves is going to be sent into harms way is riding on who that person is going to be somebody says oh im tired of hearing about fill in the blank thats ridiculous theres no evidence that im aware of that people are tired of this at all they may be tired of hearing trivial matters about these people but they want to hear everything substantive about them
7508443 in terms of television coverage its been a year of dominance by openly opinionated people who acknowledge that they are for one candidate or another or for one party or another theres been a diminution of the honest broker and an increase in opinionated coverage i dont think much of anybody is getting fooled my impression is that the audience considers a lot of the hour after hour coverage to be frankly just blather wind festivals thats rooted in my confidence in the audience michel martin host national public radios tell me more correspondents and they are no more diverse than when i was a white house correspondent after i left gwen ifill was there and it was pretty much it i think its disturbing and it shows in the coverage ricocheting from being obsessed with race in coverage and ignoring it reporters worldview plays a role and we should own that and stop pretending that it doesnt
7508444 conventions are all about hope this is really the moment in both parties where there is the most hope and its sort of like the crest of the wave for hope for both of these parties its an interesting moment for people to take a look and see where these parties want to take the country so it makes sense that we would be there
7508445 im always torn by the kind of things people focus on versus the things people say they want to focus on how many pieces do you have to do on economic policy and then hear somebody ask does he wear a flag lapel pin the difference is people for whom specific policies are very important like pro life voters or african americans who may be focused on stuff like economic policy from that perspective
7508446 theres been a trivialization of the news and that has bled over into coverage of campaign news weve had constant and ever increasing rapidity of trivialization of campaign coverage i think candidates should be put through the wringer but put through on substance what should you do about chinas drive to become a military and economic superpower what will you do on darfur lets talk about specifics and every time you spend 10 minutes talking about the significance of a fist bump you spend less time talking about things that really matter
7508447 i happen to believe that most people dont watch cable tv all day a lot of them go to work we do not produce our program with the idea that people have been watching cable tv all day because we know for a fact they have not been im not knocking cable television what cable tv does and does very well is theyve replaced the wire machines but thats it in newsrooms all over this country everybodys watching cable tv news but in churches all over this country in offices all over this country in schools all over this country theyre not theres all this stuff coming to people all the time they need some place to go where somebody has gone through it for them professionals they trust who say heres what you need to pay attention to over the last 24 hours of news thats what we do

7508471 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue
7508472 we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7508473 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7508474 such heart warming news high level republican associates here are talking about
7508475 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7508476 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7508477 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7508478 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7508479 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7508480 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7508481 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7508482 instead of saying these are dangerous vehicles or high risk vehicles so dont use them maybe we should be focusing on the vehicles themselves why are they high risk what can be done with them from a product safety point of view

7508511 ik wens niet dat ons belastinggeld wordt besteed aan organisaties die democratisch genomen besluiten alsmaar blijven bestrijden
7508512 we hebben in dit land een rechter waar je naartoe kunt als je het niet eens bent met besluiten als die rechter heeft gesproken dan moet je niet doorgaan met buitenparlementaire acties langs de deuren gaan om alsnog de aanleg van de tweede maasvlakte te verhinderen terwijl alle procedures zijn doorlopen daar krijg ik het rambam van

7508517 als andere partijen de tegenkrachten om zeep willen helpen die een maatschappij juist tot een democratie maken dan kunnen ze onze steun vergeten

7508520 wat cramer nu moet doen is de rekenkamer opdracht geven een onderzoek in te stellen naar wat er in al die jaren met subsidiegeld is gedaan
7508521 het financieren van tegenkracht is de kern van een democratie
7508522 het idee achter het geven van subsidie is dat je als overheid niet wordt bestookt door mensen die zomaar iets roepen maar door deskundigen
7508523 wij gebruiken subsidiegeld niet om het kabinetsbeleid te verhinderen meestal gebruiken we subsidies voor publieksacties

7508533 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
7508534 sexual preference or practice is a behavioral issue and therefore is never comparable to race as i have said many times being black is not a behavior and to quote another inspired source i have never met an ex black
7508535 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
7508536 as a black christian these types of remarks are extremely disturbing as they in no way reflect the level of scriptural literacy knowledge of theology history and methods of biblical interpretation bishops and other church leaders should possess
7508537 thats not godly wisdom but rather sheer ignorance have they forgotten that the witness of the bible was an integral part of william wilberforces british evangelical politicians argument for the eradication of the slave trade and later slavery
7508538 slavery is never glorified in scripture and in the new testament it is a situation that should be avoided there is a clear trajectory from conditional practice and tolerance e g exod 21 1 11 deut 23 15 16 etc towards an end where emancipation is a moral imperative in philemon paul makes a compelling case for onesimus a slave to be welcomed as a brother in christ rather than the continuation of his pre imprisonment status as philemons slave the bible is very clear that god has always intended for people of all races cultures and classes to be fully reconciled with him we see this throughout the old testament e g gen 18 17 19 ps 67 4 is 49 6 is 56 7 is 60 3 5 dan 7 14 mal 1 11 and certainly in the new testament e g mt 12 18 mt 28 19 mk 13 10 lk 2 32 etc in acts 15 james justifies the acceptance of the gentiles by the church not solely on the testimonies of peter paul and barnabas but by appealing to scripture c f acts 15 13 21
7508539 a biblical justification of slavery can only be made by ignoring and distorting the spirit letter and trajectory of scripture clearly unacceptable methods for exegesis and formulating hermeneutics
7508540 for the church the matter of homosexual behavior can never be a
7508541 the bottom line is that christians who are not married must accept and embrace celibacy regardless of the intensity or type of their sexual desires
7508542 sexual preference or practice is a behavioral issue and therefore is never comparable to race as i have said many times being black is not a behavior and to quote another inspired source i have never met an ex black
7508543 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
7508544 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
7508545 you cannot compare slavery with homosexuality slavery is a sin homosexuality is not about rights its about how god created you
7508546 weve often misinterpreted scripture weve used scripture to justify slavery the subjugation of women and now were realizing that what the bible initially seems to say about same sex relationships is not actually what were talking about today faithful monogamous lifelong intentioned relationships between people of the same sex
7508547 because they can we have 700 men here do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do the most devout christians beat their wives many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
7508548 mom im going to draw you at the hobspittal having the baby

7508550 relatively slow or backward in mental or emotional development or in academic achievement
7508551 i wont go see the movie i wont go see anything that puts disabled people down
7508552 the portrayal is so over the top and its meant to be funny because its simply poking fun at someone with a mental disability
7508553 we are definitely encouraging people not to fund the movie producers because of the contents of the movie
7508554 in recent interviews youve said that the film is not intended to make light of people with intellectual disabilities but is instead a satire on actors and the industry
7508555 ive seen the movie and the use of words such as retard imbecile and moron and the use of caricature in the depiction of an individual with intellectual disabilities are simply unacceptable
7508556 when people that are in public gawk and stare at us we know whats going on we know what theyre thinking that were stupid
7508557 were smart everybody is smart in their own way whether you have a disability or you dont
7508558 they ask my caretaker questions and my caretaker says she can talk for herself
7508559 im close to so many people with intellectual disabilities and i know what theyre like and know that this was way over the top and i was upset that people view other people that way
7508560 every day depended on whether she went to school then all day we worried did she stay at school all day did she come home this was just not something we could do anymore
7508561 these kids stay home from school one day and then the anxiety builds and builds
7508562 we had one girl who hadnt been to school in two years
7508563 picture it your child is crying and afraid to go to school its pretty darn hard to force them to go to school
7508564 all of a sudden the child stays home with the flu for three days and then doesnt want to go back to school again
7508565 once i had to talk a boy out of his house
7508566 i told him i want to hear you brushing your teeth
7508567 the longer a child suffers from school refusal behavior and is allowed to stay home the more difficult it is to return to school
7508568 its important to seek solutions and get them quickly back on the right track
7508569 its frustrating to admit that a stranger may know your kid better than you but dont wait another day
7508570 every new school we thought it would be different the teachers are different the kids are more mature but dont kid yourself
7508571 a lot of parents become frustrated and home school the kids but that should only be a last resort
7508572 i changed my whole way of thinking now everything isnt such a big deal
7508573 if i can help one kid who is going through what i went through that would be great

7508579 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7508580 we feel confidant that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7508581 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7508582 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7508583 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids

7508758 i have been stealing songs for decades from goyishe rock bands but have never seen such a surge in popularity due to a major league rabbinical ban
7508759 yeah i know i was banned in my day but it really did nothing for me compared to this
7508760 i have the fortune of being sephardy and therefore i am not bound to the ashkenazy hasidic bans while all the other singers are tied in knots i have a chief rabbi that i can go to as a shield against the madness
7508761 i did although cash in somewhat on the whole ban story because they tried to bring me down but couldnt so ultimately i guess i have nothing to be jealous of lifa for

7508765 you see it was bashert from the one above that lifa should become such a big star no ban in the world can take away from someone something that is coming to them everyone thought that the bans were worthless you see chevra they are worth something they helped to bring a poshite yid that is mesameach thousands daily to true gadlus

7508780 we are not starting from scratch and the team is full of confidence and has made me really believe something can happen
7508781 now i am not just looking forward to next sunday but also to the whole season
7508782 we are all optimistic because we have been able to plan and prepare properly the progress has been good and the whole club is prepared
7508783 we have some important players back now and the core of the squad is still here along with the newcomers that have made us all feel strong
7508784 we oppose booze bans and all other paternalistic regulation of public space
7508785 we believe public space should be exactly that a place where we can come together as a public
7508786 these bans have generally been introduced not with big public debate or not with big public discussion not as a result of public demand but actually by councils being a bit too bureaucratic a bit too scared of people getting together
7508787 i have watched distributors and customers alike struggle with slow and dead inventory for years and decided to start researching advanced inventory algorithms my analysis showed that they were backwards for industrial vending so i reworked them to produce radical increases in manufacturing productivity while dramatically cutting costs at the same time based on my knowledge of the industry as well as my experience as both a distributor and shop owner operator i worked with the autocrib development team to integrate these advanced algorithms into autocrib software that will revolutionize the supply chain
7508788 by implementing autocribs demand based ordering system i anticipate that we can cut a million dollars out of our inventory program over the next 12 months
7508789 the time savings of never having to review min max is a major step forward in productivity for both distributors and end users
7508790 furthermore because the system is constantly reviewing demand the system virtually eliminates the possibility of creating any slow or dead inventory this system stops slow and dead inventory before it can be ordered
7508791 chronic pain affects a higher proportion of women than men but unfortunately they are also less likely to receive treatment compared to men
7508792 iasp hopes to provide a voice to these women by drawing attention to this global issue as a first step towards reducing pain and suffering of women around the world
7508793 we have not changed our position namely that the sovereignty of georgia must be respected and for russia to stick to the six point plan and withdraw its forces completely to the august 7 positions
7508794 to withdraw to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
7508795 chronic low back pain can have a significant impact on a persons ability to do the things they enjoy
7508796 this research may offer hope to those dealing with this debilitating condition
7508797 alle betroffenen bereiche sind an der projektplanung und am erstellen des ablaufplans beteiligt deshalb tragen sie das vereinbarte mit
7508798 i think you must have caught marcos on a high when he spoke about the play offs
7508799 whats important for us is that we keep improving and keep increasing the competition in our squad
7508800 that competition is our strength and i think you can see that when you look at the players who werent involved against plymouth
7508801 we need to take things step by step we need to make sure we are competitive in every single game and then see where we are
7508802 to make any predictions in august would be a bit too adventurous we would probably need a magic ball
7508803 you can understand why pundits have been tipping us for relegation
7508804 we are probably working with one of the lowest budgets in the division we are a squad with no experience whatsoever and we have a very young manager
7508805 hell spend the first part of the week with portsmouth hes still carrying a knock but hell be with us on wednesday
7508806 ive had no calls about kevin doyle for probably about two weeks plus now

7508815 i started building a series of powershell scripts for simplifying the process although there are installers available for dotnetnuke they are often out of date and are fairly rigid in how they perform the install using powershell provides a lot of advantages over a traditional installation program i have complete control over the installation in an interactive environment and can change any one of dozens of parameters that control the installation
7508816 at teched i did an interview with kevin remde where i discussed the v2 universal code execution model in detail you can see it at universal code execution model ucem a vision of how powershell scripts can run anywhere anytime in just the right semantics

7508856 i always get asked about penn states recruiting and i dont think its that bad
7508857 i think their recruiting classes have been fine a lot of rankings are based on numbers of recruits and whether you take a quarterback or not and they havent taken one since pat devlin in 2006
7508858 the rankings are artificially low because of the positions being recruited

7508869 cancer doctors you see are really in the business of keeping patients ignorant and uneducated corralling them into barbaric treatments that benefit themselves not their patients while applegate has now lost both breasts and undergone an extremely painful barbaric surgical procedure her cancer doctors have collected enormous sums of cash that they charged her the doctors walk home rich but women walk home maimed and still susceptible to recurring cancer is that really the best modern medicine can offer the answer is yes if you limit yourself to drugs and surgery to get something better you have to turn to advanced natural medicine where anti cancer nutrients are found everywhere in foods herbs and nature
7508870 the cancer industry today operates like society in the 1850s its a male dominated system run by people who exploit women for their own selfish reasons following the womens suffrage movement as new rights started to become available to women more and more women began to attend universities education empowered women with new choices and with that power they were able to rise to new positions of power both in the home and the workplace
7508871 modern medicine wishes to keep women trapped in a system of ignorance and enslavement telling women they need to cut off both breasts to treat cancer is like demanding they stay at home barefoot and pregnant serving as little more than servants of their men
7508872 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it

7508899 there is a suspicion that the companies are in breach of legal obligations to bring down the number of market zones

7508901 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7508902 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7508903 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7508904 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7508905 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7508906 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7508907 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7508908 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

7508911 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
7508912 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
7508913 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
7508914 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
7508915 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
7508916 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
7508917 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
7508918 es gibt sehr gro e einsparm glichkeiten f r klimagase in der landwirtschaft darum muss die landwirtschaft teil der klimapolitik werden

7508922 we can take advantage of our cognitive surplus but only if we start regarding pure consumption as an anomaly and broad participation as the norm this not a dispassionate argument because the stakes are so high we dont get to decide whether we want a new society the changes we are under cant be rolled back nor contained in the present institutional frameworks what we might get to decide is how we want this change to turn out
7508923 understates its enormity the change in the social landscape is altering institutions that have been stable for generations and making possible new kinds of human engagement that have never existed before the results could be a marvel or a catastrophe depending on how seriously we try to shape whats possible

7508937 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7508938 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party and it seems to me that for whatever reason that hasnt been explained a choice was made out of weakness rather than strength
7508939 senator obama had 51 percent of the democratic vote senator clinton had 50 percent of the democratic vote its kind of a no brainer that thats your ticket

7508945 its a hard path but im awfully proud for how carefully you are stepping
7508946 if youre not convinced that i am 100 of what you need and want then you either need more time to figure that out or will have to be content to have gotten the 9 and move on keeping me in your life in whatever capacity you can handle if you are convinced that i am 100 or maybe 99 9 of what it will take to make your life complete then i owe it to you and myself to figure out whether youre my 100 or not especially with you being as perceptive and discerning as you are if you see it then its probably there but why do the circumstances have to be so god awfully difficult and challenging to the very core of my beliefs

7508977 h p v is a sexually transmitted disease and women arent exposed to it until they become sexually active for most young women in the united states that occurs sometime in their mid to late teens
7508978 up to 50 percent of people walking around are currently infected with the high risk type of the human papillomavirus that could lead to cervix cancer
7508979 vaccinating someone at 12 versus 26 makes a big difference in terms of giving those women an opportunity to have more years of life saved
7508980 if you purchase a 30 000 00 car and you keep it for three years then it costs you 10 000 00 a year to own that car plus interest and all kinds of other costs but if you keep it for six years the cost gets cut in half
7508981 if you catch women young before they become sexually active and you can prevent that initial infection youre going to be much more effective from an economic perspective in terms of preventing the cancer

7509186 we saw podcasting in 2005 as a new form of scholarship and we wanted to experiment with how podcasting could support this type of collegial dialogue we have created more than 45 episodes to date and each focuses on one classic noir or neo noir in depth
7509187 shannon currently lives in atlanta so we have to produce the show virtually
7509188 we both record our portion of the podcast on our local machines and he then transfers the raw files over a network and i edit the two feeds into a final compilation and put it online in mp3 format
7509189 we also feel that a major goal of our podcasts is to bridge the fan scholar divide in film noir we feel we have reached out to both fans and scholars of noir by making a podcast that is focused on critical analysis in a lively and engaging fashion

7509217 the city told us this is not a flood area
7509218 it was a flat out no to somebody who never gets a no from anybody on anything
7509219 ive been lucky to work with some great candidates and talented staff
7509220 all i try to do is help develop and stick to a game plan but without talented people to execute it its just worthless paper
7509221 if obama wins plouffe will come out of this smelling very sweet
7509222 but in any case his reputation is going to be enhanced and it was already pretty good
7509223 he didnt grow up at a country club didnt have a classic stroke and had a hitch in his serve but he won a lot of sets 7 5
7509224 youd see his opponent practicing and wouldnt think dave had a chance but hed win a tight match
7509225 he told me he was more interested in practical politics
7509226 he worked harder than everybody and played at least as hard as everybody else
7509227 he was extraordinarily meticulous in a very quiet and methodical way
7509228 it was so close and it really struck me that if any of us had worked a little harder we could have scrounged up another 71 votes
7509229 within a short period of time david had proven himself and convinced everybody
7509230 that struck me as a pretty clever way of muddying things
7509231 every time we would come up with a fairly substantive hit they would have a very fast pushback on something else give him credit he was very disciplined very thoughtful
7509232 this guys the deal real the talent of a generation
7509233 ive worked with some good guys and hes the best ive ever seen hes smart and he believes in what he says i think hed be a great president
7509234 people spend years preparing for this so this is a very untraditional entry
7509235 i thought he had the capacity to try and unite the country and strengthen our relationships with the rest of the world and he has a hopeful message while recognizing that its important for people to understand that we have real struggles
7509236 we tried to find support in every corner of the state thats the holy grail of politics to expand the electorate this is one of the few times it actually worked
7509237 by the middle of february it was clear we were not going to lose
7509238 he understood exactly what it took to be the nominee he had a well developed plan and a well developed plan b he was prepared for a campaign that ended quickly and he was prepared for campaign that went on at length
7509239 youve got to plan for what you want to accomplish that day but your opponent and the press and outside events can interfere the trick is can you still execute your game plan every morning you get on the chair and its like getting on a bucking bronco if you stay upright you have more chances of success
7509240 hes one of those people and you only meet one or two of these people in your life who its easy to say are better than you are at everything

7509244 five to 10 times more people at the end of next year than at the end of this year
7509245 a campaign by gun rights advocates to make it easier to use deadly force in self defense is rapidly winning support across the country as state after state makes it legal for people who feel their lives are in danger to shoot down an attacker whether in a car jacking or just on the street

7509391 in four or five years ulster rugby as a professional outfit will face a massive crisis unless it gets a new stadium
7509392 if we cant compete with other clubs in terms of facilities there is no point forking out money to be at the bottom of the pile
7509393 if we can get ravenhill up to the level we require it along with a national stadium then i think that is the ideal scenario
7509394 ravenhill will also been spiritual home and the majority of our games will be played there

7509434 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7509435 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7509436 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7509437 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7509438 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7509439 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7509440 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

7509445 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7509446 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7509447 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7509448 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7509449 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7509450 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7509451 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7509452 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7509453 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7509454 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7509455 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7509456 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7509457 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7509458 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7509459 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7509460 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7509461 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7509462 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7509463 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7509464 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7509465 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7509466 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7509467 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7509468 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7509469 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7509470 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7509471 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7509472 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7509473 utopia could be reached in my life time had i the power to issue inviolable edicts i would legislate compulsory sterilization of the insane feebleminded revolutionaries half castes
7509474 our investigating officer will visit as soon as possible to establish exactly what the situation is i really dont know the answer at this stage because there are many variables
7509475 it is perfectly legal for example to put up a marquee in your back garden for a wedding
7509476 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7509477 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7509478 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7509479 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7509480 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7509483 barack obama is a liberal with respect to three core concerns
7509484 hes for phasing out our involvement in iraq and not repeating the calamitous error of preventative war he supports moving toward universal health care and hes committed to investments in sustainable fuel and pulling back from oil dependency
7509485 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7509486 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7509487 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7509488 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7509489 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
7509490 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
7509491 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
7509492 the police have arrested our mp for mutare west shuah mudiwa they went into parliament and literally pulled him out and went away with him
7509493 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7509494 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7509495 sunt bucuros sa accept aceasta noua pozitie precum si provocarile ce le implica deoarece piata din romania este foarte dinamica cu un mare potential de crestere
7509496 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

7509498 this is a planning took where all things are going
7509499 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7509500 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7509501 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7509502 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7509503 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7509504 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7509505 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7509506 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7509507 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7509508 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7509509 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

7509514 soyons honn tes les amis il y a malheureusement peu de chances de voir quoi que ce soit de spontan se produire la convention nationale d mocrate
7509515 il y a un sc nario un d cor un clairage tout est con u pour faire passer un message les spectateurs sur place mais aussi les gens dans le monde entier sont consid r s non pas comme des lecteurs mais un public
7509516 une publicit massive pour le parti et son candidat la pr sidence
7509517 la derni re chose que les d mocrates veulent cest du suspense
7509518 les partis sint ressent surtout la fa on dont les choses apparaissent la t l vision
7509519 cest devenu un v nement de divertissement autant que politique
7509520 lun des d fis pour les journalistes est de trouver couvrir quelque chose de passionnant
7509521 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7509522 both parties try to control every minute of the convention as if it were a television show because it is a television show
7509523 that twinkling star over his head has been replaced by an evil cloud
7509524 the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
7509525 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7509526 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7509527 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7509528 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7509529 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7509530 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7509531 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7509532 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7509533 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7509534 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7509535 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7509536 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7509537 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7509538 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7509539 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7509540 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7509541 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7509542 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7509543 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7509544 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7509545 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7509546 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7509547 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7509548 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7509549 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7509550 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7509551 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7509552 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7509553 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7509554 apples singular focus on user experience has resulted in some success in the enterprise without even trying to break into the market
7509555 strong ipod branding and sales have led to greater consumer sales of apple pcs
7509556 in turn this has lured enthusiasts and small workgroups with supple it departments beyond the standard domain of design and media
7509557 enterprises often see macs as expensive solutions that add unwanted variety to an already complex it management and support operation while providing little in additional productivity
7509558 emerging client virtualization solutions shift the focus from standardized hardware to more secure and manageable pc architectures and operations
7509559 laceby from statements made concerning this parish it would seem that its sanitary condition is in a most alarming state some startling disclosures in regard to the neglect of sanitary precautions at laceby in consequence of which the village is rarely free from disease he found two cases of typhoid fever the sufferers being both of the butchers there had been eight interments in six weeks and the inhabitants of some of the houses surrounding the churchyard bitterly complained of its state there had been eleven deaths in nine weeks in a population of about 1000 that the fever was hushed up by the doctors and again called his attention to the state of the churchyard in discussion it was mentioned that an order had already been issued from the home office for the closure of the churchyard as a burial ground on the 24th december next the chairman said it was their duty to put an immediate stop to such practices mr w iles said when the weather was wet and warm too the ooze from the churchyard was dreadful it was explained that the surface had been lowered 2ft 6 in or 3 ft and that the remaining soil was saturated with decomposing animal matter as to fever never being free of the place he knew from certain and reliable information that there had been 100 cases of typhoid fever in the village in one year and if it was not of a low kind to cause deaths it would create pauperism
7509560 almost all year people have been talking about the olympics being a huge boost to online advertising and particularly online video advertising it has not been huge a huge boost and yet as a singular event yeah it has gotten pretty good results
7509561 their version wasnt compatible with some older versions of windows and macintosh and some people couldnt use it from behind firewalls meaning you lost the lunch time crowd who were trying to watch video from the office

7509636 we are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them
7509637 if you look at the number of unique bugs the numbers can be confusing for the 2 6 25 kernel there were 1 300 bugs only half of which only happened once we do fix a lot of bugs but if you look at what we fix its the ones that actually matter

7509705 my experiences at princeton have made me far more aware of my blackness than ever before
7509706 i have found that at princeton no matter how liberal minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me i sometimes feel like a visitor on a campus as if i dont really belong

7509876 one of the defects of nclb is once a school raises its test scores it loses its extra assistance and is on its own
7509877 it shows the short sided view that you can just rush in with additional assistance for a year or two and pull everything out it doesnt recognize these schools are severely challenged by poverty lack of family and unwillingness of teachers to teach in them

7509893 we made it really clear that when we recruit new industry we make sure were not recruiting someone who will be a challenge for other businesses
7509894 we will have to do an analysis of the business plan to make sure nothing poses an unfair advantage over private sector companies

7509901 when the county began its active sign removal efforts last year industry members immediately began to see a significant loss in business and this loss continues today

7509904 we hope to say to the city council how can you help us these are our citizens these are not just kids in school these are our citizens
7509905 who decided to do these two major road construction projects simultaneously doesnt the county know that the south hill and all points south are already heavily congested
7509906 they shut down one road that services the north south route and the entire area pays in delays and frustration what amounts to the second major arterial closure is just salt in the wound it tells me that the county doesnt care enough to plan for its citizens day to day needs
7509907 we spend considerable effort internally and with our contractors to minimize the impacts within projects and between nearby projects
7509908 at the height of the construction season not everything goes as planned
7509909 the sewer excavations exceed 20 feet in depth and the potential for trench wall instability near traffic was of primary concern in our decision
7509910 if there was a less painful way for pierce county to construct these projects we would certainly plan for it

7509916 repet concluzia unanima a fost ca ramanem fideli acestui proiect si ideii de a coagula si fortele pntcd pentru viitoarea campanie electorala in cadrul listei liberale de candidati

7509921 i utilize a functional strength training methodology called crossfit which has proven to make my body dramatically stronger as a whole
7509922 i chose the superior sawtooth 100 mile ultramarathon because of the races reputation within the ultrarunning community
7509923 the mountains are not as tall as some of the west coast races but the terrain is comprised of constant climbing and descending a total of 20 000 feet in total on top of very technical and difficult terrain add in the experience of being engulfed in scenery of unparalleled fall beauty and its hard to imagine a better place to spend thirty hours
7509924 in an era of soaring administrative costs plexis healthcare systems works to establish alliances with partners that will provide substantial benefits to our existing and prospective clients
7509925 the strategic alliance between vargo consultants and plexis provides state government healthcare organizations with the opportunity to capitalize on proven commercial success

7509927 by identifying flexible highly configurable solutions to integrate with and to support existing state and federal programs we can significantly trim down development and implementation costs thus allowing a larger portion of the program dollars to be spent directly on the members healthcare needs

7509929 after spending the past 15 years working closely with and listening to state medicaid program directors ask repeatedly for product based solutions and only have project based deployment solutions available to them its clear that the states want and need new options

7509932 noi nu ne bucuram de raul altuia dar daca regulamentul va fi rastalmacit si nu se va aplica in regula lui cu siguranta vom depune contestatie si vom fi reprezentati de un avocat competent in acest litigiu vom epuiza toate caile legale e prea devreme sa ma pronunt acum daca vom ajunge si la uefa sper sa nu fie cazul arbitrul este suveran tot ce decide el nu se mai poate intoarce este exact ca in cazul bricheta
7509933 echipa farul s a prezentat la joc pregatita de meci facandu si un program foarte minutios a fost o distanta foarte mare si s a plecat cu doua zile inainte ca sa o parcurgem in doua etape prin reprezentantii sai legali farul nu a putut sa influenteze in niciun fel decizia oficialilor partidei care n au facut nimic altceva decat sa aplice regulamentul de ordine interioara dupa ce arbitrul a anuntat incheierea partidei dupa cele 30 de minute regulamentare echipa noastra s a retras la vestiare cu echipa gazda si cu oficialii jocului farul nu s a dezechipat pana cand raportul de joc nu a fost completat de catre arbitri
7509934 in cazuri din acestea singurul care decide e arbitrul si peste decizia lui nu se trece iasiul a facut o contestatie care va fi judecata probabil in urmatoarele zile eu cred ca aceasta comisie nu va judeca decizia arbitrului care este conforma cu roaf ci va vedea situatia in sine in sensul ca va constata ca organizatorii partidei nu s au asigurat pentru a preintampina evenimente neprevazute in sensul acesta reamintesc ca ar fi trebuit sa existe grupuri electrogene acele generatoare de rezerva obligatorii pentru desfasurarea unei partide in nocturna lucru care nici macar nu s a incercat pentru ca presupun ca nu erau daca ar fi fost incercau sa le porneasca ce facem acuma vrem sa musamalizam o greseala atat de grava acum gasim fiecare fel de fel de scuze e o problema organizatorica grava si fiecare trebuie sa suporte consecintele acum nu vreau sa fiu rau dar oficialii iasiului cred ca au pierdut mult timp ca sa faca niste declaratii inainte de meci in loc loc sa organizeze bine partida
7509935 in fiecare saptamana dinaintea meciurilor dimineata este verificata nocturna este stinsa si intra generatoarele in functiune spun acest lucru in cunostinta de cauza am avut si alte functii in acest club si m am ocupat personal chiar la meciul romania olanda de verificarea instalatiei de nocturna nu poti sa stai si sa spargi seminte cand urmeaza o partida oficiala e o raspundere fantastica
