5680218 antes de que surgiera el videodanza la obra coreogr fica pose a lo que walter benjam n llamara
5680219 video como registro de una obra coreogr fica el videodanza no es un sumar de estrategias provenientes de la danza y del cine sino un espacio abierto a la exploraci n de los medios el cuerpo en movimiento y la imagen digital en funci n de un lenguaje aut nomo
5680220 qu otra cosa podr a ser la videodanza sino un encuentro casual producto del curioso v nculo entre uno de los medios de expresi n m s antiguos del hombre y uno de los m s contempor neos insospechado resultado de la puesta en com n de un medio encarnado en la materialidad del cuerpo con un medio descorporeizado abstracto casi inhumano
5680221 un cuerpo que exige ser tratado de otra forma por que el core grafo ya no debe dise ar s lo su movimiento tambi n debe dise ar la mirada que lo recorrer
5680222 esta coreograf a de la mirada es tal vez lo que mejor define a la videodanza lo que le da su fuerza est tica y lo que justifica su raz n de ser dentro del arte contempor neo
5680223 la pantalla como espacio coreogr fico es un lugar de exploraci n de la danza como sujeto objeto y met fora un lugar de encuentro para ideas de tiempo espacio y movimiento ni la danza ni los medios para manifestarla est n al servicio uno de otro sino que son compa eros o colaboradores en la creaci n de una forma h brida
5680224 si bien hay distintas obras que han podido ejercer una cierta influencia en la interface danza video

5680227 se hace dif cil una reconstrucci n hist rica del videodanza en chile porque si bien existen escasos antecedentes sucede que creaciones que han sido pensadas originalmente como obras esc nicas para espacios tradicionales o p blicos hoy se presentan como videodanza por el hecho de tener un registro editado

5680264 do not judge others and you will not be judged for you will be treated as you treat others the standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged mt 7 1 2
5680265 if you criticize and judge each other then you are criticizing and judging gods law but your job is to obey the law not to judge whether it applies to you god alone who gave the law is the judge
5680266 yes indeed it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the scriptures
5680267 dear brothers and sisters if another believer is overcome by some sin you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path and be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself share each others burdens and in this way obey it is actually the fulfillment of the law of moses ord your god with all your heart all your soul and all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment a second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself the entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments
5680268 so whatever you say or whatever you do remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free there will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others but if you have been merciful god will be merciful when he judges you
5680269 god blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him for the kingdom of heaven is theirs god blesses those who mourn for they will be comforted god blesses those who are humble for they will inherit the whole earth god blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice for they will be satisfied god blesses those who are merciful for they will be shown mercy god blesses those whose hearts are pure for they will see god god blesses those who work for peace for they will be called the children of god

5680281 i believe that there is a heaven and that there is a hell i believe that i am sinful i believe that i might go to hell when i die if jesus is willing to forgive me of my sins and let me go to heaven when i die sure i believe
5680282 believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved
5680283 you say you have faith for you believe that there is one god good for you even the demons believe this and they tremble in terror
5680284 how can you show me your faith if you dont have good deeds i will show you my faith by my good deeds

5680305 we will travel with mwau i dont believe the organisers of the trip would take us abroad and tell us to forget about our parents that to me does not sound like the true agenda
5680306 he should call a meeting to explain his feelings about the proposed trip
5680307 since independence ukambani has had the misfortune of being divided into camps it has always been that any good idea from camp a would always be shot down by those in camp b we dont want these outdated politics to permanently destroy us
5680308 a good parent does not deny a child over 18 the freedom to go to discos the parent simply advises the child not to be associated with the bad things likely to be found there
5680309 since independence ukambani has seen multi million projects started but with little gains for the simple reason that such projects are left to experts who come and go with the initiatives the trip is bound to make the grassroots leaders feel part and parcel of such initiatives
5680310 kilome is still a very poor constituency and i dont understand how our mp is planning to spend more than sh200 million just to take some leaders abroad whats the point of doing so when my people are sleeping hungry
5680311 i will only travel if the organisers use the same amount of money intended for the trip in my constituency to save my people from hunger
5680312 theres always going to be nay sayers people that are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
5680313 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats gonna mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships

5680321 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
5680322 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
5680323 it uses the word bomb in an airport so its not real appropriate
5680324 its probably a little unsettling to people to see that in an airport environment particularly post 9 11
5680325 i just took a look and i can see how this would be offensive scary to some the concept of our city in the crosshairs of a nuclear bomb and the strong anti mccain message can we remove it

5680359 the tables now they seem so small but when i was a kid they seemed so big
5680360 this is what we used to do for entertainment tvs only came out in later years and a lot of people in the village never had them most of us couldnt afford to go out and buy books so we came here a lot
5680361 just before i went to bible college i came in and got a book it was the life and times of d l moody i wanted to read up on that where i was going into the ministry

5680371 in a nutshell the balance of power either bullish or bearish remains fragile
5680372 the volatility of equity markets in the past week is a reminder of the conflicting balance of issues weighing on the market from weak housing tightness in credit availability slowing euro zone and emerging markets that is offset by weakening oil strengthening dollar steepening yield curve and hoarding of cash from corporates

5680386 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5680387 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that

5680411 theres been a small number of truly appalling situations but in the most part people dont hate disabled people
5680412 disabled people are often the victims we are vulnerable and perhaps remind people of their own inadequacies it makes them feel better to put us down
5680413 christine might as well have had a target on her head saying attack me victimise me
5680414 when she was challenged she wouldnt walk away they would think she was probably comical because she would stamp her feet shout back at them pull a funny face and burst into tears
5680415 i think for the vast majority of disabled people bullying is the problem its things like folks with learning difficulties being harassed on the housing estate where they live or children in school being picked on
5680416 in some very rare cases this low level bullying and harassment turns into fully fledged hate crime
5680417 out of forty people in the room i saw probably two thirds of them nod even i was shocked by that and ive worked on disability hate crime
5680418 if you look at the whole experience of hate crime and at the extreme end of that of murder it starts with calling someone a name because they are different
5680419 its a hatred or a fear of difference while some of the small incidents in themselves dont amount to much the cumulative effect on disabled people is enormous

5680494 ainda n o fiz exatamente a avalia o mas posso adiantar que o resultado foi muito bom para o palmeiras e os investidores em um ano vendemos tr s jogadores por import ncias grandes que s o o michael o diego cavalieri e o vald via s o vald via deu quase 100 de lucro que ser dividido proporcionalmente aos investimentos
5680495 claro que esse problema influi para os investimentos nele mas ele tem um valor pequeno na cesta nada relevante vamos dar uma solu o foi descoberto que ele gato mas isso n o quer dizer que ele n o pode ser negociado

5680517 most inertial motion sensors available today offer a low level of integration and require a high degree of factory calibration
5680518 the adis16365 comes fully calibrated and compensated for temperature voltage and other sensitivities this means customers receive meaningful data from the device immediately without requiring additional motion testing or system integration with its improved stability and feature rich interface the adis16365 significantly reduces the cost time and risk of implementation for our customers the new imu fills the considerable void between large expensive imus and less integrated sensors that leave much of the design testing and cost burden to the customer

5680528 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5680529 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5680530 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5680531 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5680532 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5680533 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words

5680543 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5680544 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have

5680555 data conversion technology determines the quality of the user experience in applications as diverse as ultrasound imaging to digital tv mobile phones and other consumer goods
5680556 because there is such a variety of end uses however there is no single specification that defines a good data converter oems today need semiconductor design partners to solve tough signal processing challenges and adi engineers are among the best at bridging the analog and digital worlds through delivering the right converter for the problem
5680557 monitoring the optimal temperature and humidity in controlled storage areas is crucial to ensuring optimum product quality and if this environment is not sufficiently maintained the stored products can quickly become compromised
5680558 the temperature and humidity sensor delivers highly accurate results that are simply transmitted using the communications integrity ensured surecross wireless network and users can select the power method that works best for their individual applications
5680559 with this arrangement if temperature or humidity exceed acceptable limits a remotely located gateway can issue an alarm to management personnel minimizing the risk of product damage or loss

5680941 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement

5681295 israel wants to give the appearance that abbas has achieved something in the peace negotiations but this is convincing no one
5681296 we praise the release of any prisoner but we would like to see prisoners belonging to all of the organizations freed as we plan on doing in the framework of the prisoner exchange deal with israel
5681297 the prisoners release is a victory for the palestinian people
5681298 i am in favor of gestures and the release of even more prisoners but only after gilad is freed
5681299 similar gestures have not resulted in any progress in the past
5681300 i dont know what hamas makes of this but past experience has shown us that such gestures have not advanced gilads release
5681301 this is a gesture and a trust building move aimed at bolstering the moderates in the palestinian authority and the peace process
5681302 this is a gesture for abu mazen abbas ahead of the holiday of ramadan
5681303 when israel releases prisoners only for those who use force it conveys a message that it gives in to pressure and that using force and kidnapping are the only ways to acts against it this is a message which conveys weakness those who only release hamas prisoners bolster hamas
5681304 releasing hundreds of murderers as virtual gestures to the palestinians will only move kidnapped soldier gilad shalits release further away
5681305 the gestures have become one sided and unidirectional and are all done by israel after it has become clear that they are inefficient the government must not be seen as groveling this fails to serve israel and only harms us any move humiliating israel in the eyes of the palestinian moves shalits release further away
5681306 not one of those released is on the lists of prisoners demanded by hamas in return for gilad shalit none of them will be included in future lists as well

5681311 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
5681312 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
5681313 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
5681314 what pretense to assert as did kenneth griffin recipient last year of more than 1 billion in compensation as manager of that the current income distribution has to stand if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard right far better to admit as has wealthiest americans average nearly 15 while those of their salaried and therefore less incentivized assistants just outside their offices are nearly twice that
5681315 so the major themes of these two plans are in the case of senator mccains plan that the major emphasis is on marginal tax rates improves economic incentives
5681316 in the case of obamas plan the goal is primarily to improve progressivity to lower tax burdens on low income people and raise them on higher income people

5681753 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5681754 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5681755 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5681756 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
5681757 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5681758 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5681759 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5681760 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5681761 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5681762 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5681763 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5681764 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5681765 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5681766 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5681767 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5681768 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5681769 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5681770 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5681771 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5681772 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5681773 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5681774 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5681775 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5681776 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5681777 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5681778 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5681779 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5681780 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5681781 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5681782 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5681783 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5681784 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5681785 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5681786 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5681787 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5681788 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5681789 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5681790 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5681791 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5681792 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5681793 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5681794 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5681795 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5681796 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5681797 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5681798 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5681799 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5681800 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5681801 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5681802 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5681803 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5681804 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5681821 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5681822 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5681823 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5681824 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5681825 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5681826 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5681827 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5681828 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5681829 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5681830 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services

5681835 public discussion of global warming is befogged by contrarians whose opinions are given a megaphone by special interests that benefit by keeping the public confused some of the contrarians were once scientists but now they behave at least on the topic of global warming as lawyers defending a client their aim is to present a case as effectively as possible citing only evidence that supports their client and making the story appear as favorable as possible to their client the best the most articulate are sought out by special interests and even by much of the media because the media likes to have balance in its coverage of most topics and especially this topic because special interests have influence on the media
5681836 the claimed threat rests on two key propositions deriving from united nations reports that global temperatures are determined mainly by carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and that human activity especially the use of fossil fuels is increasing these to historically high and dangerous levels but as research continues and understanding grows things look less straightforward and less dire existing doubts about a simple link between temperature and carbon dioxide were reinforced by a paper given at bayreuth university last month this reported that during at least three substantial periods in the last 200 years carbon dioxide levels have equalled or exceeded those prevailing today although temperatures were lower on the second point subsequent studies indicate that the united nations report substantially underestimated natural contributions to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consequently exaggerating those attributable to human activity a report that the contribution from human activity is much less than the un suggested has been endorsed by 31 000 scientists many more than advised the un
5681837 existing doubts about a simple link between temperature and carbon dioxide were reinforced by a paper given at bayreuth university last month this reported that during at least three substantial periods in the last 200 years carbon dioxide levels have equalled or exceeded those prevailing today although temperatures were lower
5681838 on the second point subsequent studies indicate that the united nations report substantially underestimated natural contributions to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consequently exaggerating those attributable to human activity a report that the contribution from human activity is much less than the un suggested has been endorsed by 31 000 scientists many more than advised the un

5681936 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income

5681938 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5681939 there were arguments about picking other technologies such as streaming video or whatever but we picked hdtv because it is in so many homes now and is really impacting the way people are watching television which is still the most dominant medium
5681940 about a third of people who get hdtv says they go straight to the hd section of their programming guides
5681941 channels that dont have hd are at a bit of a detriment because theyre not the first choice
5681942 its pretty hard to buy a new tv set and find one that is not hd capable
5681943 im hearing that the olympics are up 25 in homes with hdtvs

5681966 det handler i f rste omgang om at f dem til at acceptere at de har en seksualitet som ikke kan udleves og s handler det om at hj lpe dem til at leve med den seksualitet

5681970 demonstrated the resilience determination and strength of the jamaican spirit
5681971 this matter does not qualify under standing order 12 but would have qualified under standing order 11
5681972 it lacks sense logic and all that seems right tt claims to be a democracy let transparency prevail is it putting the cart before the horse this is a country full of talkers
5681973 in this instance the national youth assembly will empower and strengthen young people the opposition is half awake and half asleep the bill cries out to all children
5681974 we have come here to serve the people this bill is not a great idea we should form a domestic violence centre
5681975 the government is quite competent to deal with these matters we are not about putting band aids on any situation
5681976 the most atrocious piece of legislation i have ever seen
5681977 grades one to five are considered at cape to be acceptable grades
5681978 trinidad and tobago continues to lead the region in terms of its performance at cape
5681979 ninety four percent obtained acceptable grades as compared to 93 percent last year the good news is that there was a one percent improvement and considering the numbers involved you would appreciate that it took some effort to get there this is compared to the rest of region where 89 percent achieved grades one to five this year
5681980 however law continues to be a challenge we see a decrease in performance from last year of 15 6 percent with 66 2 percent achieving acceptable grades geometrical and mechanical engineering drawing have decreased 7 5 percent with 71 percent of 76 students attaining acceptable grades while in history a decline of 5 8 was registered with 86 9 percent of 435 entries attaining acceptable grades
5681981 tt is a significant partner of cxc as 32 percent of all acceptable grades come from this country
5681982 i have noted a steady growth in grade one offered across the various subjects with a ten percent increase and a six percent increase in grade twos awarded this year all of this adds up to tts maintenance of a leading position in the examination throughout the region
5681983 this will be in effect from 2008 in the areas of languages with an additional six scholarships mathematics six visual and performing arts four science four and technical studies four
5681984 everything is fine the players werent affected in any way we did experience some rain and strong winds but overall conditions are good at this time
5681985 the players were never in any danger their morale is high and they are looking forward to a great game
5681986 we at the maha sabha are investors in the hcu as such we want to know what were the practices of the hcu management and why loans like this one were granted
5681987 it would be convenient to say that its a whole lot of other people who need to be part of the equation but we have the job and we have to do something
5681988 so now can i solve all those problems tomorrow afternoon can i even get the attention of the people who have control over those things right now in new orleans after katrina the answer is no i cant but i cant take the position that i cant succeed unless i have those things i have to take the position that were going to do it in spite of that now will it be hard will i be less successful probably yes but i have to take that approach because i dont have really any other cards to play
5681989 if we had tried to do this on the fly my concern was that it could turn into some very messy public event
5681990 the conservatives tried to preempt gordon browns autumn offensive with the launch yesterday of a 19 page paper called an unfair britain in which they attempt to show that labour policies have made britain more unfair
5681991 here in the heart of mexicos tequila country where every town has a distillery and the air smells sweet like fermenting molasses a sign proudly marks the entrance to miguel ram rezs farm
5681992 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
5681993 i am not and never have been a man of the right my position was on the left and is now in the centre of politics
5681994 be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou die before thy time
5681995 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
5681996 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated
5681997 remind me never to get this guy mad at me

5682002 i think im going to have to kill your rooster
5682003 i do believe i would cook that rooster if he were mine
5682004 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5682005 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5682006 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5682007 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5682008 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5682009 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut
5682010 my determination remains intact france is resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty the cause is just it is the honor of france and its armies to defend it
5682011 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5682012 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
5682013 the problems and challenges the country faces are enormous and they cannot afford to lose any further time
5682014 yesterday they fired gun shots in the air to celebrate musharrafs resignation that seems crazy to me
5682015 people do not realize that they rulers have no spirit to serve the people
5682016 at the end of the day they stuff their foreign bank accounts with all the looted money they earn while in power
5682017 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5682018 i wish i could smile when im nervous i cant even talk
5682019 i think they are going to be the olympic champions for sure
5682020 i think nobody is going to beat them we are happy to go for the bronze
5682021 i told them im going to see you up on the podium and well be sitting side by side again
5682022 but im not playing ive got to be the nice guy
5682023 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5682024 the eu has a lot of leverage against russia and unless it shows some resolve it gives the russians the bargaining power
5682025 if the west doesnt stick up for georgia it sends the signal that countries will pay a price with russia for strong ties to europe
5682026 obviously the russians acted disproportionately but what saakashvili did was not right and we cant talk about him being the only victim here
5682027 if all condi wants to do at nato is talk about being hard on russia she is going to have a bad day
5682028 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5682029 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5682030 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5682031 in this market unless i have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk im not going to take a flyer on it even with heath ledger
5682032 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavour for spammers
5682033 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5682034 he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5682035 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio
5682036 kara did exactly what she said she was going to do and needed to do
5682037 she hung in there in the fastest of the two heats and ran fast enough to get to the finals
5682038 cine sunt suporterii stelei sa injure pe cine vor ei mi am pus deja o gheata in cui iar daca mai continui sa joc asa o pun si pe a doua
5682039 we are not in the position to speculate on the outcome of the investigation but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness
5682040 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
5682041 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5682042 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
5682043 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
5682044 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5682045 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
5682046 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
5682047 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
5682048 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
5682049 but the teeth the law has got is the option of a yellow or red card to sanction people that wont comply you go from a penalty to a yellow card to make sure the laws work otherwise teams will keep doing this all day
5682050 say couldnt you tell us where there is a nice picnic place near here
5682051 yeh a few miles furder on youll find a nice little brook in a grove of sugar maples with green grass on all sides
5682052 i will give my maximum for my second home race
5682053 im really determined to have a great end to the season
5682054 the result in hungary gives me confidence for the rest of the season
5682055 war in georgia is bigger news than the campaign august 11 17 2008
5682056 olympics draw high percentage of women viewers and ads intended for them
5682057 javascript 2 but it never really stuck not a name that describes any ratified standard or current proposal
5682058 no me interesa un vicepresidente para mandar a los funerales

5682060 soy consciente de la importancia de esta cuesti n dada mi edad
5682061 it didnt have anything to do at all with my aunt
5682062 we get along fine talk on the phone from time to time but shes just a normal aunt for me
5682063 we dont have these close ties people think we do its not like we analyze training data or race results together a lot of people assume that we discuss tactics and stuff its so untrue
5682064 obviously if i ever had any questions i could always ask her or my parents or other team mates whove been to the olympics before
5682065 she said it isnt any fun parents dont want their children to do the same sports because of some unpleasant memories swimming is a tough business she said i should try something else
5682066 so one day my brother and i went along to a kayak club for children our parents urged us to give it a try it might be something wed enjoy
5682067 it was great from day one as kids wed hang out together do stuff go camping and go to races
5682068 if my name were mueller or hintze no one would care about me
5682069 so if it brings a little attention to our sport thats fine the family story is unfortunately interesting to people but im doing my own thing here
5682070 ped s y no recib s porque ped s mal
5682071 and internet security experts believe that it could be just as devastating to the u s s economy and infrastructure as a deadly bombing
5682072 hackers mounted coordinated assaults on georgian government media banking and transportation sites in the weeks before russian troops invaded
5682073 the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5682074 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5682075 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites
5682076 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5682077 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5682078 the reason is that they broadcast disinformation during the war that affects our population badly and puts people under stress
5682079 i would not call it media what they broadcast and print is just propaganda and we dont want to scare our population with this disinformation
5682080 when we let them broadcast again we dont know lets see
5682081 we should pay special attention to the anti terrorist protection of key infrastructure sites
5682082 the russians are looking for a pretext to extend the occupation both in time and space
5682083 we have received an official note from georgia that they are leaving
5682084 the cis is a voluntary body and each country decides itself whether to remain in the commonwealth or not
5682085 get thee gone coward go fare as fares the poor beggar thou soughtst to bite
5682086 yon beast sought to bite an old beggar as we came through the park so i whipped him but for naught save cruelty or disobedience will i ever whip a dog so butter the next time that thou seest me about to lash one keep thy counsel
5682087 i am a weary fling me some skins on the settle and i will lie down and thou shalt card out my locks with thy fingers
5682088 im personally going to be reducing some grants and doing away with some
5682089 were asking all the house members to do the same
5682090 its not a lot of money but the main thing were trying to do is let everyone know how important this is its the right message to send
5682091 if we are not careful we will exhaust our local resource
5682092 in view of the fatal incidents i have ordered the dole regional offices to be more vigorous in the conduct of routine inspection and in efforts to require establishments to comply with health and safety standards and other labor laws
5682093 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5682094 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5682095 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5682096 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5682097 we call on russia to demonstrate both in word and deed its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5682098 the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire
5682099 while we view lehman as well managed and nimble deteriorating fixed income asset valuations and leveraged loans have led to downward earnings revisions
5682100 we dont think the investors and rating agencies would welcome this divestiture which brings a steady cash flow diversification and a lower compensation ratio

5682187 muslims demand for disbandment of the deviant ahmadiyah sect is not a violation of religion freedom because ahmadiyah has defiled islamic teachings by recognizing mirza ghulan ahmad as the last prophet instead of the prophet muhammad
5682188 if ahmadiyah disobeys the decree or continues its deviant activities we will report it to the authorities and recommend that the president disband ahmadiyah
5682189 it is halal to spill the blood of ahmadiyah if any of you should kill ahmadiyah as ordered by us i personally as well as the fpi will take responsibility
5682190 if we find any israelis we will first try to persuade them to leave but if they refuse we will slaughter them
5682191 if within a week they are still active and sell the magazine we will take physical action
5682192 even if it had no pictures of women in it we would still protest it because of the name our crew will clearly hound the editors
5682193 if they support the cartoons we will have no other choice but to ask them to leave indonesia
5682194 there is powder and lipstick in your bag that means youre lying to say that you are a housewife you are guilty you are prostitute
5682195 she could not prove she is not a prostitute it is true when my men arrested her she was not committing adultery but why does she put on such make up
5682196 now the sectarian groups are pressing their agenda to change indonesia into a theocratic state they seek to formalize islam as the state ideology
5682197 this is an attempt by some people to import arab culture to indonesia
5682198 i would say this is the beginning of a further war between indonesians who want to maintain a secular state an open democratic society and those who want to dominate and turn the country into a muslim country
5682199 the government has not been able to protect citizens from violence from prosecutions committed by hard line groups this is a serious serious problem in indonesia we have been able to achieve several political reforms political freedom but the case of ahmadiyah undermines the image of reform even more starkly because religious freedom has been attacked after 10 years of reform in indonesia
5682200 the state guarantees all persons the freedom of worship each according to his her own religion or belief
5682201 from today we will no longer talk about reconciliation our focus now must be preparing for war ready your guns spears and daggers
5682202 unlike other groups it is not fighting for an islamic state but it does want to establish strict sharia law
5682203 we call on president susilo bambang yudhoyono to immediately issue a presidential decree disbanding the ahmadiyyah organization confiscate its assets and demand its members and followers to disband and return to the true teachings of islam
5682204 if they refuse to do so they should return to islam by renouncing their beliefs
5682205 its ridiculous to suggest that we form a new religion we are muslims who pray five times a day fast during ramadan and believe in the same quran
5682206 i have ordered all members of the islamic force to prepare for war against the ahmadiyah sect and their supporters we will never accept the arrest of a single member of our force before the government disbands ahmadiyah we will fight until our last drop of blood
5682207 we will not accept islam to be defiled by anyone i prefer to be in prison or even be killed than accepting islam to be defiled
5682208 ostend has hired the former security expert of the former prime minister verhofstadt
5682209 every headline mentions measures taken but theyve done nothing its just linguistics
5682210 you call that a measure the dude isnt even in ostend yet
5682211 realised we were americans and then started ranting at us about george bush and american foreign policy he said we were in a muslim area and were not allowed to spread our christian message he said he was going to take us to the police station
5682212 i told him that this had nothing to do with the gospel we were preaching but he became very aggressive he said we were in a muslim area and were not allowed to spread our christian message he said we were committing a hate crime by telling the youths to leave islam and said that he was going to take us to the police station
5682213 he told us we were trying to convert muslims to christianity and that that was a hate crime he was very intimidating and it concerns me that somebody holding his views can become a police officer albeit at pcso level
5682214 i couldnt believe this was happening in britain the bishop of rochester was criticised by the church of england recently when he said there were no go areas in britain but he was right there are certainly no go areas for christians who want to share the gospel
5682215 you have been warned if you come back here and get beaten up well you have been warned
5682216 when the bishop of rochester recently warned that britain was developing muslim no go areas he was denounced the length and breadth of the establishment with government ministers and bishops falling over each other to declare that they did not recognise the country he was describing
5682217 naeem is a community man that is why he joined the police
5682218 the investigation concluded that the pcso acted with the best of intentions when he intervened to diffuse a heated argument between two groups of men

5682229 the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave
5682230 surveys show muslims have the highest rate of unemployment the poorest health the most disability and fewest educational qualifications of any faith group in the country this means they are vulnerable rendering them open to ignorant and hostile commentary from mainstream figures
5682231 we should all feel ashamed about the way we treat muslims in the media in our politics and on our streets we do not treat muslims with the tolerance decency and fairness that we often like to boast is the british way we urgently need to change our public culture
5682232 there is no social political or cultural protection for muslims as far as the british political media and literary establishment is concerned the normal rules of engagement are suspended
5682233 i think most people would agree that if you ask muslims today what do they feel like they feel like the jews of europe i dont mean to equate that with the holocaust but in the way that it was legitimate almost and still is in some parts to target jews many muslims would say that we feel the exact same way somehow theres a message out there that its ok to target people as long as its muslims and you dont have to worry about the facts and people will turn a blind eye
5682234 icm survey found that 51 per cent of britons blame islam to some degree for the 2005 attacks
5682235 our so called scholars today are content with their toyotas and semi detached houses
5682236 openly declared war on islam and the foreigners in the crusade against the muslims we love death the way you love life
5682237 we will not stand for our country and people being terrorised nor will we stand for our government terrorising any other peoples
5682238 it is our view that current british government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in the uk and abroad
5682239 hitler was a product of german society where anti semitic attitudes had existed unchecked for decades we have got to listen and learn from what happened there and be vigilant i am not talking about large numbers of people being rounded up but we could be looking at situations where muslims are routinely assaulted in the streets
5682240 allahs messenger may peace be upon him ordered to kill dogs and he sent men to the corners of medina that they should be killed
5682241 my concern was that its not welcomed by all communities
5682242 since then the police have explained that it was an oversight on their part and that if they had seen it was going to cause upset they would not have done it
5682243 did not seek advice from the forces diversity adviser prior to publishing and distributing the postcards that was an oversight and we apologise for any offence caused
5682244 we are obviously aware of and sensitive to cultural sensitivities btp officers do have the power to stop and search anyone under section 44 of the terrorism act this also covers the use of dog handlers and dogs which are used to indicate any substance they have been trained to detect
5682245 we are trying to ensure that police forces are aware of sensitivities that people can have with the dogs to make sure they are not going against any religious or cultural element within people s homes it is being addressed and forces are working towards doing it
5682246 there is no reason why sharia principles or any other religious code should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution
5682247 it is possible in this country for those who are entering into a contractual agreement to agree that the agreement shall be governed by law other than english law
5682248 sharia also traditionally insists on a second class status of citizenship for jews and christians all four main schools of sharia say that the penalty for apostasy abandoning the faith is death
5682249 in jihad a man takes away life and gives it away solely in the cause of allah
5682250 if you are a black vegetarian muslim asylum seeking one legged lesbian lorry driver i want the same rights as you
5682251 the teacher then asked the class if someone had any water to wash their feet in essence my child was being forced to behave like a muslim and pray to allah
5682252 this isnt right its taking things too far i understand that they have to learn about other religions i can live with that but it is taking it a step too far to be punished because they wouldnt join in muslim prayer making them pray to allah who isnt who they worship is wrong and what got me is that they were told they were being disrespectful
5682253 its absolutely disgusting theres no other way of putting it but if muslims were asked to go to church on sunday and take holy communion there would be war
5682254 somehow theres a message out there that its ok to target people as long as its muslims
5682255 not a single person accused of an anti semitic crime had been prosecuted on a charge of religiously aggravated offending

5682313 the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5682314 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5682315 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5682316 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5682325 il pericolo di contaminazioni tossiche da diossina derivante dallincendio dei boschi esiste e si puo arrivare alle percentuali di immissione altissime da me denunciate se assieme ai boschi bruciano discariche piu o meno abusive come e accaduto
5682326 recenti ricerche condotte da studiosi come brian k gullett e abderrahmane touati spiega loiero in una nota del portavoce mettono in evidenza la produzione di diossine negli incendi dei boschi secondo lepa lagenzia per la protezione dellambiente americana nel 2004 tali incendi sarebbero stati responsabili della immissione nellambiente del 54 delle diossine negli stati uniti la stessa agenzia ha messo in evidenza che i pericoli per la salute della diossina sono piu importanti di quel che si pensasse
5682327 e del tutto evidente che sulla base di queste informazioni in generale gli incendi boschivi con particolare riguardo poi a quelli di rifiuti e discariche anche nella nostra calabria debbano essere evitati come precauzione questo e il senso del mio allarme in seguito ai numerosi e devastanti incendi dei giorni scorsi con conseguente invito ai cittadini di denunciare i piromani che attentano al nostro patrimonio naturale e alla nostra stessa salute
5682328 non sono io a sostenerlo afferma lo dicono studiosi di fama internazionale cito per tutti il professor silvano focardi rettore delluniversita di siena uno dei massimi esperti al mondo di ecotossicologia minimizzare quindi e un rischio aggiuntivo che si corre bisogna prenderne invece coscienza e prevenire perche abbiamo visto che su 350 roghi in calabria molti si sono verificati in zone che nascondevano discariche abusive basta guardare a pizzo dove lincendio si e prodotto in una discarica di copertoni con colonne di fumo nero tutta diossina finita nellaria
5682329 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade

5682340 i have always believed that india and china have unique and complementary strengths which when pooled together can take on the world we already have a successful joint venture with jiangling tractor company the jv between m amp m and yancheng tractor will further combine indian entrepreneurial and managerial skills with chinese competitiveness and efficiency i am sure this formidable combination will contribute substantially towards realising our ambition to be the leading tractor manufacturer in the global market
5682341 we are delighted to partner with mahindra and look forward to a successful joint venture the jv stands to gain by the operational excellence international sales and distribution network and r amp d capabilities of mahindra and will eventually lead to the creation of chinas leading tractor company
5682342 the formation of this joint venture with yancheng tractor company is a significant step in our plans for the china market the huanghai jinma brand is extremely strong in the domestic china market and the company is also one of the biggest exporters of tractors along with our current operation at nanchang we will have a much larger scale on which we plan to build up our business in china
5682343 we will have a product range going up to 125hp we will also have a large manufacturing base which will be used to not only produce for the domestic market but also for low cost manufacture for exports the combined distribution network of both our operations will give us a much larger presence in the market overall this is an extremely important development for our overseas tractor business operations

5682351 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5682352 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5682353 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5682354 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5682355 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5682356 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5682357 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5682358 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5682359 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5682360 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5682361 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5682362 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5682363 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5682364 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5682365 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them

5682467 we have a clear focus about what we want to do with the project and that definitely helped us in our bid to secure this funding

5682469 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
5682470 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
5682471 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced
5682472 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
5682473 there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
5682474 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the re election of members of congress

5682479 today for the first time in almost 50 years the united states stands on the verge of attaining nuclear primacy
5682480 it will probably soon be possible for the united states to destroy the long range nuclear arsenals of russia or china with a first strike
5682481 hawks who believe that the united states is a benevolent force in the world will welcome the new nuclear era because they trust that us dominance in both conventional and nuclear weapons will help deter aggression by other countries
5682482 but doves who oppose using nuclear threats to coerce other states and fear an emboldened and unconstrained united states will worry nuclear primacy might lure washington into more aggressive behavior they argue especially when combined with us dominance in so many other dimensions of national power

5682490 disturbing facts and figures that illustrate the consequences of having no access to sanitation
5682491 but it is worth noting that very many people are still not familiar with the statistics or even aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
5682492 these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life
5682493 the year is not over yet but i would like to take a look at what the iys has achieved so far
5682494 if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
5682495 when i visited ethiopia earlier this year i learned that 1 3 million latrines had been built within 18 months in the countrys southern nations province
5682496 unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet and ladies and gentlemen i hope i can inspire you to do the same
5682497 is the iys 2008 making enough impact on the ground will our activities lead to sustainable improvements
5682498 in other words how many more people are gaining access to improved sanitation facilities how many have already paid a visit to the toilet how many now experience improved sanitation as a basic facility
5682499 six months down the line we can conclude without doubt that unsgabs efforts are bearing fruit we are on the right path and support around the world is increasing but that does not mean we have achieved all our goals in fact we have only just begun

5682531 were sitting here talking about why a guy didnt run out a ball thats crazy
5682532 the only reason im talking about it is that my hearts a little jacked up with that it bothered me weve got something really special here the most amazing thing for this team in a long long time and we dont need to be talking about this stuff

5682538 we want the kids to understand that taiko is more than just music
5682539 they learned the proper stance and posture as well as the purpose of drumming taiko represents the three treasures of buddhism the drum itself represents the calling voice of the buddha the drumsticks bachi represent the teachings or dharma and the prayers before and after each piece as well as the listeners represent the community or sangha
5682540 i wanted to start when i was about 8 years old but i had to wait until my parents thought i was ready it was almost like coming of age then we all had to learn to work together
5682541 once you have it we will put it all together
5682542 this instrument is significant in buddhism because of its construction
5682543 it has 108 pieces which represent the 108 desires in human nature our meditation beads also have 108 pieces
5682544 all of what we do helps us to be more mindful of the people around us
5682545 were all mindful of what were doing because we know that our actions will affect future generations
5682546 we have seen many pictures and stories about the tibetan buddhist monks over the years we have read about buddhist monks fleeing from tibet to india to escape the chinese cruelty and so now to finally be able to spend a whole week with our visiting tibetan monks is a lifetime experience i am tremendously impressed with their courage and their dedication to human rights and religious freedom
5682547 im very grateful and excited for our community im really just thrilled
5682548 it felt very natural though it happened very quickly there is so much interest and people are coming forward its not people saying i want to become a buddhist but i think they are coming because they are recognizing the teachings speak to them and offer something they can understand and incorporate in their lives
5682549 we can offer more for people who are interested in pursuing their studies further
5682550 theres a depth here among the people this place is my soul home and to bring the thing that has meant so much in my life to a place that has meant so much in my life is incredibly rewarding
5682551 he gave that teaching from a webcam in los angeles sometimes from the hospital where scrubs is shot or from our living room in l a because they didnt have a center

5682558 i just wanted to put the contract to bed we wanted to get it sorted this year but with new players coming and going there wasnt time i love it here the club want to sign me and there wont be any problems i suggested that i concentrate on my performances this season because its not nice for the fans to have an ongoing thing but i will be a chelsea player for the rest of my career
5682559 it was nice to score the first goal under scolari i was trying to play a bit further up because we have a lot of midfielders who like to play deep we play five in midfield and im the one who likes to run in behind everyone worked for each other and we looked like a cohesive unit
5682560 its a way of life at a big club you come to chelsea and you have to expect competition i thrive on it there are always big name players at this club and i love competing with them and i love learning from then it can only make me a better player
5682561 they must be black all over and must have a reasonable heel

5682591 ante la inmensa cantidad de dinero que se entrega en este subsidio lo menos que podemos pedir es que el estado controle necesitamos saber d nde van los recursos qui n los va a gastar aqu tenemos que preocuparnos del bien com n
5682592 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5682593 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5682594 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5682595 la mamma di lele fa i bucchini con il culo
5682596 queste bastarde e questi bastardi mi stanno ributtando in faccia la disperazione di un tempo non troppo lontano
5682597 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5682598 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5682599 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5682600 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5682601 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5682602 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5682603 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5682604 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5682605 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5682606 i am telling the truth so if you dont believe me or if you bother checking my facts obviously you are against god
5682607 chris henry has forfeited his opportunity to pursue a career with the bengals his conduct can no longer be tolerated
5682608 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career
5682609 but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5682610 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5682611 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
5682612 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it these guys mis stepped they made mistakes and they paid prices for it verging on ruinous but that doesnt mean i dont like them personally i like them as people i regret whats happened to them and i regret theyre no longer here as far as going forward we dont want that kind of behavior
5682613 we have to fix the system or it will be a long time before the economy recovers
5682614 the general public wants some standards that they can respect and be protected by on a national basis
5682615 invariably somebodys ox gets gored but right now we dont have a uniformed standard and thats part of the problem
5682616 sen casey believes that a disturbing byproduct of the increased rates of foreclosure as shown by these ap stories is an increase in the number unscrupulous individuals who corrupt the appraisal process to artificially inflate home prices to increase profits by cheating home buyers
5682617 the users understand the list is built by fellow members and they need to report on their experience with a plumber because if they dont someone else wont report on their roofer and the system falls apart
5682618 i was a little skeptical about joining at first because you have to pay
5682619 but after talking with contractors who asked if ive used angies list i figured if theyre recommending it when they have no control over what homeowners are saying im going to take a look at it
5682620 using angies list i was comfortable about the quality of the work i would get because i read the experience other people in my area had with the contractors before calling
5682621 m me si la vie est courte un sourire ne prend quune seconde
5682622 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and to weaken the georgian state
5682623 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5682624 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5682625 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5682626 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5682627 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5682628 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5682629 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5682630 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5682631 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5682632 el mejor m dico en cirug a est tica del mundo
5682633 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5682634 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5682635 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5682636 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5682637 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5682638 they are very aware of the inequality in the system
5682639 the most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the department of womens affairs it is not just us pushing our ideas on to them
5682640 please please take our words somewhere where people will be kind and help us
5682641 las medidas adecuadas para entre todos salir de la forma menos negativa de la situaci n de crisis econ mica que estamos viviendo
5682642 cuando nos encontramos con una situaci n ca tica en la rioja de la cual salimos de forma boyante transformado la propia regi n
5682643 estamos viviendo una serie de acontecimientos en nuestro pa s que generan una cierta inquietud inseguridad e incertidumbre debido a una crisis de confianza en la econom a espa ola y en el gobierno socialista
5682644 al gobierno de espa a se le ha venido encima el sistema de la crisis econ mica ya que no reconoce de forma clara la situaci n de la crisis y no aborda medidas de cara al futuro
5682645 este situaci n es fruto de las malas cosas hechas atr s como el estatuto de catalu a que provoc un recurso de inconstitucionalidad por parte del gobierno de la rioja
5682646 si zapatero dice que la negociaci n del sistema de financiaci n se va a hacer de forma multilateral tendr que cambiar el estatuto auton mico porque sino una ley org nica se la estar a saltando el propio presidente del gobierno
5682647 es necesario que zapatero explique con claridad si cumple o no esta ley y si se cumple de forma bilateral tendr que cambiar la ley del estatuto de catalu a para que la financiaci n auton mica se negocie de forma multilateral que es lo que parece que quiere todo el mundo y ahora tambi n quiere el propio presidente
5682648 its better to decline and invite than not get one at all
5682649 hechas para la ciudadan a contando con los logro eses y con una inversi n econ mica pensada para generar riqueza para la ciudad
5682650 hechas para la ciudadan a contando con los logro eses y con una inversi n econ mica pensada para generar riqueza para la ciudad con actividades como la fuente del vino o el d a de la vendimia
5682651 ya era hora de que las fiestas de la vendimia gozasen de un d a dedicado a la misma y consideramos un acierto aun mayor que este d a transcurra en el casco antiguo para conseguir que las fiestas no sean meras fiestas sino que tengan el objetivo de recuperar zonas olvidadas por el anterior gobierno del partido popular
5682652 apoyo a la cultura popular a trav s del folclore creemos muy apropiado ayudar a nuestro folclore tan olvidado por el gobierno regional
5682653 en vez de apoyar un estupendo programa festivo est n alarmando a los logro eses con el tema de la nueva ubicaci n de las carpas
5682654 un acierto ya que se instalar n m s carpas ampliando as la zona de ocio
5682655 est rezando para que llueva en san mateo y que todo salga mal
5682656 ya intentaron destrozar el cohete limpio pero finalmente fue un xito de los logro eses y ahora quieren torpedear otras actividades
5682657 no colabore en nada y espere que todo salga mal

5682676 if aaron boone is your cleanup hitter your team has problems
5682677 you murdered my mother and tried to murder my niece you caused this family nothing but pain and devastation
5682678 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5682679 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those
5682680 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5682681 were still working hard to ensure compatibility between the guitar hero and rock band titles currently on the market
5682682 for the past several months we have been working closely with neversoft and activision harmonix and konami to ensure that playstation 3 guitars and drum sets will all feature a basic level of gameplay compatibility
5682683 for the most part this means that the titles with musical peripherals will work with the others software
5682684 during our recent out reach programmes we came across a lot of calls from girls on the need to carry out a comprehensive fc roll out programme since these condoms cannot be easily accessed by the youth
5682685 we need female condoms not that we are promiscuous we just want want to protect ourselves and our government has an obligation to protect us
5682686 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned

5682697 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men who were caught in an extremely violent ambush
5682698 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been dealt a severe blow
5682699 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5682700 this was a calm response peace has been established in the region and it will last
5682701 although saakashvili signed the six principles peace plan we can see that this order is not being implemented
5682702 i wonder if the list of 80 captives had been prepared beforehand to get on our nerves
5682703 arrangements are currently underway to prepare material bases for peacekeeping outposts as an extra security measure under moscow agreements
5682704 we will keep the serviceable weapons and equipment and destroy the rest to prevent them from falling into the hands of those who started this bloody war
5682705 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5682706 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5682707 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5682708 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5682709 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5682710 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5682711 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5682712 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5682713 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5682714 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5682715 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5682716 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5682717 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5682718 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5682719 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5682720 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5682721 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5682722 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5682723 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5682724 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5682725 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5682726 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5682727 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5682728 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5682729 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5682730 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5682731 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5682732 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5682733 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5682734 who are open to doing something on the production side
5682735 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5682736 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5682737 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

5682748 dass sie nicht von oben verordnet sondern in der region geplant und umgesetzt werden das erm glicht zusammenarbeit schafft arbeitspl tze und wertsch pfung in der region und verst rkt innovationen diese regionalen impulse sind eine offensive antwort auf die globalisierung um die zukunftsf higkeit des l ndlichen raumes weiterzuentwickeln
5682749 wir brauchen ein nachhaltiges steuersystem das eine leistungsf hige wirtschaft soziale solidarit t und den schutz der umwelt gew hrleistet dazu kommen wir aber nur mit einem lang fristigen steuerreformprozess der sich von klaren perspektiven leiten l sst und nicht von wahlterminen oder blo er tarifkorrektur
5682750 es muss gelingen das thema steuern parteipolitisch au er streit zu stellen einen prozess zur modernisierung des fiskalsystems ein zuleiten und auch ber jahre durchzuhalten wir brauchen eine kosozialpartnerschaft d h das einbinden aller parteien sozialpartner und der zivilgesellschaft bei der bew ltigung solcher langfristiger herausforderungen skandinavische l nder zeigen vor wie erfolgreich es ist wichtige themen wie die steuerpolitik parteien bergreifend zu behandeln
5682751 wer die steuerdiskussion allein auf die steuerquote reduziert macht es sich zu einfach
5682752 die relation zwischen steuern und leistungen des staates muss stimmen das gesamtpaket ist also ausschlaggebend

5682755 kinder brauchen hunde juniorhandling eine sportart die die pers nlichkeit f rdert
5682756 sch n dass nun auch die vp frauen erkennen dass quoten ein sinnvolles hilfsmittel auf dem weg zur gleichbehandlung sind es handelt sich hier ja um eine langj hrige forderung der sp frauen noch sch ner w re es wenn frau rauch kallat sich dazu durchringen k nnte zu sagen wie hoch die quote ihrer meinung nach sein sollte
5682757 pensionssplitting alleine ist noch keine ma nahme gegen altersarmut da davon in erster linie frauen mit gut verdienenden m nnern profitieren k nnen mein ziel ist die eigenst ndige also partnerunabh ngige alterssicherung f r frauen dazu z hlt es auch qualifizierte erwerbsm glichkeiten zu schaffen damit frauen selbst f r ihre pension vorsorgen k nnen aus frauenpolitischer sicht w re es w nschenswert dass ersatzzeiten und kindererziehungsbedingte teilzeitarbeit in der h he des vorangegangenen einkommens bewertet werden w rden
5682758 bei der frauenquote in aufsichtsr ten handelt es sich offensichtlich um eine alt polit damen versorgungsregelung
5682759 denn wer kommt denn f r solche aufsichtsratst tigkeiten in frage m tter verk uferinnen oder friseurinnen kaum es werden haupts chlich alt und ex politikerinnen mit solchen posten versorgt werden das d rfte das kalk l des quotenfaibles der vp frauen sein
5682760 dass eine derartige politpensionssicherung der wirtschaft und sterreichs frauen und m ttern wenig helfen wird liegt auf der hand die sich einige vp frauen nun mit sicherheit reiben
5682761 abgesehen davon dass es eine kateridee sondergleichen ist privaten unternehmen und ihren aktion ren vorschreiben zu wollen wen sie in den aufsichtsrat setzen d rfen die personifizierte quotenfrau rauch kallat soll dieses irrwitzig realit tsfremde ansinnen einmal ihrem parteifreund josef taus vortragen und sich dessen antwort anh ren
5682762 geht es um die nach wie vor ausst ndige gleichberechtigung und chancengleichheit f r frauen diese existiert nicht aber das wird vom erlauchten kreis der vp frauen schlicht ignoriert
5682763 zum automatisierten pensionssplitting sei darauf verwiesen dass die vp frauen anscheinend auch noch nichts vom bereits bestehenden pensionsanspruch ersatzzeiten f r kindererziehungszeiten geh rt haben
5682764 diese zeiten werden vom vp frauen programm nicht ber cksichtigt weshalb sich der gesamtpensionsanspruch f r die eltern insgesamt reduziert und anrechenbare pensionsanspr che zugunsten der pensionsversicherung auf die familien abgew lzt werden
5682765 wie ich gerade erfahren habe stellt nun auch die vp wien ihre dreieckst nder bereits am 22 august auf das ist h chst bedauerlich offenbar ist diesen beiden parteien die wiener bev lkerung v llig egal hauptsache sie k nnen das sch ne wiener stadtbild so rasch wie m glich zupflastern und verschandeln
5682766 diese bertriebene eile in sachen wahlkampf spricht f r sich die fp hat die kandidatur ihres ehemaligen bervaters haider am falschen fu erwischt und dass die vp angesichts eines charismafreien spitzenkandidaten und der belastenden bilanz ihrer blockadepolitik gegen die menschen hypernerv s ist liegt auf der hand wir werden uns diesem traurigen schauspiel zu lasten der bev lkerung jedenfalls nicht anschlie en die wiener sp wird die zahl der dreieckst nder begrenzen und diese erst am 29 august aufstellen zum wohl der wienerinnen und wiener sowie des stadtbildes

5682773 a few days later i walked through the passage of the garage which normally i could walk with my eyes closed i got trapped down by the tree trunk and broke my ankle

5682776 we will be doing something similar this year and we will be hoping to use the high profile of cycling at the olympics
5682777 clearly the profile of chris hoy has put cycling right to the top of the agenda
5682778 those guys have a lot of talent a lot of depth
5682779 we think theyre like one of the best receiving corps in the league lotta speed lotta quickness they catch the ball well they have an awesome quarterback with a great touch on the football we have our hands full but we had our hands full in week 1 with them they can put a lot of points on the board
5682780 they just have a good team theyve always had a good team even last year those guys are playing good football right now so like i said we just have to keep playing our game and play four quarters we need to give ricky ray some different looks so far weve played good football on defense but i think we can be damn good so you havent seen our best so far
5682781 competing at that level through their training camp was a benefit to him
5682782 really as much as anything he was sent back to us not released he still has another year left and this is really the place he should be running plays running an offense thats been a real benefit to him and our program as a whole
5682783 we like to think of ourselves as the next best team from last year
5682784 we had our chances against manitoba but didnt get it done against them and they ended up being the vanier cup champions we were a good team last year and we think we are as good or better this year we worked hard all winter as coaches recruiting and players preparing so were ready to get into a game
5682785 it doesnt evoke thoughts of rinks when you step outside but training camps right around the corner
5682786 were all excited the kids got back monday afternoon and we have fitness testing on tuesday thursday theyre on the ice
5682787 were going to do things a little different this year weve done away with rookie camp and were going to mix up our vets and rookies in the mornings for practices at night well have the rookies scrimmage against each other and the vets too but we just thought it was a good idea to have a good influence on some of our younger players and have a bit of mentorship
5682788 its going to be a real interesting camp our first pick myles bell this will be his first camp weve got a tremendous group of young forwards who will all have a chance to make our club like jordan weal kyle mulder clark breitkreuz spencer braaten our first pick from two years ago dominik favreau and his teammate graham hood so theres a lot of guys
5682789 the area to which you are planning to sail is the subject of an israeli navy advisory notice which warns all foreign vessels to remain clear of the designated maritime zone
5682790 we assume that your intentions are good but in fact the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organisation in gaza
5682791 israels deplorable track record of delivering supplies is in fact the very reason for our mission
5682792 i personally think it will galvanise everyone around the city not just the players but the supporters too

5682795 the particular time and place had yet to be finalised
5682796 there is a huge quantity of material which does have a specific practical value to anyone who wants to carry out terrorist activity
5682797 perhaps the most significant evidence was a video showing careful and methodical details about the construction of a suicide bombers belt packed with ball bearings
5682798 during the playing of that 20 minute video the stunned silence in court was a telling reflection of the collective horror felt by such a potent demonstration of terrorist resolve
5682799 you have brought shame on yourselves your families and your religion
5682800 even if the american economy turns around in a big way newspaper health wont magically improve because of the internet demographic and societal changes etc but newspaper companies are likely to find that their new slimmer and leaner staffed newspapers are giving them something closer to the profitability that they enjoyed in the good old days increasing page counts staff etc will interfere with that particularly as newspapers compete against an ever growing number of folks seeking to suck up ad dollars snip its inevitable that by the time the american economy improves some of the metros will have figured out how to remake the slimmer smaller staffed newspaper work for both readers and advertisers those that are successful will provide the template out of that comes the reinvented metro daily

5682811 weve seen various people have had injury problems over recent seasons im not committing to anything
5682812 theres a new generation but there always has to be someone to show the way
5682813 ive got quite a lot of top level experience i know the new generation thats coming through quite well ive always felt quite young
5682814 ive put everything towards the beam and to finally get a gold medal on my very last routine it meant the world
5682815 i remember just saying finally to finally have a gold around my neck is amazing
5682816 i actually did seven beam routines before i came out here the eighth one was the charm
5682817 to leave here with five olympic medals its just amazing and its more than a dream come true
5682818 my life has changed already watching the flag go up on that podium feels real good
5682819 coming out of a mexican american background it feels so good because not many americans get to do something like this the united states is the land of opportunities and i am glad to represent it
5682820 my mum always taught us that whatever we wanted to do we could do

5682822 we are troubled that so many athletes have been found taking the same substance
5682823 this suggests that there is at least some contact between the athletes and coaches involved in these cases
5682824 wearing traditional muslim dress has encouraged me its not an obstacle quite the opposite
5682825 it didnt have anything to do at all with my aunt
5682826 we get along fine talk on the phone from time to time but shes just a normal aunt for me
5682827 we dont have these close ties people think we do its not like we analyse training data or race results together a lot of people assume that we discuss tactics and stuff its so untrue
5682828 obviously if i ever had any questions i could always ask her or my parents or other team mates whove been to the olympics before
5682829 she said it isnt any fun parents dont want their children to do the same sports because of some unpleasant memories swimming is a tough business she said i should try something else
5682830 so one day my brother and i went along to a kayak club for children our parents urged us to give it a try it might be something wed enjoy
5682831 it was great from day one as kids wed hang out together do stuff go camping and go to races
5682832 if my name were mueller or hintze no one would care about me
5682833 so if it brings a little attention to our sport thats fine the family story is unfortunately interesting to people but im doing my own thing here
5682834 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5682835 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5682836 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5682837 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5682838 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5682839 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5682840 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5682841 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5682842 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5682883 i dont know maybe too much of me hangs over it
5682884 i think im going to go to bed are you going to go out in it again
5682885 well if you do tell me that way if lightning strikes you ill know enough to sweep up the pile of ashes in the yard
5682886 isnt it neat she used to babysit me when you had to be with christi and now shes going to be my teacher remember when she took me trick or treating because christi couldnt go out her husband let me ride on his lap on his wheelchair when they took me to the zoo

5682898 ringback tones are quickly becoming the golden child of the mobile music market due to a winning combination of consumer popularity and minimal impact from drm or piracy
5682899 the current leading mobile premium content category of realtones is already facing challenges consumers increasingly are able to create their own ringtones the price disparity compared to a full track download is also a growing factor
5682900 wireless users already love customizing their phones with ringers wallpapers and screen savers now the illumination effects on the katana eclipse provide a unique new way for people to expand on this personalization
5682901 for example a user can assign a blinking blue light for calls from mom and a glowing purple light for a text message from a girlfriend a voicemail from the boss might show up as a red echo effect some of the effects are quite subtle while others are flashy this feature is not only fun but also very practical in a lot of situations where the visual indication is quite useful
5682902 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5682903 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5682904 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5682905 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5682906 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5682907 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5682908 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5682909 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5682910 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5682911 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5682912 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5682913 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5682914 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5682915 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5682916 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5682917 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5682918 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5682919 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5682920 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5682921 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5682922 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5682923 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5682924 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5682937 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5682938 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5682939 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5682940 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5682941 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5682942 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5682943 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5682944 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5682945 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5682946 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5682947 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5683059 we get humiliated by croatia and dont qualify and some of our players dont seem to give a damn all they seem to care about is getting drunk driving fast cars and pulling women
5683060 i saw him having oral sex with a girl near the store rooms
5683061 he was sitting on a chair and the girl was kneeling in front of him
5683062 she was wearing a dress and definitely wasnt staff she was a guest she was letting the player do what he wanted he was sitting there on the chair with his pants and trousers between his knees and ankles
5683063 when she was astride him he hadnt bothered to take her clothes off or anything he just pushed her dress up and went for it
5683064 it was pretty disgusting to be honest i walked past and he glanced at me but he didnt care he was drunk and getting what he wanted
5683065 he was in a corridor where staff have their lockers behind the vip area and you have to get to it by going through two doors
5683066 they were grunting and bonking right in front of me its incredible that this should be going on so close to england becoming the laughing stock of europe by not qualifying
5683067 if the players put as much effort into playing as this one did into boozing and shagging they might have got somewhere
5683068 word got around they were there and several people came to have a look one of the managers tried to get the player to stop but he was too gone
5683069 the manager was so stunned all he could come up with was what are you doing to my chair
5683070 the girl said afterwards it was cool and she had known the player for ages but some of the staff were stunned by what had happened
5683071 the pole dancing area is up a couple of steps so everyone saw what was going on hes really going for it and you can see the girls who were wearing tiny tops and hotpants were loving it he even appears to be pretending to rub his groin as he turns to face them at one point
5683072 certainly his movement is amazing im surprised he was out so long with a knee injury because his dancing was pretty fast and furious
5683073 i recognised john terry who was very drunk he was dancing about at his table in time to the music and lapping up the attention
5683074 obviously the girls knew who he was and they kept going up to sit with him they were taking it in turns to sit on his knee and they were in high spirits
5683075 he went up to dance on stage with two partygoers he was wriggling his hips and trying to dance all sexy with the girls
5683076 i thought he was meant to be injured but he didnt show any signs of that as he larked around with the scantily clad girls
5683077 he was up on the stage for at least five minutes and people were taking pictures of him on their phones there were about seven girls two of the sexy ones danced by a pole in skimpy outfits and they got a lot of attention
5683078 later he was so drunk he peed onto the floor and someone had to clear it up
5683079 he was trying to pee into a plastic cup what sort of behaviour is that for an england captain i think they have got too much too easily
5683080 lampard was there and having a few drinks but he wasnt drunk or anything
5683081 he wasnt being very subtle about it hed had a few was desperate for a threesome and kept asking the girls i dont think he got any offers
5683082 shaun paid 50 000 for the party and some of the players ate in the restaurant before they went into the vip area
5683083 he laid on grey goose vodka and moet champagne on the tables and the players were drinking it like it was going out of fashion
5683084 loads more bottles were coming out all the time and everyone was getting really drunk
5683085 at least two girls were sick on the floor because they were tanked up so much it was horrible and shaun had a furious row with one guest who took a picture of him i dont know why he flipped out so much but there was a big scene and he grabbed the girls camera and tore out the memory stick
5683086 she was really upset and started crying and shauns pals were trying to calm him down some of these guys dont know how to behave
5683087 they think because they earn 100 000 a week they are entitled to get away with everything
5683088 considerable force upon himself and causing others to fear for his safety
5683089 it was going to take months but he was really keen to announce it he will be giving them the letter its quite amazing he will be there to do it
5683090 i miss the girls i miss being on stage with them its a blessing when we work together were so looking forward to working with each other again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
5683091 we want to assure you if there is ever a threat we will be there
5683092 it takes a neighborhood to try and take these attractions away
5683093 we need to relocate them their habitat is very small weve taken over it
5683094 this solution of the watch is not going to be consistent the coyotes will just keeping moving to another neighborhood
5683095 it doesnt seem fair we have to think of ways to help them too
5683096 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5683097 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5683098 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5683099 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5683100 it will be necessary for an indigene of port loko to take over the leadership of the party by 2012 and kemoh sesay is the right person for that position
5683101 i dont know and i have nothing to do with that ask kemoh sesay
5683102 margai was furious when his leadership came under scathing attacks by members of his party
5683103 mohamed bangura even walked out of the meeting and could not return to take part in the proceedings again
5683104 pmdc is a potential party with the right ideologies to govern this country but at this point it seemed as if these ideologies have being held to ransom by charles margai

5683107 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5683108 i feel excellent about johnson i think she needed this so much she proved she is absolutely a great balance beam gymnast
5683109 whether this move to the right in taxation attitudes will persist and to what extent it is now a fact of political life is hard to say
5683110 this literature contains appeals not to observe the laws of non muslim states such as russia and to liquidate peoples with other religious convictions
5683111 we often see a muslim leader speaking with radical statements or threats and claiming to speak for the majority of muslims said silantyev many of these leaders however have very shady backgrounds
5683112 according to the russian public prosecutors office for instance the co chairman of russias mufti council nafigullah ashirov was twice convicted for robbery and disorderly conduct
5683113 i noticed you dont seem to be playing with these any longer could we donate these and use this container to store

5683115 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games
5683116 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5683117 t he technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5683118 the methods are different but the message is the same

5683121 the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5683122 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5683123 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5683124 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5683125 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5683126 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5683127 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5683128 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5683129 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5683130 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5683131 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5683132 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5683133 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5683134 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5683135 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5683136 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5683137 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5683138 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5683139 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5683140 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5683141 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5683142 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5683143 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5683144 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5683145 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5683146 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5683147 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5683148 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5683149 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5683150 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5683151 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5683152 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5683153 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5683154 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5683155 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5683156 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5683157 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5683158 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5683159 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5683160 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5683161 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5683162 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5683163 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5683164 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5683165 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5683166 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5683167 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5683168 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5683169 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5683170 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5683171 this is a planning took where all things are going
5683172 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5683173 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5683174 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5683175 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5683176 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5683177 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5683178 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5683179 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5683180 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5683181 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5683182 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5683183 la russie doit respecter les engagements du pr sident russe dmitri medvedev nous affirmons clairement que l tablissement de nouvelles lignes de d marcation autour de la russie ne saurait se faire par la force
5683184 je ne suis pas de ceux qui croient quisoler la russie soit la bonne r ponse ses m faits je pense que la bonne r ponse cest de sengager en gardant la t te froide
5683185 nous devrions affirmer que laccord convenu doit tre respect et que les soldats russes doivent se retirer
5683186 nous ne voulons pas nous trouver dans une situation o notre relation serait en quelque sorte gel e mais tant que la russie naura pas retir ses troupes de g orgie et ne respectera pas les standards internationaux du xxie si cle nous ne pouvons pas faire comme si tout tait normal
5683187 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5683188 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5683189 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5683190 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5683191 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5683192 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5683193 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5683194 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5683195 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5683196 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5683197 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5683198 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5683199 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many

5683233 as far as links with the muslim brotherhood are concerned mab is an independent british organisation links with others extend simply to shared ideas values and expertise in which the brotherhood is indeed rich with around eight decades of experience it is not a pro terrorist organisation as browne claims and it has regularly condemned terror attacks the islamist position is fully compatible with democracy
5683234 we would have to go as far back as the medieval age when scholars were hounded and vilified in order to find a similar retrograde decision
5683235 introduce the british public to islam as a global culture and faith that spans continents races and languages
5683236 shed light over the islamic civilisation s great achievements in the various fields of knowledge from science to technology and from art to literature

5683262 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5683263 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5683264 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5683265 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5683273 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed

5683361 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5683362 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5683363 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5683364 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5683365 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5683366 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5683367 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5683368 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5683369 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5683370 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5683371 there was no division today the nato membership was clear that russia had violated international law as well as the rules of the international game

5683381 ik dacht dat de puntenkoers meer een loterij zou zijn dan de ploegkoers maar het was omgekeerd
5683382 ik ben na de wedstrijd wel eens bij de canadezen geweest om te vragen waarom zij achter ons zitten te rijden als ze al ronden achter liggen ik weet niet of het normaal is wat ze daar doen vandaag heb ik getoond dat de conditie heel goed was en dat die maagproblemen toch een geldig excuus waren voor de puntenkoers van vorige zaterdag
5683383 ik heb geen medaille dus ik kan moeilijk zeggen dat ik de beste man in koers was maar ik was toch zeker bij de beteren een medaille was mooi geweest maar net als op het bk op de weg was het net niet de britten en de zwitsers waren voor mij de favorieten maar die zaten totaal niet in koers ik ben heel tevreden dat ik het goed heb kunnen rechtzetten en dat we niet naar huis moeten met een ontgoocheling in de punten n de ploegkoers zoals in athene vier jaar geleden nu heeft iedereen kunnen zien dat ik goed was
5683384 als bolt voldoende getraind heeft op de afstand en hij zijn inspanningen goed verteerd heeft zie ik hem zeker 19 25 lopen
5683385 zulke omstandigheden zal hij niet snel meer tegenkomen om een toptijd neer te zetten de laatste dertig meter heeft hij met de armen open gelopen en op de meet heeft hij zich niet met zijn borst vooruit geworpen nee hij keek gewoon achterom om om te kijken hoeveel voorsprong hij had
5683386 michael zal er bij betrokken zijn we vinden dat we het nog n keer moeten doen dat zijn we onze fans verschuldigd michael moet erbij zijn hij is een jackson
5683387 ik heb vaak gehoord dat ik nog te jong en niet sterk genoeg was maar vandaag was ik toch rijp voor een medaille
5683388 het was een ambetante wedstrijd een paar ploegen reden rond en alle echte toppers misten de boot iljo was superieur en ik heb bewezen dat ik er ook stond het is echt superjammer we zaten op een halve ronde van goud het doel was top 8 top 5 was super en een medaille vonden we een mirakel dus vandaag hadden we hier bijna een mirakel gepresteerd
5683389 we hebben zoals meestal direct initiatief genomen want zo willen we altijd voorsprong nemen op de rest vooraleer de toppers echt doorgaan als we van in het begin de duitsers hadden meegehad in de aanval was het misschien gelukt iljo heeft me echt boven mezelf doen uitstijgen ik was al twee keer doodgegaan en op het einde dan nog een derde en vierde keer
5683390 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work

5683641 a las rusas les toca el oro se lo merecen por su regularidad por su trabajo por todo nosotras hemos mejorado much simo pero siempre ellas han estado arriba y siempre hemos querido acercarnos a ellas es l gico que ellas se merezcan el oro
5683642 las rusas cada vez nos miran m s de cerca nos tienen miedo el primer d a ni nos miraban a la cara y ya nos saludan ahora que ya saben que son primeras

5683681 it looks like acceptance experienced by a despised tax collector it looks like forgiveness experienced by a woman who had sold her body and was about to be stoned by those who didnt understand such forgiveness it looks like new meaning for a person estranged from her community who comes to the well at midday to find a mysterious young jew who tells her about the refreshing waters of eternal life it looks like healing for a man possessed by forces that drive him to dwell among the tombs but has his mind put at ease as his disease is eradicated it looks like comfort and hope for two women who are helplessly crying because their beloved brother is in the tomb it looks like hungry men sharing some loaves and fishes on a hillside like human need of all kinds being met the lame leaping for joy the blind receiving sight the deaf hearing captives released the dead brought to life again
5683682 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry

5683700 capellos only been england manager for a short period of time but i think hes made the right choice
5683701 john terry will play exactly the same as he does week in and week out thats his character but i think it will make rio better
5683702 its good for rio and will help him being vice captain means there is a good bond between the centre halfs
5683703 john terrys got something about him hes a special player on the pitch he seems like a captain he acts like a captain
5683704 the team captain will be john terry and the vice captain will be rio ferdinand
5683705 i remember when rio was captain he played very well and it was not easy for me to choose the captain
5683706 i think the big personality was the reason why i chose john the captain is very important because he drives the team
5683707 it means the world to me to retain the armband particularly with the players we have in the squad its a huge achievement
5683708 i was told about an hour before this press conference i was a little shocked to be fair rios been in awesome form
5683709 on the pitch what hes achieved at united hes been fantastic to get it above the likes of him and other players means an awful lot to me
5683710 i never gave up hope of one day wearing the armband again
5683711 my aim now is to qualify for that world cup
5683712 on the pitch and off the pitch i do an awful lot i wear my heart on my sleeve i play with everything and i give everything i can
5683713 it means a lot when people like jose mourinho and luiz felipe scolari name me captain theyve obviously seen something in me
5683714 im going to discuss it with the owners as to whether we take our chance on the ground
5683715 weve got the horse ready hes 110 you wouldnt have him any better
5683716 its a challenging track although the high concrete walls give it a very different feel to somewhere like monaco
5683717 theres a small bump as you go on and off the astilleros bridge which could unsettle the cars in the wet and then theres a 90 degree right before the track drops away and you head down a long curved straight
5683718 you brake really hard for turn 12 and it is here that it feels most like a street circuit because there are traffic lights hanging across the track and you can see buildings
5683719 youre now into the latter stages of the lap which is characterised by some fast sweeping corners they take you all the way to the final corner which is a fairly tight left hander the exit will be important because youre then heading onto the start finish straight to start another lap
5683720 est n muy ilusionados con el proyecto del bar a atl tic saben que pep les est mirando y para volver al primer equipo tienen que rendir bien aqu son jugadores que nos dan a n m s nivel del que tenemos

5683722 i didnt want to harm the man i thought he was a very nice gentleman soft spoken i thought so right up to the moment i cut his throat
5683723 as the game went on we started hitting the ball harder and harder

5683737 but for sherlyn to say yes to bigg boss she needs a great incentive

5683751 were always just a phone call away from a disaster
5683752 two or three times a day you see them gathered in the hallway brainstorming
5683753 our goal is to identify it and put some measures in place to prevent its spread
5683754 the first one i ever did was with a person who was on weight watchers and kept a log of every bite she ate ive never had one that easy since
5683755 but taste has nothing to do with it tainted food usually tastes perfectly normal

5683759 it is essential to continue and expand the current efforts being made by cdcs environmental health laboratory which monitors human levels of vitamins trans fats and omega 3 fatty acids and other indicators of nutritional and dietary status to provide the scientific data needed to make critical decisions about nutritional health for the nation
5683760 the information gleaned from these reports will provide key data to policymakers and healthcare providers to help make america a healthier nation
5683761 nacdd is proud to present and disseminate the cdc report and important white paper that interprets the findings
5683762 we plan to continue and expand this collaborative effort to advance understanding of the association between levels of selected biochemical indicators of diet and nutrition and chronic disease in the u s population

5683767 even if doesnt keep his career going hed be 28 in those olympics a peak age for wrestlers theres no doubt russia will plug an excellent athlete in his place kudukhov is already hinting he may move up
5683768 but i didnt expect to have such a strong opponent
5683769 every opponent in every freestyle weight class in beijing had better expect one from russia among those to come two time olympic champion buvaysa saitiev who goes for his third gold at 74 kg on wednesday
5683770 having a balanced diet is so important for a healthy lifestyle
5683771 if children havent eaten and go to school then their energy levels will be low and it can affect their concentration and learning
5683772 if you eat toast then it should be on wholemeal balanced breakfasts include wholemeal cereal with milk yogurt and glass of orange juice scrambled eggs on brown bread and baked beans are really good for you
5683773 people should eat a low fat breakfast a couple of pieces of fruit and a bowl of scottish porridge it is a much better start to the day than some sad looking thing that is cold dried up and out of a packet

5683776 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
5683777 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision

5683796 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5683797 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5683798 the reason is that they broadcast disinformation during the war that affects our population badly and puts people under stress
5683799 i would not call it media what they broadcast and print is just propaganda and we dont want to scare our population with this disinformation
5683800 when we let them broadcast again we dont know lets see

5683808 this survey data offers cause for concern about the financial habits of lmi americans especially those of hispanic descent
5683809 despite access to financial information low and moderate income people show very low awareness of basic financial concepts such as personal credit as well as of financial products that often constitute the foundation of personal wealth not surprisingly many need smarter money management habits particularly with regard to credit and debt providing education and access to asset building products seem to be the logical first steps to bridge this gap

5683820 as a physician to sufferers of critical limb ischemia i am extremely proud to be involved in developing therapeutic applications using the erc cell if approved by the fda we may one day provide this patient population with an option to amputation
5683821 since the normal function of the erc in a womans body is to generate new blood vessels on a monthly basis it is logical that these cells would generate new blood vessels in limbs that suffer from poor circulation and our current studies support this
5683822 given that dr murphy has experience with therapeutic applications for stem cells in critical limb ischemia we are honored to have him lead these studies which will be a key component in an upcoming submission to the fda
5683823 we have been partnering with version3 for the past several years by purchasing and integrating their applications into our solutions
5683824 through this working relationship we developed a true appreciation for the genius of their product and their software development team and have members of the csi team who have developed expertise with the version3 solutions we believe that csi will gain meaningful advantages by controlling distribution of their products and having access to their microsoft development team their solutions provide a natural bridge between our software and technology segments as we are able to wrap systems engineering services around the delivery of their suite of products
5683825 from a financial perspective we are pleased to have acquired version3 via an equity transaction by issuing csi stock at what we believe is an attractive multiple
5683826 we mitigated the impact of dilution to csi shareholders by placing a portion of these shares in escrow for release over the next three years as version3 achieves its performance targets
5683827 we are very excited to be joining the csi team the csi sales force immediately increases the scope and depth of our coverage and the technical services resources bolsters our capabilities in implementation and delivery we believe its the perfect union of a company that is highly skilled in specialized software development joining a company that excels in selling and implementation

5683867 due to its oral activity and plausible long term durable response rate seen in ra patients in the initial multi center placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial oral dnajp1 may have an important clinical advantage over current injectable ra treatments which have significant toxicities our preliminary studies also strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of dnajp1 is complementary to current biologics thus providing the opportunity to develop combination therapies which may improve currently used regimens the long term statistically significant improvement in clinical scores as seen by acr20 and acr50 following cessation of drug therapy further suggests that this technology may be inducing a tolerogenic response
5683868 we are pleased to have broadened our therapeutic pipeline of products with the acquisition of this innovative program oral dnajp1 certainly complements our existing clinical stage immunology programs which include trimesta our oral phase ii iii clinical program in multiple sclerosis and our cd4 inhibitor technology we have been equally impressed with the rigor and quality of the scientific data along with the level of grant funding this program has received over the years from the nih we look forward to reporting additional clinical data from this study later this year

5684012 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5684013 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5684273 as far as records management systems go theres nothing out there has never been anything and this is groundbreaking with respect to providing that kind of information to police officers everywhere
5684274 the pip portal sits among all participants acting as an information search engine and request broker individual agencies decide what information they want to make available to other law enforcement agencies while retaining ownership of the data the portal contains only an index of information and not the contents of an electronic record
5684275 its more about having record management systems that can speak to each other
5684276 when it comes to sharing of information its always a challenge to try and put something together that will serve the needs nationally weve worked with a number of agencies across canada to try and make that happen and in fact it has happened
5684277 weve had cpic for 35 years but it deals more with the hard facts such as if there is a warrant for arrest for a person or if there is a court appearance there may not be any charges at all
5684278 is the 95 per cent of the data that wasnt being shared
5684279 cpic is not about the same thing thats information thats put on there by police agencies as a result of some kind of action if you will whereas records management systems are about all the information that police officers collect in the course of a day
5684280 pip is really targeted to help the front line officer and the investigator know who they are dealing with
5684281 you have everything from very sophisticated offenders who move from one jurisdiction to another to avoid detection or you may get a predator operating in a large geographic area and you want to know what everyone else knows there may be a situation where one police agency has him stopped for one thing and another police agency has information on him for a completely different thing but when you put it all together it helps the investigator connect the dots it could be everything from organized crime to terrorism

5684337 we do believe that peace keeping efforts need to take place in somalia
5684338 we do believe that the ethiopian forces should not have to stay in somalia past a certain point but its going to require peacekeeping forces to be fairly robust peacekeeping forces and so that will be part of my discussion
5684339 that is really an agreement that we cannot afford to let unravel

5684343 some journalists told the whole world that i am already dead i saw this on the television but you see me now i think this is enough proof they are liars
5684344 we have two track options first is the liberation of somalia through military struggle the second is through diplomatic efforts
5684345 we warn ethiopia to withdraw immediately it is now or never and in a few weeks they will not have a route to withdraw
5684346 i am a somali nationalist fighting for a free and united somalia
5684347 and this is considered by the us administration to be terrorism

5684354 if this is an accurate measure of our science education then we have a lot of work to do
5684355 the same pressures that came to bear for schools in math and reading will happen in science
5684356 just the fact that these are being published in newspapers puts tremendous pressure on schools
5684357 we have to seriously look at how we structure the school day because science shouldnt be just mastering a series of facts
5684358 there should be time for students to really explore subjects in depth and conduct the kind of hands on work that gives people a sense as to how science actually happens

5684364 the cabinet is largely a benchmark that has been used to gauge how influential a certain clan is in the government going by the portfolio being held by a clan representative
5684365 these clan fighters also make up a large part of the insurgents because many are sympathisers of the ousted islamists
5684366 ethiopia is looking for a partner so that it can contain separatist forces in the ogaden region and the interim administration is the most likely choice
5684367 the zeal with which ethiopia is carrying out the operation against the insurgents and clan fighters in mogadishu is a clear indication that crippling their military power and influence is another way of countering rebels in ogaden region
5684368 this was just a group of businessmen and members of the hawiye clan whose goal was to get power and shield their interests through islam

5684428 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5684429 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5684430 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons

5684439 quality software remains a key business differentiator businesses and the it organizations supporting them have no choice with regard to quality initiatives and the need to address the debilitating costs of software defects
5684440 organizations should evaluate current process and organizational approaches to software quality in combination with automated approaches for code analysis and testing to help enable more secure successful better managed software implementations
5684441 based on our collaboration with idc the industry now has hard data confirming what nearly every software development organization has suspected for years quality problems are consuming significant resources and still compromise the integrity of software in the field
5684442 development organizations today need innovative tools that automate the tedious process of defect detection so their valued developers can stay focused on delivering new features and functionality instead of debugging problems left over from previous releases

5684469 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures

5684486 the behavioral therapy is designed to help families find ways to break that cycle
5684487 it encourages and structures the family situation so that eating is expected
5684488 but we tell the parent we realize you have been through an incredible amount already
5684489 so its teaching the parents to talk in a positive manner thats supportive again it helps the parent become part of the solution in that regard
5684490 i would come out of the hospital and immediately stop eating again because i would be put back in the same environment that triggered it
5684491 as we found out with her illness youre afraid to talk about it and open up about things
5684492 communication completely breaks down because you dont want to upset her

5684526 concerned that earths climate will change to an unacceptable degree or at an unacceptable rate before economies can shift significantly away from carbon based energy sources some scientists have begun casting their eyes in a previously shunned direction geoengineering or intentional and large scale intervention to prevent or slow changes in the climate system geoengineering sometimes refers strictly to techniques for increasing earths albedo or reflectivity to lower its temperature and compensate for greenhouse warming more broadly the term can include efforts to accelerate some of the natural processes for removal of co 2 from the atmosphere many such ideas have been around for decades in the past few years however the debate over their potential deployment has intensified

5684552 breach of these provisions in the pensions act is a criminal offence it is for this reason that we take such a serious view of your story we are now considering whether there has been any potential breach of the restricted information provisions and what if any action to take

5684554 subs do not just clean up typos and dodgy punctuation or cut copy to fit they also
5684555 the teaching language needs to support or focus on the more basic concepts and that may be slightly different to what is going on now
5684556 nobody is disputing the fact that you need language to build a more complicated set of ideas but language isnt the starter kit
5684557 there is a clear basis on which children can build but it isnt a linguistic basis

5684563 this was a sickening attack on a vulnerable elderly man and we are appealing to the public to help bring the two men responsible to justice
5684564 the victim uses a walking stick and is unsteady on his feet so he may have been quite noticeable to people who were in the area at the time
5684565 anyone who witnessed the assault or who saw the two men following the victim from shandwick place are urged to contact police as a matter of urgency
5684566 similarly anyone who has any other information that can help us identify the suspects should get in touch immediately

5684572 i wanted them to have to really believe that they could go i wrote on my handlebars today sing like adam kreek our mens eights rower who bellowed out the national anthem during the gold medal ceremony

5684574 and we had the courage to put it out there that this is what we wanted to do and triathlon canada had the courage to support that and im very very proud of that because i was afraid really i had some moments there where i was like what have i done you know because this is a scary prospect im sure the mens eight felt the same way
5684575 thats got to be the best race of his career

5684582 we need to do a major education effort aimed at the public because the stigma with mental illness is clearly clearly out there
5684583 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5684584 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5684585 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long

5684649 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools

5684655 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5684656 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5684657 the dollars recent rise was driven mainly by falls in oil prices
5684658 but because the majority view is that there is more room for falls in oil prices the dollars current fall is only a correction and its expected to resume rising again
5684659 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5684660 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact

5684662 churches are made up of people like you and me
5684663 jesus is a figure of intense interest and even admiration for millions his stories and sayings still inhabit our minds two thousand years after he taught on the other side of the globe he published no books founded no dynasty led no army and governed no nation but his images and stories and teachings and followers have girdled the globe presenting a message of a savior who sacrifices himself out of love and to most this is compellingly beautiful then there is the church if you have grown up in a church you have reasons to be disillusioned the church seems like a boring topic for most and a duty reluctantly fulfilled for many in stark contrast with many of the unforgettable sayings of christ we cant remember what we heard in most sermons ten minutes after we get home people around the world arent interested in our church for that matter people just around the corner arent either churches have published books and fielded armies and ruled kings and even so if you introduce the topic of the church youll often find it met with responses ranging from a mild disinterest to a real dislike we can understand why churches say they have the best and most important news in the world they have the answer to our problems they are gods embassies on earth yet churches are made up of people like you and me people who are grumpy irritable unfaithful and selfish we become too possessive of small things and too casual about great ones we become too defensive for ourselves and ignore god we talk of love but we too often give ourselves over to hate even in church
5684664 id really like it to become known in the culture as the new solitaire
5684665 she was called into the diary room and spoke to her agent and then her consultant in the uk

5684668 she went for tests and results have come back and she has cancer of the womb

5684671 alexs passing has left an indescribable void in the loves of his family and friends
5684672 to allow ourselves to get lost in the mix of grief sorrow and loss would do a disservice to the memory of alex
5684673 if every person would do one positive thing in honor of alex honor the life he loved then we can make a difference in our community
5684674 if you are looking for photos of sport cars search engines will give you thumbnails with links to pages containing the images outwit will directly put the high resolution pictures in a folder on your hard disk if you want stock quotes search engines will tell you where to find the figures outwit will put them into a spreadsheet on your desktop
5684675 my concern is when you say youre looking for ideas and innovation in education the assumption could be that were not innovative now or that if more money would be provided it would be more of the same
5684676 the fact is thats not true we have great ideas but we cant do better without the money for infrastructure to build on what were already doing
5684677 its a big part of not being able to fulfill some aspects
5684678 its really inspiring that the governor is taking the time to listen to everybody and come up with a plan
5684679 and im just overwhelmed with so many ideas after hearing everyone speak even the students who spoke and theyre the ones who really know whats needed
5684680 after this series of conversations is complete well work to take everything weve learned and heard on how to change
5684681 those resources are never going to be available to you without the people of ohio getting behind your efforts
5684682 if you can engage people in ohio we can solve the dilemma thats confounded our state for far too long thats what were trying to do now engage ohio
5684683 something i think we need to look at is building in time for teachers preparing and time for teachers as professionals to really improve our craft
5684684 its very hard to design a specific plan for a student if you dont have the time to look at those methods available or work with other teachers maybe we could extend the school year to 200 days but not have all those days be face to face with kids
5684685 an early dismissal and a couple of waiver days is not enough
5684686 and i think the tremendously important point is that what makes the difference is the teacher
5684687 we probably have too many tests and im not sure the tests measure what we want them to measure
5684688 the amount of carbohydrate that could be stored by the muscles when ingested with caffeine was about 60pc higher than with carbohydrates alone this increase makes athletes go further
5684689 i was in the top 10 percent of my graduating class but i didnt realize until i got to college how less fortunate and far behind we were than everybody else
5684690 when your classes are in a trailer you have no sense of pride
5684691 we were unprepared academically and in terms of resources were also far behind other school districts
5684692 i didnt fully understand that until i got to college conditions were terrible in our schools it was a struggle
5684693 i dont think were going in the right direction i dont think unions are getting a good shake
5684694 we need to bring jobs here not send them to china
5684695 i want to get people engaged in educational issues in the state to move the state forward
5684696 in addition to education important of course i look at jobs in ohio
5684697 i want to stay in ohio after graduation as a college student jobs are important
5684698 i think that we do need to move toward universal health care
5684699 i am one of 47 million americans who do not have health insurance
5684700 health care is always a concern but so is cost containment
5684701 costs put pressure on the company we were concerned about the energy bill our company still has to negotiate with aep american electric power
5684702 weve been able to come back after the strike of an employment of 850 nearly what we had before things are good
5684703 i would like him to run after his second term once he has ohio in good shape
5684704 they sent a letter to us about this event and we thought it would be nice to do its enjoyable
5684705 i think the governor is an honest man and you can depend on him
5684706 is a very very challenging time in our nation and state
5684707 we need to get our economy back on track to set priorities to protect the people to re establish leadership in the world
5684708 economic ups and downs are more serious today and require us to be willing to make the right decisions for our nation and for our state
5684709 a different god mitt romney the religious right and the mormon question
5684710 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
5684711 i think governor romney must see himself as a symbol
5684712 he didnt make any promises but he listened to our concerns
5684713 there was a movement in washington d c to get rid of cdbg
5684714 but we went to the mat for that issue and won cdbg is important to our appalachian communities
5684715 its a 250 000 square foot building that used to house walker systems
5684716 the japanese are really big on obtaining high quality buildings and that was one of the best buildings they had found so that was instrumental in their choice to locate there
5684717 senator rockefeller is probably the biggest specialist on japan in the senate
5684718 i think we could squeeze him a little for the ohio side too
5684719 the river shouldnt be a boundary to economic development on both sides
5684720 in west virginia economic development is a main concern of their congressional delegation
5684721 each senator and representative has his own strengths and all have an area of expertise
5684722 id love to see something like that in ohio that our representatives could work more together to support each other
5684723 west virginia has turned things around through cooperation and i think ohio is closer to that now with gov ted strickland being from this area he could bring our representatives together
5684724 and our mahle engine components usa inc plant is leaving
5684725 there are 300 to 350 employees who will lose their jobs and their average age is 52 we know the government promises to retrain them but what will they be trained for
5684726 its hard to find any place with developed infrastructure that isnt experiencing economic development
5684727 o blog como linguagem informativa a atua o profissional de blogueiros e os novos conflitos na cultura
5684728 a number of students contacted us at the office by telephone and e mail asking us about their admissions
5684729 we were trying to find them on the system trying to help them with their inquiry but the numbers didnt match up the names didnt match up the dates of birth didnt match and some of the courses werent true either
5684730 then we tried to get more information from them a number of students sent the letter to us and we could see that it was fraudulent
5684731 they had paid money for the letter to someone in nigeria
5684732 i strongly urge applicants to select their educational consultant or agent very carefully and if possible contact the university directly to find out who the officially appointed agents are
5684733 in nigeria we work with global education study centres and infozee
5684734 its a dream come true for students to come here to the uk to study
5684735 most of the scammers take advantage of this dream they take advantage of the fact that they are desperate and really want to make their dreams come true
5684736 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5684737 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5684738 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5684739 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5684740 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5684741 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5684742 we ought not to rest content in the mists of the valley when the summit of tabor awaits us how pure are the dews of the hills how fresh is the mountain air how rich is the fare of the dwellers aloft whose windows look into the new jerusalem many saints are content to live like men in coal mines who see not the sun tears mar their faces when they might anoint them with celestial oil satisfied i am that many a believer pines in a dungeon when he might walk on the palace roof and view the goodly land and lebanon rouse thee o believer from they low condition cast away thy sloth thy lethargy thy coldness or whatever interferes with they chaste and pure love to christ make him the source the center and the circumference of all they souls range of delight rest no longer satisfied with thy dwarfish attainments aspire to a higher a nobler a fuller life upward to heaven nearer to god spurgeon
5684743 not many of us are living at our best we linger in the lowlands because we are afraid to climb the mountains the steepness and ruggedness dismay us and so we stay in the misty valleys and do not learn the mystery of the hills we do not know what we lose in our self indulgence what glory awaits us if only we had the courage for the mountain climb what blessing we should find if only we would move to the uplands of god j r m
5684744 father may i always be willing to climb the mountains in my life and may i always desire to climb them may i not let the difficulty of the journey the energy and strain it requires lethargy complacency fear or anything else hold me back from facing the challenge and striving to climb the mountains you bring me to
5684745 i knew if i boxed my fight and put him under pressure he wouldnt last the pace
5684746 i got a medal but i want the medal which is the gold
5684747 i cant wait to fight zou shiming i want the gold and i know i can go further but if not ive got my medal
5684748 well we were playing cricket and little jimmy smacked the ball high so i jumped for it and rolled just like on the tv now my leg hurts and my wrist is shaped like a fork i forgot i was 87 and had two hip replacements

5684772 we denken dat iemand die hier gefrustreerd buitenkwam zich heeft gewroken
5684773 ik heb vaak gehoord dat ik nog te jong en niet sterk genoeg was maar vandaag was ik toch rijp voor een medaille
5684774 het was een ambetante wedstrijd een paar ploegen reden rond en alle echte toppers misten de boot iljo was superieur en ik heb bewezen dat ik er ook stond het is echt superjammer we zaten op een halve ronde van goud het doel was top 8 top 5 was super en een medaille vonden we een mirakel dus vandaag hadden we hier bijna een mirakel gepresteerd
5684775 we hebben zoals meestal direct initiatief genomen want zo willen we altijd voorsprong nemen op de rest vooraleer de toppers echt doorgaan als we van in het begin de duitsers hadden meegehad in de aanval was het misschien gelukt iljo heeft me echt boven mezelf doen uitstijgen ik was al twee keer doodgegaan en op het einde dan nog een derde en vierde keer
5684776 ik dacht dat de puntenkoers meer een loterij zou zijn dan de ploegkoers maar het was omgekeerd
5684777 ik ben na de wedstrijd wel eens bij de canadezen geweest om te vragen waarom zij achter ons zitten te rijden als ze al ronden achter liggen ik weet niet of het normaal is wat ze daar doen vandaag heb ik getoond dat de conditie heel goed was en dat die maagproblemen toch een geldig excuus waren voor de puntenkoers van vorige zaterdag
5684778 ik heb geen medaille dus ik kan moeilijk zeggen dat ik de beste man in koers was maar ik was toch zeker bij de beteren een medaille was mooi geweest maar net als op het bk op de weg was het net niet de britten en de zwitsers waren voor mij de favorieten maar die zaten totaal niet in koers ik ben heel tevreden dat ik het goed heb kunnen rechtzetten en dat we niet naar huis moeten met een ontgoocheling in de punten n de ploegkoers zoals in athene vier jaar geleden nu heeft iedereen kunnen zien dat ik goed was

5684878 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
5684879 all of the empirical studies published in english in peer reviewed journals since 1989 that compared the mental health of women who had an induced abortion to comparison groups of women or that examined factors that predict mental health among women who have had an elective abortion in the united states
5684880 women terminating a wanted pregnancy who perceived pressure from others to terminate their pregnancy or who perceived a need to keep their abortion secret from their family and friends because of stigma associated with abortion were more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following abortion

5684904 we educators are under scrutiny everyday as it is but if we have to continue to worry about lawsuits and being arrested were in that much more danger

5684906 with the situation here i felt i needed to do something that was important to me
5684907 i had a great experience at n c state and it was a special place for me over the last 21 2 years the entire coaching staff and the support staff have been great to me i want to thank them and my teammates i wish them all the best

5684931 capellos only been england manager for a short period of time but i think hes made the right choice
5684932 john terry will play exactly the same as he does week in and week out thats his character but i think it will make rio better
5684933 its good for rio and will help him being vice captain means there is a good bond between the centre halfs
5684934 john terrys got something about him hes a special player on the pitch he seems like a captain he acts like a captain
5684935 it means the world to me to retain the armband particularly with the players we have in the squad its a huge achievement
5684936 i was told about an hour before this press conference i was a little shocked to be fair rios been in awesome form
5684937 on the pitch what hes achieved at united hes been fantastic to get it above the likes of him and other players means an awful lot to me

5684946 its a challenging track although the high concrete walls give it a very different feel to somewhere like monaco
5684947 theres a small bump as you go on and off the astilleros bridge which could unsettle the cars in the wet and then theres a 90 degree right before the track drops away and you head down a long curved straight
5684948 you brake really hard for turn 12 and it is here that it feels most like a street circuit because there are traffic lights hanging across the track and you can see buildings
5684949 youre now into the latter stages of the lap which is characterised by some fast sweeping corners they take you all the way to the final corner which is a fairly tight left hander the exit will be important because youre then heading onto the start finish straight to start another lap

5684959 but the mistake many travelers make is ending their vacation search based on that alone hotel pricing in many cities has stayed relatively flat compared to 2007 the hotel stay is typically the most expensive part of any vacation so steady and in some cases decreasing prices means that skipping the vacation this year may not be necessary
5684960 the increase in hotel pricing in new york may be related to an influx of international tourists and a strong enough demand for hotel rooms that boosts the adr
5684961 international monitoring of the agreed ceasefire and of the humanitarian situation is urgently needed the osce has extensive experience on the ground in the region and is well placed to respond swiftly some of the details must still be worked out but the agreed increase in the number of monitors will enable the osce to help stabilize the situation and support international relief efforts

5684992 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5684993 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5684994 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5684995 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5684996 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5684997 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5684998 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back

5685004 one huge problem of the fhs is that it does not easily allow one to have multiple versions of a program installed this is what has lead to the whole so 1 2 3 mess as well

5685009 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5685010 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5685011 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5685012 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5685013 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5685014 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5685015 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5685016 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5685017 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5685018 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5685019 i heard he killed him ate him then shat him out and ate him again

5685027 it takes time but i think he did good out there
5685028 today was a big step for him he did a good job i was impressed with his instincts when we switched off a couple things hopefully come game time hell be 100 percent
5685029 everyone kind of knew i didnt warm up properly i talked to trainers about it its something were going to be doing pregame especially for late games with the monday night games we have i need a routine to get up in the mornings and get going
5685030 it feels good but there definitely is some weakness in there im trying to get the strength and range of motion back a bit but its healing pretty good
5685031 it hurts a little bit just in evaluating the young players giving them game experience and opportunity and then seeing them over the long haul of things
5685032 someone picked up on omar saying it and its stuck with me ever since
5685033 you see him in on a lot of plays out there so i think his progression is going well he certainly makes it hard for offenses when you have a guy like that whos strong and who can run and who can hit
5685034 not only do you have to know the plays for yourself but you have to tell everyone else whats going on
5685035 its just a matter of learning the defense and having a grasp of it at the middle linebacker position where youre in charge of everything he just has to continue to learn
5685036 hes going to get some practice time in there this week
5685037 he played very good football this past week not only from the backfield carrying the football but he was taking special teams very seriously
5685038 just from playing last year you understand brian is going to play and there is not much room for a lot of other guys to play you know you want to get onto the field any time they want to put you on the field its a good thing
5685039 hes a big guy so he can definitely take a pounding
5685040 just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough
5685041 but that is not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position
5685042 i know its a challenge for him to learn a new position with blocking schemes and stuff
5685043 its going to be something to sit back and watch hopefully hell do well with it
5685044 im going to have to put more time into it as far as the position change goes its not one of the easiest but fullback and tailback go hand in hand
5685045 pass blocking is the same its not like i have to learn too much more for the most part you know a lot of the fullback responsibility from being a running back i would say its just the run blocking
5685046 hes a great kid he wants to be on the field he doesnt care where he plays he wants to play well give him a shot
5685047 i think he has done a great job right now
5685048 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5685049 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5685050 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5685051 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5685052 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla
5685053 we need to find a spot for this guy somewhere
5685054 thats about it just from playing last year you understand that brians going to play at running back and theres not really much room for a lot of other guys to play you just know that you just want to play football you want to get in the game so any time theyre telling you they want to put you on the football field thats a good thing
5685055 im not going to say i expected it but i was ready for it
5685056 he has to be able to block or at least sustain a block where hes not getting pushed back and then understand his leverage of that
5685057 then he has to be effective in the pass game and be able to catch the football and the handful of times that we give him the ball during the season he has to be productive with those we ask our fullback to be a good special teams player or at least a contributor so that ends up being the main part
5685058 the thing he has improved at most is we knew he could run the football but hes a special teams player he deserves an opportunity hes a big kid who wants to be on the field and he doesnt really care where he plays he just wants to play so well give him a shot
5685059 i think its something that hes going to have to work hard to be able to do in such a quick time
5685060 tony is an athletic guy hes also a big guy so definitely can take a pounding and he can do it its just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough youll be able to see what he can do when he gets in there on friday
5685061 maybe it would have been better earlier but thats not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position most things are the same you just know it because youre in the same meeting room its not really much of a change pass plays youre still doing the same thing on every pass play the only thing that changes is the run blocking and its not that hard the guys going to come to you its more about just wanting to do it
5685062 surprise me no i kind of came in here expecting a lot of curveballs and twists and turns
5685063 for me now its a four man race instead of three

5685108 as we were flying over the desert we landed in the middle of nowhere
5685109 theres no doubt that americans possess the resources and passion to close off our borders and ports from illegal immigration and contraband
5685110 i dont lay the blame on our dedicated border agents
5685111 lets ask ourselves why is congress not securing our borders
5685112 we are not in the position to speculate on the outcome of the investigation but after several incidents like these it would be appropriate for apple to take some measures to raise the publics awareness

5685129 the war set the stage for a more comprehensive middle east conflict
5685130 it set into motion a dynamic in the arab world where much of the arab street believes that hezbollah won that war and there is tremendous expectation on hezbollah to continue the struggle
5685131 we destroyed all of hezbollahs infrastructure much of its civilian headquarters we killed about a quarter of their fighters that is a prohibitive number of casualties for any modern fighting force and yet perception is everything in the middle east and the perception was in the arab world at least that israel was bested in that conflict
5685132 israel would then have to reply into lebanon possibly drawing in the syrians and ultimately the iranians
5685133 attracting the best and brightest into the industry is a challenge its not happening
5685134 essentially we took the nobility and the necessity out of it and replaced it with this vague sense of drudgery
5685135 in the last several years all of the benefits of a career in the trades have kind of gotten lost in the clutter of all the other career opportunities
5685136 what the industry needs is to be much more aggressive in marketing and creating visibility
5685137 its not like going to college where you go to school for five to eight years and have to work a part time job
5685138 i chose the path that i wanted to take and learned as much as i could for that one thing
5685139 you go to college to kind of figure out what you want to do but if you dont figure it out you go out with debt and you still dont know

5685141 furthers californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5685142 the california supreme courts decision proves that these activist judges are willing to deny our first amendment religious freedom in order to create rights for homosexuals
5685143 today californias highest court unanimously ruled that the states civil rights laws offer virtually no exceptions for people of faith
5685144 a religious objector has no federal constitutional right to an exemption from a neutral and valid law of general applicability on the ground that compliance with that law is contrary to the objectors religious beliefs
5685145 for instance the ruling probably means that regardless of their beliefs everyone in the states wedding industry must service gay weddings california family law attorneys must handle gay adoptions and same sex divorces and so on
5685146 if homosexual marriage remains legal the courts will soon start mandating homosexual marriage ceremonies in all churches
5685147 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever

5685183 public discussion of global warming is befogged by contrarians whose opinions are given a megaphone by special interests that benefit by keeping the public confused some of the contrarians were once scientists but now they behave at least on the topic of global warming as lawyers defending a client their aim is to present a case as effectively as possible citing only evidence that supports their client and making the story appear as favorable as possible to their client the best the most articulate are sought out by special interests and even by much of the media because the media likes to have balance in its coverage of most topics and especially this topic because special interests have influence on the media
5685184 the claimed threat rests on two key propositions deriving from united nations reports that global temperatures are determined mainly by carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and that human activity especially the use of fossil fuels is increasing these to historically high and dangerous levels but as research continues and understanding grows things look less straightforward and less dire existing doubts about a simple link between temperature and carbon dioxide were reinforced by a paper given at bayreuth university last month this reported that during at least three substantial periods in the last 200 years carbon dioxide levels have equalled or exceeded those prevailing today although temperatures were lower on the second point subsequent studies indicate that the united nations report substantially underestimated natural contributions to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consequently exaggerating those attributable to human activity a report that the contribution from human activity is much less than the un suggested has been endorsed by 31 000 scientists many more than advised the un
5685185 existing doubts about a simple link between temperature and carbon dioxide were reinforced by a paper given at bayreuth university last month this reported that during at least three substantial periods in the last 200 years carbon dioxide levels have equalled or exceeded those prevailing today although temperatures were lower

5685193 the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5685194 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store
5685195 emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5685196 we thought it would be a long process but she was greedy
5685197 we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers
5685198 she thelma has seen justice before she dies she was glad to hear the sentence
5685199 we can confirm that a former health care assistant employed by the provider arm of liverpool primary care trust has been arrested and convicted of stealing from a patient
5685200 liverpool primary care trust has fully supported merseyside police in this investigation and the member of staff involved was immediately suspended following their arrest

5685202 gobolinux tries to replace the legacy layout instead of going the way of stacked layouts giving us yet another standard layout as if its underlying reasons were superior than fhs i think theyre not
5685203 fhss goal is to allow apps to find their files and other apps files and libraries in a portable way among unix systems its a functional layout aimed at portability and interoperability
5685204 one huge problem of the fhs is that it does not easily allow one to have multiple versions of a program installed this is what has lead to the whole so 1 2 3 mess as well

5685207 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
5685208 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
5685209 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
5685210 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5685211 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5685212 the data is quite convincing based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5685213 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5685214 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
5685215 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4
5685216 our inflation figures are way above that but what it tells us is that the productive base of the economy has really shrunk
5685217 we really need to change the way we do business
5685218 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5685219 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months

5685225 the game of tennis is similar to the game of life
5685226 its a one on one sport where theres no one coaching you on the court and you have to figure it out on your own when your match is over is when you can get advice on what you did right and what you did wrong but for the most part it requires incredible self discipline and self control
5685227 my parents taught me that if you want something its up to you to get out there and bust your butt to make it happen
5685228 no one is going to hand anything to you my parents are my role models
5685229 while i was training in florida they graciously hosted me and my coach plus they also give me great advice about tennis and on life in general
5685230 because i was on the court instead of in the streets i escaped the life that so many young black brothers fall victim to gangs jail and teenage fatherhood
5685231 i made it a personal goal for myself to teach as many children the game of tennis as possible in hopes of seeing them get a tennis scholarship to attend college and saving their parents money
5685232 i figure if they can get into college on a tennis scholarship after about two years they might consider going pro
5685233 seeing an adult or a child hit their first tennis ball and it makes it over the net and stays in the court is a very rewarding feeling
5685234 as a tennis instructor nothing can compare to being there to witness your student whether theyre children or adults win their first match or tournament thats what i enjoy most about teaching tennis
5685235 come out to the arthur ashe tennis courts on a saturday morning we have adults young adults and children mostly black right here from south los angeles playing tennis in addition we have blacks come from all over southern california to play tennis at the arthur ashe tennis center because this is where most blacks who play tennis play in l a theres a real sense of camaraderie and focus on helping anyone interested in learning how to play theres nothing white or bourgeoisie about the game of tennis during south africas apartheid arthur ashe was denied a visa by the south african government keeping him out of the south african open he used the opportunity to call attention to south africas racism against blacks the williams sisters came straight out of compton in fact most people arent aware that there is still a lot of racism in tennis against blacks just ask venus and serena black people need to realize that when we use terms like acting white and bourgeoisie we discourage each other from reaching our full potential its no different than when kids tease each with acting white for being good students and brining home as on their report cards for me it comes down to knowing where your child is after school or for them to act black and join a gang and run the streets eventually ending up in jail or worse dead tennis is an opportunity much like we view basketball and football for our youth both females and males to excel in life why should white children be the only ones taking advantage of that
5685236 regina recently won her first tournament her sister maya pitts is fast on reginas heels at the age of five maya can already hit the ball from the baseline i credit the success of richard williams and his daughters venus and serena with inspiring a whole new generation of black tennis players the way that arthur ashe inspired me

5685249 it is important to remember that the adventure activities sector as a whole has almost always demonstrated good practices in risk assessment and management allowing activities to take place safely and enjoyably
5685250 hse firmly believes that children must have the opportunity to participate in adventurous activities such as climbing which are fun healthy and provide experience and education in risk management statistically one incident does not alter the good track record of an overall safe and well managed sector

5685252 this funding commitment underscores the government of canadas belief in this important initiative to improve the quality of life of canadians and their families dealing with mental illness
5685253 some of the best experts in the mental health field in canada are working with the commission
5685254 i applaud the government for its continued commitment to improve mental health in canada
5685255 for far too long mental health has not received the attention it deserves in this country
5685256 the canadian mental health association enthusiastically applauds the federal governments announcement of increased support of the mental health commission of canada this is a tremendous vote of confidence in the commission and a most encouraging sign of the importance of mental health as a national issue
5685257 the cmha looks forward to working closely with the commission in achieving its challenging mandate which will be much more feasible with this support
5685258 in our presentation to colleagues we pointed out that despite medicines ability to treat and diagnose psychiatric illness as effectively and accurately as it can diagnose and treat most chronic conditions in internal medicine far too many people dont get access to care
5685259 we must commit to ensuring that such discrimination is no longer tolerated this includes advocating for parity of resources for care resources devoted to treating psychiatric illnesses should be similar to that committed to physical illnesses with equivalent levels of disability
5685260 we asked our colleagues to work together as physicians to transform patient care for mental illnesses beginning by fighting stigma within our own profession and physician organizations we also asked that they advocate for parity of resources for mental health research and the full range of services needed to treat mental illness we are encouraged by the support shown by our colleagues in passing a number of motions for collaborative action
5685261 todays announcement of additional funding for the mental health commission of canada is an encouraging sign that we are on the right track toward transforming mental health care in canada
5685262 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5685263 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5685264 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5685265 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5685266 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5685267 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5685268 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5685269 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5685270 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5685271 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5685272 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5685273 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
5685274 belief that he alone was a saint and all others villains

5685278 nasa engineers and designers were coached by celerant to think outside the box when approaching design during a three day training course
5685279 celerant is fully committed to supporting nasa as they apply innovative thinking and design to 21st century space programs
5685280 meeting these challenging design requirements calls for a novel training approach that enables engineers to go from the fuzzy front divergent end of innovation to the application of tools and methods for converging on final design solutions
5685281 celerant is thrilled to have been selected for this essential program and looks forward to a collaborative future with nasa
5685282 why are you taking it so lightly i do not like this casual approach

5685285 our second quarter modestly exceeded our expectations despite continued soft sales trends we continue to focus on driving our financial results through superior execution and discipline and by continuing to delight our guests with differentiated merchandise at a compelling value
5685286 a 100 increase in the number of authorized shares is in our opinion excessive and will provide for enormous dilution of the current shareholders we are simply unaware of any that in a single action has doubled its authorized shares which gives the board of directors essentially unlimited latitude to issue stock without shareholder oversight further we are unable to see how such an action would advance the stated objectives of servidyne for these reasons kandu presently intends to vote against this proposal
5685287 for fall we believe our merchandise selections are compelling our marketing is creative and our stores look great we are excited about the completion of several important store renovation projects however we know we are continuing to face the headwinds of the economic and retail environment consequently we are approaching the near term conservatively and believe our 2008 operating margin excluding certain items will decline from 2007 levels
5685288 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5685289 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5685290 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5685291 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5685292 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5685293 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5685294 i think that it would be up to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5685295 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5685296 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5685297 needs to give the pro life and the values voters a reason to be enthusiastic
5685298 people who are not necessarily hard core republicans but who vote republican because of life and marriage they may vote or they may not but they may not bring anybody with them to the polls
5685299 my church teaches and i do believe that human rights begin early in life at conception or shortly thereafter and that is my personal belief
5685300 i dont believe the force of criminal law should compel others to necessarily follow that to the greatest degree
5685301 we shouldnt criminalize the health care decisions of doctors and women to fight abortion
5685302 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5685303 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season

5685306 within a second it can take a measurement and tell you whether or not its cancer
5685307 and you can move the probe around quickly to different spots of the skin
5685308 it can tell if the structures of the cells and the biochemicals present are associated with the progression of these cancers
5685309 many biopsies and surgeries would be unnecessary if you had a device that could catch the cancer earlier and identify the margins of where it exists
5685310 the objective of the diagnosis and management of rhinitis an updated practice parameter is to improve the care of patients with all types of rhinitis with an emphasis on allergic rhinitis
5685311 following a thorough review of the medical literature the evidence was incorporated into this guideline thereby providing the practicing allergist an updated practical guide for the diagnosis and management of rhinitis
5685312 in recent years clinical research has significantly increased our knowledge about rhinitis treatments and new treatments have been introduced therefore an updated parameter was needed to provide new guidance for optimal rhinitis treatment

5685317 muslims should fulfill jihad with the heart tongue and hand muslims use the heart in their struggle to resist evil the tongue may convince others to take up worthy causes such as funding medical research hands may perform good works and correct wrongs
5685318 traditionally in islamic countries women are not expected to read or write today muslim women are pursuing educations and new career opportunities while islamists call for a return to tradition many muslims embrace a mixture of traditional and modern ways
5685319 they are very conscious of their identity they know who they are and what they are and what they want a quality which we seem to have lost to a very large extent this is a source of strength in the one of weakness in the other
5685320 there has been some decline in foreign reserves and outflow of bank deposits since the outbreak of the conflict though the outflow of deposits slowed towards the end of last week but it remains too early to judge how severe has been the impact on the real economy and the risk of further military and political conflict remains
5685321 the impact of the conflict on the economy will be an important driver of future sovereign rating actions
5685322 russian forces remain in control of key georgian towns and cities outside of the separatist regions maintaining a stranglehold over the georgian economy
5685323 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5685324 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5685325 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5685326 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5685327 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5685328 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5685329 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5685330 our goal is to help everyone in these challenging times by offering free classified ads to sell items that are no longer wanted

5685333 indias number one davis cupper leander paes informed anil khanna executive vice president and secretary general in a meeting held in beijing just after the tennis event that he would like to step down as captain of the indian davis cup team for the tie against romania
5685334 he wanted the best davis cup team to represent the nation and did not want to leave any doubt in anyones mind for their non participation to represent the country in the biggest team event
5685335 somdev has been picked on the basis of his recent performance leander and mahesh being our best doubles players picked themselves into the squad but rohan has not been selected because prakash and somdev are in better form and are ranked higher than him
5685336 of course rohan is more experienced but somdev is in great form and we thought he would be a better choice current form and performance were the only criteria while selecting the team
5685337 this man has taken the joy away from playing the davis cup
5685338 the goal is not to capture the entire upside of asia but to provide a more stable profile that investors can stay with over time
5685339 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
5685340 i believe hell keep the country safe and exercise good judgment so im going to vote for him
5685341 married women with two children who are members of womens groups
5685342 im going to raise taxes but im going to cut taxes
5685343 china and beijing welcome the friends from all over the world and hope they enjoy the time here
5685344 just really anxious to know about america and where were from and what our experience has been here in china so far
5685345 particularly the transport system its so easy to get about its working well for us and lots of restaurants very clean so really really enjoying it
5685346 yes its a wonderful city weve traveled quite a bit but this is quite an experience
5685347 so i think the olympic games may be the best thing to beijing even more china
5685348 they cant go to look and maybe they have to move from their small houses and so on
5685349 everything you see on tv sometimes can be a little bit negative but when you come over here you see more of the positive side of things
5685350 and you tend to forget about some of the negative things which i guess we shouldnt in retrospect but youre here at the olympics so youre really meant to worry about the political stuff away from the olympics and just enjoy it for what it is and enjoy the friendship of the people
5685351 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5685352 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
5685353 we didnt have any guns so he shot georgi in front of me without saying a word
5685354 a neighbour helped me to bury him in our garden and then i just fled
5685355 if they are not staying here why did they blow up our tv centre and bring their transmitters to broadcast their own tv and radio it looks very suspicious
5685356 it is a matter of fact that they have expanded geographically since yesterday
5685357 we feel legally bound to the commitment to cease fire that we have made but it looks like they dont feel committed to this agreement after the ceasefire they exploded the bridge and went deeper into our territory they have cut the country in two
5685358 we have two options either we attack them to get into the city or obey the rules that they impose they say that the moment they see any georgian police cars in the city they will shoot
5685359 they organise lines and tell us to come at a particular time but then they have nothing to give us there are men walking away with aid boxes and we get nothing they are also coming to peoples homes and looking for humanitarian aid to take back so that they can start selling it on the streets
5685360 i think they will ask for some concessions and will be bargaining hard thats why they are taking as many places as they can now
5685361 gold star registry makes it possible to obtain the tools that will help students learn while also making it easy for parents and communities to provide meaningful support to their local teachers
5685362 while donations from parents or the parent teacher association are always appreciated the items they give may not always align with our most pressing learning need
5685363 in many districts school budgets simply cannot cover the cost of all the classroom supplies needed teachers committed to creating an attractive learning environment and providing the additional tools to help their students learn are buying the extras with their own money our registry enables teachers to get what they need without putting further strain on their own budget or that of the district it effectively widens the circle of support for schools
5685364 although we appreciate the sentiment many of us simply dont need another gift of a coffee mug
5685365 not in this country better to just ignore the problem and hope it will die out all on its own
5685366 we cant talk honestly about native issues balbulican and individuals with attitudes such as your own are the reason for that
5685367 inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill
5685368 were the necessary tools of their trade possessed to be used in furtherance of that violent cause
5685369 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5685382 in many respects khan muhammad and munshi were facilitators they had the knowledge required to orchestrate terrorist acts and they willingly shared that expertise with others these are not the actions of curious individuals or even those who are sympathetic to terrorist objectives
5685383 they are the actions of people who pose a very real threat to our communities
5685384 had the city provided demonstrators a proper forum to express dissent with the war in iraq like the great lawn in central park which organizers had requested as a meeting place but which the city ruled off limits that would have kept many of them off the streets the least the city can do now is to lift the secrecy surrounding its actions

5685413 direct dangerous and provocative interference in the internal affairs of the khalsa panth and attempts to destroy the mini parliament of the sikhs the shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee through the setting up of parallel body in haryana
5685414 endangering peace and communal harmony in the region and the country by hatching a conspiracy to undo countless sacrifices made by the sikhs for the right to manage their own holy shrines
5685415 the ultimate democratic symbol of glory of the panth and of its right to manage its own religious shrines
5685416 that spate of violence itself was the result of the dangerous political conspiracies of the then congress leaders at the centre and in the state it seems they are hell bent on reactivating those conspiracies
5685417 the long and glorious struggle that led to the formation of the sgpc in 1925
5685418 the saga was described by no less a leader than mahatma gandhi as the first victory in the movement for independence later the then prime minister pandit jawahar lal nehru reached a pact with the panth ratan master tara singh ji on non interference in the religious affairs of the sikhs the pact known as nehru master tara singh pact specifically and categorically said that no decision affecting the religious affairs of the sikh community would be taken except through the prior consent of the overwhelming majority of the members of the sgpc
5685419 sonia gandhi for some intriguing reason is bent upon making a mockery even of that sacred pledge made by her grand father in law to the sikh community
5685420 or else she would be directly responsible for any unpleasant consequences that flow from her pursuing this disastrous course

5685472 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them

5685475 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5685476 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country

5685485 the difficulty with this calf in our view is that it probably hasnt weaned itself from its mother and that is why it is taking to yachts the prognosis isnt good
5685486 its heart wrenching but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5685487 its like communism to allow free access to this place
5685488 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5685489 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5685490 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5685491 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5685492 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq

5685513 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5685514 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5685515 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5685516 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5685517 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5685518 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5685519 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5685520 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5685521 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5685522 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5685523 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5685524 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5685525 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5685526 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5685527 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5685528 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5685529 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5685530 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5685531 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5685532 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5685533 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5685555 i am directing this year so thats a totally new beast to tackle
5685556 so im looking at the show in a very different way also theres something so wonderful about the family that weve built so coming back just doesnt feel like i am coming back to work on smallville it really feels like i am coming home in a lot of ways its really nice to come back and enjoy that kind of fall into the warm embrace of the family thats being built there
5685557 what i mean is that as an actor its my job to make everything interesting and exciting and new and if i am not doing my job well then i am stealing
5685558 so coming back i think its important to keep it fresh and its important to be excited because i think thats part of why i get paid
5685559 i dont have the script and i have no idea what its going to look like other then its not going to have a lot of chloe in it
5685560 i followed around a couple of directors and was there every day sitting in the chair just asking questions and writing things down
5685561 now that its been confirmed again i come in and i have my directing homework and i go over it with james marshall marizee almas whos our first assistant director and glen winter whos a director of photography im trying to learn as much as i can its amazing making a tv show is incredible the things that go into it and the amount of work oh my god its amazing
5685562 and i love film so much and i love the whole process of making film this is just sort of the next step of understanding it on a deeper level i always want to be telling stories in whatever fashion i can and directing is really just understanding learning a different element of that storytelling process
5685563 i dont know shes really diving head first into the isis and shes really taking on the job of being the mentor and the kind of place of solace for all the meteor infected so i think that thats really going to see her be focused and shes pretty angry at lex luthor so shes going to stay as far away from him and his cohorts as possible
5685564 its time for him to grow up a little bit and not rely on chloe so much so that chloe can go off and forge her own path
5685565 shes been his shadow for a really long time and while she has been doing things of great importance i think its really exciting to see her start to see her kind of forge her own way and figure out what shes passionate about separate and aside from clark you really start to see her do that at the isis foundation and shes really narrowing down her scope of what she wants to focus on which is really to try and help that part of the population in the world and i think thats really cool
5685566 i think chloe is really taking on the whole mother teresa kind of thing thats been looming around since she started her superpower of healing a couple of season ago
5685567 shes got such a huge heart and she is recognizing that there are more people that need her other than clark kent which is another reason i think she sort of starting to cut the apron strings and let clark venture into his own sort of thing cause she is really seeing how many people need her help and bette is just the first of i think many
5685568 aka doomsday and as always clark kent chloe has her hands full when it comes to the men in her life
5685569 i know i have such a stable to choose from now its really so horrible
5685570 obviously my relationship with clark is still going strong and were kind of always trying to find our footing and figure out if were in love or just friends or whats going on then shes got jimmy whos just this beautiful amazing supportive stable realistic man who i think she really seeks to find solace in and kind of use this as a way to ground herself in some sort of sense of stability so she goes to him a lot when things feel kind of crazy but now she has this new hero paramedic davis guy whos pursuing her pretty actively is incredibly attractive and very kind and interesting and also a little dark so shes really got three to choose from and you know there is always the green arrow and hes just fun to play with
5685571 im learning more and more about the comics as we go cause i dont know a lot about the superman comics so just finding out a couple of weeks ago that doomsday actually kills superman in the comics and being a part of the struggle between the dark and the light side again i think is really exciting so im really looking forward to it and sam witwer is a wonderful actor and hes so charming so im having a lot of fun playing with him
5685572 my part as this character has not been anything secure
5685573 so weve really been able to work in quite an equal partnership the writers myself and the fans in shaping who this character is going to be and shaping the direction she is going to go so i really like the fact that everything is new and that were really molding a brand new character together
5685574 what an amazing honor to have a character written after you
5685575 i think that its so cool so i am thrilled at that opportunity and that possibility and i hope to see it come to fruition i mean who gets to show their kids like this is me this is a character i built and thats awesome
5685576 were like a train we just keep going forging ahead and we miss them dearly and we love them and we talk about them and think about them all the time but you know we are making a show so we cant slow down
5685577 well see that bald head again hes not gone for good
5685578 john glover said to me once that a good part is a good part no matter what the venue and i go where the good parts are
5685579 ive always had so much respect for him and his career and his choices as an actor i think hes just amazing so i would like to stay doing that and really listen to him and follow in his footsteps in that respect
5685580 we soon realized that this story was too big for one movie
5685581 so we teamed up with jon and our good friend stephen christy over at devils due to serialize the story and make it a comic series eventually stephen pitched the thing from memory to abc family and they liked it as much as we do and the rest is so on and so forth
5685582 the needs and demands of comic books arent always the same as the needs of television or film so im having fun addressing the concerns of both media at the same time i hope to reconcile the two well enough so that the tv show looks like the comic and the comic looks like the tv show
5685583 got no strings to hold him down to make him fret or make him frown

5685588 while the immediate consequences of nixons outrageous behavior were jail sentences for several conservative republicans and the election of a bumper crop of liberals to congress in 1974 watergate permanently poisoned public attitudes toward government and stirred up the wave that swept ronald reagan into office six years later and made antigovernment cynicism the default american political sentiment

5685682 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5685683 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5685684 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5685685 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5685686 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5685687 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5685688 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5685689 its not a matter of party its a matter of ideals and policy
5685690 it means the world to me to retain the armband
5685691 johns big personality is why i chose him but rio is also important for the team which is why i made him vice captain
5685692 hes captain of the french team as long as pat isnt there
5685693 weve seen various people have had injury problems over recent seasons im not committing to anything
5685694 theres a new generation but there always has to be someone to show the way

5685705 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5685706 so at the moment im sort of frustrated i have been frustrated by what has happened this year
5685707 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5685708 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5685709 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5685710 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5685711 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5685712 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5685713 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5685714 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5685715 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5685716 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5685717 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that

5685829 by working together to develop biomarker panels we hope to identify toxic liabilities much earlier in the drug development process than currently exists in the marketplace our ultimate goal is to enable mtpc to prioritize its lead drug series
5685830 the university of michigan peptides have unique characteristics that we believe play an important role in improving the efficacy of delivery of rnai based therapeutics
5685831 these cationic peptides have the potential of being critical components of rnai based therapeutic formulations we are currently using these peptides to create sirna nanoparticles to enhance gene expression knockdown together with the dila 2 platform of novel delivery lipids these delivery peptides improve the therapeutic potential of our drug candidates
5685832 the science of nanopores is complex and challenging we are very proud to have gathered a world class panel of experts from leading institutions in this field
5685833 our relationships with the advisory board members extend beyond pure technical advice our support of research in the laboratories will further the science of nanopores oxford nanopore now has the worlds best advisors and an excellent in house development team of scientists and engineers we are in a unique position to develop an early to market sequencing technology and improved versions in the future a label free approach to dna sequencing would facilitate a transformation in genomics that could be likened to the broadband revolution
5685834 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5685835 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5685836 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5685837 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5685838 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5685839 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5685840 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
5685841 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
5685842 receptorbio is very enthusiastic about gaining the opportunity to continue the development of the insulin receptor activator compounds discovered by telik
5685843 these compounds have a unique mechanism of action directed against a validated drug target the insulin receptor and thus they represent a novel class of insulin sensitizers
5685844 the oral agents currently available on the market for the treatment of t2d are limited and may be associated with undesirable side effects
5685845 a drug that acts by targeting and activating the insulin receptor should provide a novel treatment for this disease both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs that have complimentary mechanisms of action
5685846 studies with the research team at the molecular pathogenesis unit surgical neurology branch ninds identified a biomarker that appears to be preferentially targeted by novel anti cancer drugs currently being evaluated by ninds and lixte as new treatments for human brain tumors molecular studies revealed that these drugs alter the state of this biomarker in a way that leads to the death of cancer cells since the biomarker appears to be important to the survival of several human cancers in addition to brain cancers studies will be done to determine the effectiveness of targeting the biomarker in other tumor types and as a guide to drug discovery of new anti cancer compounds
5685847 parkinsons disease is a devastating illness for those patients whose symptoms are no longer well controlled by medication alone

5685851 the whole idea of being independent has its pluses and its minuses whatever it takes to make great games so with us or with valve thats just the reality of the industry
5685852 there are going to be a ton of acquisitions and mergers in the future and its going to continue until there are very few left thats probably the way its going to go
5685853 sks independence is important to a certain degree but its not the be all and end all
5685854 its funny because weve been an independent developer longer than most in the industry

5685860 in our correctional facilities inmates typically outnumber officers by a ratio of seven to one or more and most correctional officers walk their beat armed only with a radio a baton and their considerable people skills

5685867 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5685868 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5685869 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5685870 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5685871 sites like twitter and facebook will never make much money from advertising social media users are too busy being social to pay attention to ads

5685926 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5685927 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5685928 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5685929 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5685930 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5685931 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5685932 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5685933 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5685934 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5685935 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5685936 the thing i dont think people understand and i truly mean and thats from day one ive prepared and gone about it as if this would come through now i just have to go out the thing thats so nice for me personally and everybody is different im just progressing each year and each year and now im ready to take the next step
5685937 i wasnt surprised but you never really know all i can do is worry about what i can control and that was going out and practicing hard every day and continuing to do the same thing
5685938 its important it really is i think they realize how genuine i am and the fact that all i want to do is win i heard
5685939 i think any tough time is going to make you a better player or person or whatever the case may be just in talking to some other people who are in similar situations the quarterback position is often magnified or whatever it may be theres a lot of positions where these sort of situations are going on me being religious and a lot of guys on this team being religious you have to believe god has a plan for you thats what faith is when things dont necessarily seem like theyre going to work out in your favor its having faith and believing that they will i think this is a perfect example of that

5685998 do 254 certifiable ip is a huge productivity gain for our customers who have to comply with the do 254 standard

5686001 working with altera on do 254 certifiable ip is the next step for us in supporting the needs of this market
5686002 mentor recognized the importance of do 254 at its inception and has been investing in solutions for do 254 certification for several years this initiative lets us leverage both our methodology expertise and tools to not only provide the industry with high quality ip but also the tool and methodology guidance that many are seeking

5686182 woodard pens tales instantly recognizable for theyre american stories weve all lived and shared with the album holding a mirror to us all
5686183 the absolute highlight of this album is reno the duet with nickel creeks sara watkins this is one of the most traditional country sounding songs on the album and woodards voice works with watkins so well youd think theyve been singing together for years
5686184 cool folk melancholy sounds especially fine next to gleaming country pop guitars

5686220 i fulfilled my dream and it means more to me than anything
5686221 to say that i have five medals at my first olympic games means the world to me
5686222 and just having one gold is ok because it team is the one that means the most
5686223 i used the highest level of difficulty and this is the first time ive used it in a competition
5686224 i was very nervous but i had already won two gold medals team floor in these olympic games so my psychological state was much better than my competitors
5686225 dan maakt het helemaal niet meer uit welke besturingssystemen het bedrijf en de klanten gebruiken iets wat microsoft koste wat het kost tegen probeert te houden want dat gaat zeker ten koste van het marktaandeel
5686226 alle argumenten komen voort uit 1 punt vendor lock in bedrijven hebben zich compleet aangepast aan microsoft zodat microsoft kan maken wat het wil het bedrijfsleven m et wel mee
5686227 met dezelfde redenen kan je vertellen waarom apple niet kan worden gekozen en in beide gevallen is er een grondreden microsoft heeft ieder bedrijf in de wereld ok dat is wat gechargeerd in de wurggreep door iedereen gebruik te laten maken van gesloten standaarden
5686228 gebrek aan programmas zoek eens zelf met twintigduizend applicaties moet je iets passends kunnen vinden linux is geen windows gelukkig niet zou ik zo zeggen
5686229 voor elk van de genoemde pakketten outlook access photoshop zijn er gelijkwaardige zo niet betere alternatieven verkrijgbaar
5686230 geen microsoft excel hoewel er goede spreadsheetsoftware is voor linux is het geen excel en financi le mensen willen per s met excel werken ze hebben meestal enorme modellen met veel vba scripts en andere excel specifieke zaken erin
5686231 dit is echt een zogeheten showstopper voor linux op de desktop hierdoor zijn al projecten teruggedraaid of er ontstaan allerlei tussenoplossingen waarbij er voor bepaalde mensen toch weer een windows machine is zodat ze excel kunnen draaien of ze krijgen een virtuele omgeving waarin ze dat kunnen gevolg er moeten twee desktopbesturingsystemen worden ondersteund dus kennis over beiden moet in huis zijn en je hebt maar een beperkte besparing op licenties zo raak je snel het kostenvoordeel kwijt
5686232 en die financi le mensen hebben meestal heel veel invloed op het aankoopbeleid van het bedrijf zorg dus dat je nagaat hoe afhankelijk zij zijn van excel denk niet die zetten we wel even over op openoffice tenzij je je ict carri re snel wilt be indigen
5686233 ondanks dat linux perfect zou zijn voor de zakelijke desktopmarkt is het maar de vraag of bedrijven de omschakeling willen maken met name het office pakket is voor kantoorlui erg belangrijk want klanten gebruiken het ook zelf gebruik ik priv open office op linux en zakelijk office 2007 op vista klanten kunnen door mij toegestuurde bestanden vaak niet lezen omdat ze negen van de tien keer een ouder office pakket hebben dat mijn bestanden niet goed kan lezen met name spreadsheets zijn een groot probleem hoewel beide pakketten de mogelijkheid hebben om het bestand goed op te slaan mist men altijd dingen als macros en opmaak
5686234 dus tenzij er alleen nog maar vaste open standaarden worden gebruikt voor bestanden is het bijna onmogelijk om zeker op de zakelijke markt een ander besturingssysteem te gebruiken dan opdrachtgevers en opdrachtnemers
5686235 photoshop werkt wel degelijk en volledig via wine dat mag best even toegevoegd worden
5686236 precies de reden waarom je dergelijke software links moeten laten liggen maak gebruik van echte open standaarden open source een websiteapplicatie die daar afhankelijk van is kan bij de volgende versie van m icrosoft ook weleens niet werken en mocht je toch die ene applicatie missen dan gebruik je toch crossover of wine op je linux machine
5686237 vriendjes rustig maar op de redactie weet men heus wel van ieder bekend windows programma een linux prog te noemen dat min of meer als vervanging zou kunnen gelden dat staat ook in het artikel daarnaast is gimp geen vervanging van photoshop voor de serieuze gebruiker als je de redenen daarvan niet snapt ben je geen dtp er
5686238 zeer veel bedrijven hebben zich ingezet om het applicatielandschap onder linux fors uit te breiden en dat gaat nog wel even zo door kijkend naar kantoortoepassingen denk ik dat er inderdaad veel te besparen is met open soure linux op de desktop tel maar eens op wat je anders kwijt bent aan licenties
5686239 ik werk als bedrijf al jaren op een linux desktop voor de genoemde m applicaties zijn volwaardige tegenhangers op linux
5686240 het op peil houden van microsoft kennis is ook geen goedkope hobby
5686241 ook de mensen met ms kennis houd je niet binnen de deur en wat ervoor terugkomt mag je weer opnieuw opleiden omdat die net weer voor een andere versie zijn gecertificeerd
5686242 het is in tegenstelling tot windows uit zichzelf stabiel het wordt niet langzamer na twee jaar gebruik en voor virussen trojans rootkits heb je bij linux geen tijd nodig
5686243 de meeste argumenten hier zijn ook heel oud geen nieuws en de meeste zijn allang niet actueel meer
5686244 het altijd maar vinger wijzen naar microsoft vind ik kinderachtig en aantoonbaar kortzichtig het grootste probleem is denk ik de linux community zelf waar te veel aanbieders strijden om gebruikersgroepen die klein zijn in vergeleken met windows
5686245 als die aanbieders nou meer de handen ineen slaan om de gui en de applicatiecompatibiliteit te verhogen kan linux grote stappen gaan maken ik merk namelijk dat de bereidheid om over te stappen vaak wel aanwezig is en voor een thuisgebruiker betekent tco vrijwel niks
5686246 bij een bedrijf waar ik werkte was ook een opensource en linux fan al zijn suggesties die zijn aangenomen hebben uiteindelijk veel meer geld gekost dan dat het opleverde dat was niet eenmalig onderhoud koste veel tijd terwijl dat in windows vaak automatisch ging ik heb veel tijd gestopt in linux in mijn eigen tijd en in mijn zaken tijd en ik zou het alleen aanraden aan mensen met weinig geld en veel vrije tijd
5686247 ik vind het jammer dat linux fans vaak met allerlei suggesties en alternatieven komen aanzetten die alle problemen oplossen maar dat je dan in de praktijk dagen bezig bent omdat het niet zo werkt als je was verteld
5686248 oh je gebruikt die distributie dan moet je even op site a dit downloaden en compileren met programma b daarna als sudo dit configuratiebestand editen etcetera
5686249 het grote boze microsoft is zo populair omdat het een onderhoudsvriendelijke consistente omgeving biedt met een lage leerdrempel linux fans buigen hun eigen kortzichtigheid vaak om in die van de microsoft gebruiker
5686250 maar geen enkele van deze punten is volledig geldig voor elk punt is er ook een windows oplossing behalve voor punt 1
5686251 maar goed we zullen het maar niet hebben over de mindere support op linux waardoor je tco nog altijd minimaal even hoog ligt
5686252 de overgang naar een linux desktop gaat nou eenmaal niet vlekkeloos ja er wordt aan gewerkt maar op dit moment is het gewoon nog niet interessant microsoft heeft op dit moment een grotere applicatiebasis en linux nog niet zolang dat nog niet wijzigt zal niemand snel overstappen
5686253 alle migraties gaan niet vanzelf en overstappen van windows naar een andere windows levert al bergen issues en compatibiliteitsproblemen op linux is zeker wel gewoon wat meer werk maar het is zeer zeker mogelijk normale kantoortaken zijn geen probleem uitgezonderd als je ms access nodig hebt
5686254 verder is linux veel beter te beveiligen op dat punt heeft linux veel meer en de betere kaarten in huis gisteren nog een test gedaan met een rdp sessie terminal services remote desktopje naar windows 2003 server onder een liveversie van ubuntu dat werkte allemaal gewoon n lekker rap
5686255 die hoef je niet aan te schaffen in tegenstelling tot bij windows dat geld kun je dus weer aan training en dergelijke uitgeven
5686256 dat levert altijd weer problemen op met het uitzoeken daarvan
5686257 leuk speeltje voor de techneuten maar niet voor de gemiddelde gebruiker die interesseert het niets of het gratis is of niet die wil gewoon alles kunnen doen en zover is het nog niet op de linux desktop
5686258 we moeten softwareschrijvers dwingen ook te schrijven voor linux als het roer hierin een beetje om zou gaan dan moeten anderen ook wel nu schrijft men software en gaat er vanuit dat het voor windows is zou de markt 50 50 zijn dan wordt het een heel ander verhaal en zou men alle draagbare gadgets en andere randapparatuur ook veel beter ondersteunen
5686259 voor de installed base die linux n kent is de hoeveelheid beschikbare applicaties en de beheerbaarheid al rg goed laat staan als de installed base groeit en de vraag vanuit de markt groter wordt
5686260 dit is ook een reden van lik me vestje toegegeven windows werkt vaker en zonder tweaken op meer pcs maar niemand is verplicht windows aan te schaffen op een pc het is een kwestie van de licentie weigeren en dan gewoon linux installeren
5686261 bedrijven dienen gewoon een goede keuze te maken in de distributie en dan volgen de pakketten voor de desktop vanzelf
5686262 verandering van spijs doet eten microsoft software is zo goed omdat mensen het alternatief niet proberen
5686263 de meeste nadelen die in dit artikel genoemd worden hebben totaal geen raakvlak met de werkelijkheid
5686264 overigens ben ik ook geen fanboy ik gebruik microsoft software al jaren maar durf ook over de heg te kijken wat er daar te vinden is en zie steeds meer voordelen in linux en os x tegenover windows voor mij hoeft ook niet alle software open source te zijn zolang er maar gebruik wordt gemaakt van open standaarden
5686265 wat windows linux bsd os x betreft heeft het zin op lange termijn om voor open standaarden te kiezen zodat je in ieder geval zelf kan bepalen welk platform of welke combinaties het beste voor je organisatie werkt wat mij betreft heeft linux maar een grote manco en dat is het feit dat er zoveel distributies zijn die de hele uniformiteit om zeep helpen
5686266 de hier genoemde punten zouden meer waarheid bevatten als je de titel zou hernoemen naar acht redenen om linux niet te gebruiken als je hiermee een windows kloon verwacht linux is geen windows en je moet dus ook niet verwachten daarmee windows namaak binnen te halen
5686267 langzaam maar zeker begint microsoft last te krijgen van linux als besturingssysteem zeker nu het met vista ook niet zo lekker gaat volgens de berichten een negatief stukje schrijven over linux kan de aandacht afleiden van de problemen die microsoft op dit moment heeft linux is al lang niet meer een moeilijk te bedienen besturingssysteem nu nog de hardware fabrikanten overhalen om iets verder over de grens te kijken
5686268 aan alle reageerders jullie snappen volgens mij helemaal niet waar het om gaat in dit artikel dit gaat niet om de reden waarom linux in zn algemeenheid niet te gebruiken maar over de reden waarom linux niet doorbreekt op de desktop wat dat betreft klopt het verhaal wel redelijk alleen de titel is totaal verkeerd die suggereert dat dit een ordinair potje linux bashen is wat dus niet zo blijkt te zijn als je het goed leest
5686269 al ben ik zelf een linux fan kan ik me wel inleven in de schrijver van het artikel er wordt namelijk uitgegaan van de desktopgebruikers die vaak weinig tot geen kennis hebben van computers in het algemeen de argumenten van de linux fans in de vorige reacties ondersteun ik uiteraard volledig maar die zijn meer van toepassing op het serverpark van een bedrijf omdat linux in dit geval veel stabieler is en dus minder geld kost minder onderhoud is het een betere keus
5686270 zelf ben ik v r een hybride netwerk linux servers met windows desktops werkt perfect om zo de stabiliteit te hebben op de servers maar de gebruikersvriendelijkheid lees herkenbaarheid van windows voor de gebruikers te houden
5686271 bij windows moet je langs alle leveranciers waarvan je software of een driver hebt
5686272 het is een losgeslagen bende en zeker niet te vergelijken met een bedrijf als microsoft die mannen maken natuurlijk foutjes maar de code staat ergens voor we kunnen iemand aanspreken en wie moet je bij gratis software nu iets laten uitzoeken
5686273 nu wil ik niet pretenderen dat een eee pc een desktop is en dat er geen probleem is met legacy applicaties het laat wel zien dat een probleemloze desktop zonder meer mogelijk is gebruiksvriendelijk en ook nog eens onderhoudsvriendelijk
5686274 lle programmas worden namelijk met n en hetzelfde beheersysteem package management system onderhouden je wordt dus niet dagelijks geconfronteerd met meerdere programmas die ieder op hun eigen manier hun updates willen installeren ik denk dan ook dat die eeepc er voor gaat zorgen dat linux uiteindelijk zal gaan doorbreken op de desktop maar daar zal nog wel enige tijd overheen gaan

5686398 es una barbaridad que no se festejen las fechas patrias cuando deber an ser
5686399 este tema surgi cuando el gobernador closs en el acto del d a de la bandera en candelaria propuso debatir y analizar las celebraciones de las fechas patrias ahora plasmamos eso en un proyecto de ley para ver si se trata cuanto antes
5686400 el problema que existe con los feriados es que se festeja en los d as en los que no corresponde y m s que nada tiene que ver con la promoci n del turismo por ese lado hay resistencia al proyecto ya que los feriados largos significan mas ingresos para ellos
5686401 la idea ser a que cuando las fechas patrias sean martes o jueves se produzca un puente es decir si por ejemplo la fecha patria cae un jueves que el viernes sea asueto no feriado y de esta manera quedar a zanjeado con el turismo en comisi n se podr an aceptar variaciones y habr a que ver las formas de acomodar las fechas pero siempre respetando los festejos patrios
5686402 en el proyecto no aparece la multimillonaria deuda y para que la empresa vuelva a funcionar como en sus mejores pocas hay que trabajar renovar y cambiar los aviones lo importante es preservar la empresa y los trabajadores que est n muy bien capacitados para realizar el trabajo que hacen lo fundamental es no quebrar la l nea de bandera

5686418 ahora cu ndo una petici n de este tipo puede convertirse en un boomerang para la empresa y contrario a los resultados positivos virales esperados la conversaci n en torno a la marca gira sobre comentarios negativos algunas consideraciones al respecto lo primero es reconocer que para una empresa recurrir al blog marketing ha de despojarse de una serie de viejos paradigmas comenzando por aquel en que la empresa est acostumbrada a controlar todos los procesos con la facilidad de publicaci n de contenidos gracias a m ltiples y gratuitas herramientas en internet como los blogs el control est en manos de prosumidores pro ductores de contenidos con sumidores y por tanto el rol de la empresa es asumir esa realidad siendo lo suficientemente flexible en sus planes para adaptarse a las necesidades de sus clientes consumidores de forma constante si la empresa se empe a en controlar el proceso tiene el gran riesgo de terminar con una comunidad vac a o lo que es peor una reacci n negativa hacia su marca y al final el blog marketing persigue fomentar el sentido de comunidad hacia la marca a trav s de conversaciones sobre ella ya sea en forma de fotos videos textos documentos etc c mo no hacer marketing online

5686475 the five things my attorneys dont want me to talk about in public
5686476 the internext show in florida is always one of my favorite conventions and this year wasnt any different
5686477 the highlight is the fact that everyone is congregated in one location within the lovely diplomat hotel so the opportunity to run into someone that could be beneficial to your business occurs with high frequency
5686478 this years internext was one of the most beneficial networking conventions that i have personally attended
5686479 i gained so much valuable information that will really help us with our web presence with my companys new websites digitalplayground com and piratesxxx com

5686904 could not god make people perfect right at the beginning someone may ask take the example of a very small child the mother can give her baby grown up food but the baby is still unable to take adult nourishment similarly god could have given humanity perfection right at the beginning but humanity could not have received it because it was only a child for that reason our lord who sums up all things in himself when he came on earth in these last days came not in the full glory which he could have done but in a form we could see certainly he could have come in his imperishable glory but we should not have been able to bear the greatness of his majesty therefore like giving milk to infants the perfect bread of the father revealed himself to us on earth in human form so that we might be nourished by his word like babes at the breast and so by degrees become strong enough to digest the whole word of god

5687022 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5687023 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5687024 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land

5687046 the russian military said monday that it had begun pulling back troops that had swarmed into the nation of georgia last week but us and georgian officials and news reports indicated that at least initially little had changed on the ground
5687047 despite pledges russia shows no signs of pullout from georgia
5687048 russian soldiers continued digging in to positions along the highway approaching the capital tbilisi showing no sign of pulling back from the severest confrontation between russia and the west since the collapse of the soviet union
5687049 the russian military operated with impunity as its forces moved convoys in and out of the city of gori and plowed through a police roadblock in this town some 25 miles northwest of tbilisi
5687050 this is what the russian withdrawal looked like today armored vehicles tossing georgian police cars out of their path and new russian checkpoints dotting the landscape
5687051 the russians made clear they are going to take their own sweet time pulling out russian troops still control a number of georgian cities and by nightfall us intelligence had detected no significant withdrawals
5687052 in gori where russian troops remained in full control the sometimes demeaning aspects of occupation were on display during an impromptu news conference conducted monday by david kalekashvili georgias state minister for regional development the russians have to keep their promises this is a never ending story and there is not a single sign that they will begin the withdrawal as they said they would kalekashvili shouted his face reddening
5687053 arrived in brussels monday for crisis talks with nato allies on georgia
5687054 the ministers also would reaffirm natos support for former soviet bloc nations like poland and the baltic states though now alliance members those nations have been deeply unsettled by what they saw as a tepid western response to a major step by moscow to reassert its influence over its former empire
5687055 was very forceful and actually extremely blunt on the subject of georgia in terms of the russian withdrawal she said it didnt take russian forces that long to get into georgia it shouldnt take them that long to get out
5687056 said the united states and its allies would not allow russia to draw a new line through europe and intimidate former soviet republics and former satellite states
5687057 it is playing a very dangerous game by resuming cold war era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast
5687058 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5687059 natos 26 foreign ministers are determined to present a united front on tuesday in expressing continued support for georgias ultimate membership of the western alliance and insisting that russian troops complete a full withdrawal from georgian territory outside south ossetia and abkhazia
5687060 signing a missile defense deal with its good friend the united states has earned poland nothing less than the threat of nuclear attack from russia a threat that might not sound so empty these days given moscows bloody battle with georgia
5687061 russias strident objections to the deal between the united states and poland on a missile defense system are largely unfounded thats the view of american officials and analysts who say moscows aim in the controversy is to divide nato and drive a wedge between the us and its allies
5687062 house and senate leaders should invite georgian president mikheil saakashvili to address a joint session of congress according to bipartisan members of the congressional georgia caucus

5687109 we are pleased that our two new acquisitions as well as strong organic growth at kids line and sassy drove top line growth in our infant amp juvenile segment in the second quarter of 2008 however we recognize there are cost increases as well as pricing and consumer challenges within these businesses and we are focused on implementing appropriate strategies for each of them to continue growing both market share and profits we completed the initial phase of integrating lajobi and cocalo after acquiring both companies early in the second quarter and each was accretive to our results in the quarter overall we are rigorously focused on offsetting higher costs through various price optimization and cost management measures maximizing sales opportunities across all four businesses and strategically executing our international expansion strategy we are confident we have the right business model to continue advancing our leadership position in this attractive industry that has favorable demographic trends recession resistant products and little seasonality

5687480 the people who they claim have certified their machines have no knowledge of architecture whatsoever
5687481 the fundamental structures that diebold has used to set up their voting machines are inherently flawed they are what i would consider it junk
5687482 those people the people who check a banks atm are not from diebold one of them is from the installation group and one of them is from the bank otherwise the atm machine is not certified for use
5687483 so what youre saying is theres more security regarding the dispensing of a 20 bill and the fact that if you dont get that 20 bill there is more of an audit system set up as compared to any audit system for the counting of our votes
5687484 there is a very strong argument to be made that the 2000 election was electronically stolen the hanging chads were just a distraction
5687485 warning that the way diebold systems are architected in the way the tabulators communicate to the central state tabulation center is subject to foreign national hacking as well as hacking from within the u s they put out a warning about it to the best of my knowledge this is still the case
5687486 if you look at the case of saxby chambliss thats ridiculous the man was not elected he lost that election by five points max cleland won they flipped the votes clear as day
5687487 i do not believe george bush won in 2004 i believe kerry won and im a member of the gop but i want to make it clear we need to live in a place where your a candidates election actually is reflected in the vote i want my candidate to win but if my candidate loses i care a lot more about the process than i care about the victory
5687488 ive personally reviewed a number of pieces of code from diebold its garbage some of the code is awful i reviewed the patch that they put in georgia 2002 that many of them claimed is a clock function its not a clock function its a comparator function if it were me and i were to guess what that code is its a vote flipping code its not a clock function that i know
5687489 there are people out there and there is sic a lot of them who dont really want to win elections what they want to do is they want to steal them i dont want to have a society where were not sure who won i want to live in a democracy where there is a valid capacity to audit the entire trail
5687490 i think they the diebold machines are brilliantly designed theyre designed to steal elections there are back doors in the tabulations machines which is what the us cert warning is about theres a backdoor communication that allows secondary computers to talk to the actual tabulators electronically from a distance

5687502 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5687503 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5687504 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5687505 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5687506 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5687507 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5687508 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5687509 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5687510 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5687511 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
5687512 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
5687513 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
5687514 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
5687515 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
5687516 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
5687517 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
5687518 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
5687519 predict whether the 2008 congress will break the record number of jewish legislators that was established in the 2006 election cycle
5687520 conduct that may be penalized under the tra and or prohibited under the ear includes
5687521 the us government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted at israel
5687522 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
5687523 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced
5687524 if a product contained even some components that were made in israel and you wanted to import it to dubai it would be a problem
5687525 is used by customs to confirm the country of origin and needs to be seen by the office which ensures any trade boycotts are enforced
5687526 failed to report in a timely manner its receipts of requests from dubai
5687527 they have their boys in there its time to start putting ours in
5687528 cant go to war with iran without getting approval from congress
5687529 and then the astounding thing is when asked why she said the leadership in israel asked her to that was in the newspaper that was in the washington post that she was asked by aipac and others not to do that
5687530 the land without a people for a people without a land

5687547 maybe that persuaded him the manager gave me a big boost by giving me the armband
5687548 i played well and scored the goal and it helped remove a small bit of the heartache
5687549 there are obviously two educations one should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live
5687550 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
5687551 time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils
5687552 the education of the will is the object of our existence
5687553 at college age you can tell who is best at taking tests and going to school but you cant tell who the best people are that worries the hell out of me
5687554 a child educated only at school is an uneducated child
5687555 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5687556 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5687557 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5687558 okay so everyone index fingers ready place them next to your eyes and pull back to your ears where the sun dont shine harder harder goooood

5687586 russian troops will have to withdraw now to their pre crisis positions
5687587 the report indicates a true reflection of the apprehensions and concerns that young teenagers experience during their adolescents in school it reflects their greatest day to day worries and also reflects on the way their maturity will develop throughout their life at school
5687588 with the bulk of some 100 billion in tax rebates now deposited in american consumers bank accounts the hoped for boost in spending has proved disappointing for the nations retailers
5687589 we expected that as the checks fade so would sales
5687590 consumers are filling up their suvs their home equity values are plummeting and theyre feeling a lot of pressures
5687591 were continuing to see a divergence here in where the retail dollars are flowing
5687592 they really seem to be flowing into the nondiscretionary areas like drugstores food and gasoline and its really coming at the expense of some of these retailers such as apparel and electronics and appliances
5687593 we think that when the stimulus checks end which is this quarter were going to hit an air pocket and disposable income will take a negative hit relative to what we saw in the second quarter
5687594 pretty complimentary review and ive been spotting a lot of positive things being written about bands with a similar angle and i think thats pretty cool because i generally like this kind of music
5687595 i dont make experimental music i do the experiments first then i write the music
5687596 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling
5687597 home prices will drop for quite a while maybe several years
5687598 price declines lead to more defaults which leads to more price declines
5687599 time will break the cycle pricing will drop enough to attract more buyers and inventories will decline
5687600 why do all these people want to speak to me
5687601 i was miss nobody and nobody wanted to speak to me and now its overwhelming that everybody does
5687602 if you dont know where youre going youll wind up somewhere else
5687603 banks losses from the u s subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types
5687604 i am concerned that there may be other victims who have not reported the matter i would urge them or anyone who may have information relating to this man to come forward
5687605 the day promises to be a tough test for all those taking part but it also offers the opportunity for the community to meet police officers in a different setting

5687626 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5687627 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5687628 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5687629 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place
5687630 so far its going good we have power and everything

5687645 herr niebel redet dummes zeug denn eine vorverlegung der bundestagswahl auf den 7 juni 2009 ist verfassungswidrig
5687646 offenbar hofft herr niebel diese zahlen zu steigern wenn die fdp im wahlkampf m glichst wenig ber europa reden muss
5687647 denkbar schlecht geeignet weil bei einer zusammenlegung mit der bundestagswahl europ ische fragen unter die r der zu geraten drohen

5687672 when the toll was operated by national toll rolls the charge included 21 vat which was reclaimable by those registered for vat
5687673 this is in effect an increase of 21 in the toll for commercial operators who use the m50 and the extra cost is likely to be passed on to the consumer in the form of increased charges for goods and services
5687674 between 25 000 and 30 000 commercial vehicles use the bridge every day and the small firms association has estimated that the change in the vat arrangements will cost commercial firms close to 4m per year
5687675 both commercial operators and private motorists will also face additional administration charges by having to maintain tag accounts and of course even higher charges if tags are not acquired

5687682 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
5687683 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
5687684 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
5687685 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
5687686 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
5687687 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5687688 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5687689 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5687690 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5687691 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5687692 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5687693 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
5687694 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre

5687700 the primary reason why things are better in iraq today is because of the political negotiations with the sunnis and the shiites which has brought them out of the equation and it has improved the situation markedly
5687701 you could double the number of troops in iraq but wed be no closer to a lasting iraqi political solution the security gains are tenuous at best without political solutions in iraq

5687705 which i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class but thats reflected in his policies where you know for people making more than 2 5 million hes giving folks a 500 000 tax break and so this is a fundamental difference in this election what ive said is were gonna give 95 of working families a tax break but its gonna be ordinary folks
5687706 if you are just talking about income how about 5 million

5688061 scientists have discovered a previously unknown molecular signaling pathway in body fat cells that normally acts to suppress harmful inflammation cellular stress caused by obesity however can override this protective function and convert the pathway into a trigger of chronic inflammation that raises the risk of insulin resistance diabetes and other metabolic disorders researchers from the harvard school of public health hsph said they have shown for the first time that fat storing cells or adipocytes contain a protective anti inflammatory immune mechanism that prevents the cells from over reacting to inflammation causing stimuli such as fatty acids in the diet this signaling pathway serves as a natural counterbalance to a parallel signaling chain that promotes inflammation and can lead to insulin resistance a prelude to diabetes and other ailments such as heart disease said the authors chih hao lee assistant professor of genetics and complex diseases at hsph was the senior author kihwa kang research fellow in the hsph department of genetics and complex diseases was first author

5688085 there are many reasons why informed consumers are avoid consuming cows milk today such as the fact that milk increases stagnation and can promote sinusitis and asthma there are humanitarian and ethical reasons too avoiding milk means not condoning the abuse of dairy cows on conventional dairy farms but one of the most important reasons to consider avoiding the consumption of milk is the waste of water resources that go into its production it can take up to 7 570 litres of water to produce 3 78 litres of milk the cow needs water to perform basic biological functions from day to day and only a fraction of the water the cow consumes is actually converted into milk the fact that it takes so much water to produce cows milk means that anytime you or any consumer chooses to drink milk the burden you place on the natural environment is a thousand times greater than if you were to consume water itself drinking one gallon of milk is like pouring 1 999 gallons of fresh water down the drain

5688118 when we talked to him about it he asked a lot of questions and we could tell that it was starting to bother him
5688119 he would ask questions like well has this ever happened here before
5688120 but would then promptly return to his xbox she says

5688122 the bank of england can cut rates but as weve seen over the past year theres no guarantee this will translate into a lower true cost of mortgages at least in the short term
5688123 with rates creeping steadily upwards the advice to borrowers looking for a new deal is clear look to minimise your exposure to rate rises by ranking your mortgage on the true cost taking into account repayments as well as all fees
5688124 well mr smith will your answer be yes or no
5688125 your questions were clear and if it was not clear to me i asked you for an explanation

5688131 i became aware of him as he walked near me and then for a moment stood very close to me he did not speak or smile or look at me he just stared at the ground and then very casually he used his foot to draw a cross in the dirt we both stood looking at his work for a minute until he rubbed it out and walked away
5688132 the attacks on my character and integrity are totally without merit or justification i did stand up and say the war was wrong i would speak against the war but i never spoke against my country and i gave up no secrets

5688138 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5688139 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5688140 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5688141 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5688142 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5688143 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5688144 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5688145 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5688146 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5688147 i dont see any other brand being able to build that kind of market in refurbished products
5688148 apple is the only brand i see being able to pull off something like that i dont see any other brand being able to have that kind of following for refurbished products
5688149 generally here in the u s the ipod cool factor is something that continues to drive apples success whether its with a next generation iphone or ipod touch
5688150 its such a phenomenon that everyone seems to be wondering whats coming next
5688151 weve been offering repair services for ipods since march since the beginning we started buying broken ones well service them in a large batch well take and sell those refurbs on some other site
5688152 one of the biggest changes was at amp t was officially subsidizing the phone and they wouldnt let you buy them without a contract
5688153 anyone who wants an iphone has to go through at amp t and all the hassle and contracts and all that
5688154 some would go to consumer to consumer sites like ebay
5688155 we decided to facilitate that secondary market and offer both buyers and sellers an option of where they can get their iphones bought and sold
5688156 right now were in the stage where were just trying to buy a lot of them
5688157 we actually have an official iphone buyback program for fully functional first generation iphones
5688158 weve had a ton of response a lot of people submitting information
5688159 basically they just go to the web site hit the iphone buyback link fill in the information and when they submit it well e mail them a shipping label for them to send it to us you just pack it up safely and ship it to us well verify everything and write them a check
5688160 if youe looking to upgrade to the new iphone and you already have a contract with at amp t that covers most of that
5688161 its really easy and youre working with a reliable vendor
5688162 although its only 200 for a new iphone in the store theres a hidden subsidy youve got 40 a month for the basic phone service and 30 for web connection and 5 a month for 200 text messages
5688163 by the time you have taxes and fees its probably 85 a month for 450 minutes most people are probably spending 100 for more so even though the phone itself is technically cheap there are a lot of hidden costs there
5688164 theres always more problems in selling used computer equipment it doesnt move as fast its not as portable even with the laptops
5688165 most people are going to want to keep a laptop for at least two years after that its not a lot of use to somebody else the main function of the ipod on the other hand is that it plays music laptops built in 2001 would no longer run the kinds of applications needed to run today
5688166 i think people are more likely to keep the device with computers through its useful life until its core functionality is reduced
5688167 theres always going to be a market for a hot product used or otherwise
5688168 i am disappointed i didnt make the world cup finals and wish i knew why it had happened
5688169 i realise it takes more than perfect preparation to become the best skier in the world
5688170 three top 20 results was not bad but i expected so much more
5688171 he greber had taken me as far as he could and he did not know what else to do to make me go any faster
5688172 i needed a fresh approach and mark will provide that
5688173 if the olympic games were held tomorrow zoe would be one of five or six vying for the gold medal
5688174 chemmy has skied really well in patches but she has not really had a good consistent season in terms of results
5688175 there ought to be no excuses now we all know chemmy has got the potential its just a question of putting the right programme in place to allow her to do that
5688176 alain is probably going to take some time over the next couple of months to think about it
5688177 the desire is still there and in training he is still our fastest slalom skier its not quite happening on the hill
5688178 zoes had a fantastic season as a person she has really stepped up a level and is high on confidence
5688179 and lesley has had a really good comeback its the first season she has been fully fit for two or three years
5688180 she has proved she can still compete at the top level the fourth place at the bardonecchia world cup was an excellent result
5688181 cycling is excellent cross training for skiing and cycling around the highlands will provide a genuine challenge
5688182 theres a great competitive spirit brewing among the ski team
5688183 what is the other woman supposed to do while she is on the phone
5688184 if theres justice in the world it will be stopped if the government really means what it says about climate change it would not let this go ahead
5688185 we have been working on this project for six years with costs running into many millions
5688186 at last snoasis will become a reality to the benefit of ipswich suffolk east anglia the country and of course all of our hopes for greater success at major winter sports competitions
5688187 this will give suffolk the tourism boost that it truly deserves and our other local attractions should be able to capitalise on the interest that it will generate
5688188 we had a couple of early chances for twos and the whole week ive been making those
5688189 there has been a couple of time that the ice has actually confused us a couple curled and a couple went straighter we just got baffled a little by that
5688190 the shot in the seventh inning kevin martin played a great hit it was the only place he could have put it and he put it there and mine just curled about 2mm too far and we never got a two out of it its a bit of bad luck
5688191 it was a high risk shot but to be honest i didnt have an awful lot else it was the only shot and it was only millimetres from making it sometimes thats the difference in curling a couple of millmetres here and there and you lose the game
5688192 weve had a great season graeme connel come on board and weve won the europeans and made the final here
5688193 im very proud of my season it was more stressful than last year when no one expected me to win
5688194 im sorry for the way the downhill cup finished i would have preferred that we had a last race so it would be fair for both of us
5688195 i still have a big day on thursday with the super g it would be amazing to win another title
5688196 this civil stoppage represents a severe threat of violence and promises to descend into acts of violence and intimidation
5688197 my starts have not been consistent so this is one of my main aims to work on this summer
5688198 it was one of those that if i won everyone would say shes been to the olympics so she should win and if i hadnt it would have been really embarrassing
5688199 so it was a mixture of joy and relief to win at the brits
5688200 it was the first race she had ever done i am so proud of her
5688201 i definitely feel i have got a good chance of getting a medal its a question of getting everything right in the build up to give myself the best chance of everything going right on that day
5688202 this has been a dream of mine since i was a little kid
5688203 i feel like my childhood dreams are coming true and you cant get any better than that
5688204 its great to seal the deal with two races left thats a big check off on my lifetime goals
5688205 the belgians are a very strong side and i expect a very difficult match from a side that can come from behind with 10 men to beat italy 3 2
5688206 but despite this were still confident that well be able to put smiles on the faces of nigerians by making it to the final on saturday
5688207 yes we played well against cote divoire but that is past belgium is present and we have to concentrate on them ive told the players this and hopefully i expect them to do as instructed
5688208 we will have to raise our game against belgium if were to progress because we know how good they are

5688521 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5688522 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5688523 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5688524 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5688525 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5688526 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information

5688528 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically

5688537 i am a citizen from a country that i consider corrupt and that needs to change a lot before any new debt could do it any good in this respect i urge you not to give debt relief to corrupt governments as that will only allow those addicted to debt to be able to hit the bars again in the same shameful ways as before if the concept of odious debt is applicable in the sense that some debts should not have to be repaid if contracted in an illegitimate way castigating the creditor then the same concept should clearly also apply to the granting of any debt relief punishing the debtor

5688614 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5688615 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5688626 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho

5688630 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso

5688632 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5688649 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5688650 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5688651 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5688652 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5688653 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5688654 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5688655 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5688656 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5688657 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5688658 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5688659 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5688660 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5688661 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5688662 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5688663 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5688664 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5688665 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5688690 scholen voor voortgezet speciaal onderwijs geven aan dat zij een te krap budget krijgen om schoolboeken te kunnen aanschaffen dat komt omdat zij formeel onder het basisonderwijs vallen dat is natuurlijk een rare bureaucratische constructie in het voortgezet onderwijs zijn er meer boeken nodig omdat er meer vakken zijn die boeken zijn vaak ook duurder scholen krijgen daarvoor onvoldoende vergoeding en sturen de rekening soms door naar de ouders dat is een slechte zaak
5688691 als dat op meer scholen gebeurt ga ik ervan uit dat de overheid de bekostiging voor deze scholen verhoogt de kwaliteit van dit onderwijs mag niet in gevaar komen het afwentelen van de kosten op de ouders is uit den boze

5688719 began a hard hitting political attack on obamas national security credentials and stepped up his rhetoric against the russian presence in georgia in remarks intended to showcase his ability to be commander in chief mr mccain criticized what he called mr obamas shifting positions on the troop reinforcements or surge in iraq and said that when his rival voted against financing the troops in a single vote in 2007 he tried to legislate failure
5688720 mccain leads 46 41 percent among men up from 47 44 percent july 15 and 48 40 percent among white voters compared to 49 42 percent last month he also leads 65 25 percent among white evangelical christians up from 61 29 percent
5688721 we were in a forum the other day and rick warren ask mccain well what do you consider rich john mccain oh i dont know maybe 5 million so i guess it is ok this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of tax dollars and tax breaks to people making more 2 5 million because i guess theyre middle class
5688722 so i want to see a show of hands everybody making more than 2 5 million raise your hand you should you know you might want to think about voting for john mccain because he is going to be looking out for them but he is not looking out for most of the people in this auditorium that is what is at stake in this election

5688790 creationism vs evolution come see pz myers in the movie expelled no intelligence allowed
5688791 a single adaptive trait such as color could move a population towards the process of forming a new species but adaptation in many traits may be required to actually complete the formation of an entirely new species
5688792 the more ways a population can adapt to its unique surroundings the more likely it will ultimately diverge into a separate species
5688793 natural selection has been widely regarded as the cause of adaptation within existing species while genetics and geography have been the focus of most current research on the driving force of speciation
5688794 as far as advancing darwins theory that natural selection is a key driver of speciation this is the first experiment of its kind done outside of a lab setting the findings are exciting

5688833 in general we look for a new law by the following process first we guess it then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right then we compare the result of the computation to nature with experiment or experience compare it directly with observation to see if it works
5688834 if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong in that simple statement is the key to science it does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is it does not make any difference how smart you are who made the guess or what his name is if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong that is all there is to it it is true that one has to check a little to make sure that it is wrong because whoever did the experiment may have reported incorrectly or there may have been some feature in the experiment that was not noticed some dirt or something or the man who computed the consequences even though it may have been the one who made the guesses could have made some mistakes in the analysis these are obvious remarks so when i say if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong i mean after the experiment has been checked the calculations have been checked and the thing has been rubbed back and forth a few times to make sure that the consequences are logical consequences from the guess and that in fact it disagrees with a very carefully checked experiment

5688860 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5688861 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5688862 we need to look at all pesticides not just those used in beekeeping
5688863 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal disease they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5688864 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonictotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect hundreds of time more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5688865 this synergistic effect has only been demonstrated to occur under highly artificial laboratory conditions in field trials there was no evidence of synergistic toxicity to honey bees
5688866 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5688867 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5688868 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees

5688872 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5688873 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5688874 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5688875 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5688876 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5688877 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5688878 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5688879 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5688880 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5688881 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5688882 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5688883 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5688884 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides

5688901 where rose the mountains there to him were friends where rolled the ocean thereon was his home where a blue sky and glowing clime extends he had the passion and the power to roam
5688902 i wanted to live deep and suck the marrow of life to drive life into a corner and reduce it to then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience

5688931 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
5688932 corn ethanols been blamed for practically every problem under the sun whats next summer colds computer viruses bad hair days
5688933 corn based ethanols supporters are whining again they want to keep governmental mandates to use the fuel too bad
5688934 biofuels were developed in response to a very serious problem they werent invented just for fun
5688935 a little bit of this a little bit of that
5688936 our current ethanol policy drives up gas prices drives up food prices hurts the environment and taxpayers get to pay 6
5688937 corn ethanol despite its shortcomings isnt going away at least not for a while
5688938 now it looks like the state is turning its hopes toward cellulosic ethanol witness mascoma corp s decision to invest 250 million in a cellulosic etha

5688942 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
5688943 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5688944 i was so mad i was just shaking and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now what what is it that i do i get a doctor i get a surgeon i get an oncologist what do i do
5688945 i immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5688946 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy

5688953 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5688954 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5688955 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5688956 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5688957 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5688958 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5688959 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5688960 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5688961 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5688962 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5688963 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5688964 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5688965 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5688966 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5688967 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands

5688972 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5688973 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5688974 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5688975 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5688976 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5688977 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists
5688978 and internet security experts believe that it could be just as devastating to the u s s economy and infrastructure as a deadly bombing
5688979 hackers mounted coordinated assaults on georgian government media banking and transportation sites in the weeks before russian troops invaded
5688980 the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5688981 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
5688982 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5688983 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5688984 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5688985 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5688986 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5688987 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5688988 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5688989 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5688990 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5688991 if russia threatens poland then we poles have the right to feel threatened
5688992 but this type of statement from russian generals is a problem for all of nato and i expect the alliance to take a stand on this
5688993 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5688994 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5688995 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5688996 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5688997 traditionally there is something which is used to cover their buttocks called umuntsha if they do not have that i kindly suggest that they buy sarongs to cover up
5688998 there are times when maidens have to sing and dance and we end up seeing certain private body parts that were not supposed to see
5688999 i said to him robbed this time of the night i would like to meet such people
5689000 i wanted to kick him in the chest but i actually got him in the face
5689001 accused three hassen had told me outside the house the people were prepared to get a beating and this is what i did
5689002 i said i did not mean to kick you so hard i will wipe it off
5689003 when are you going to finish with him when are you going to shoot him
5689004 at that moment the deceased said to me i have children dont kill me i told him going to be killed thats not how i understand the thing
5689005 i said i did not come here to kill people fuck the job
5689006 i said what the fuck was that waheed and he told me to drive
5689007 i threw the paper in front of him and said waheed what shit have you landed me in he just looked at me and said its not me jeff he did not say anything more he just sat there like a zombie

5689032 franken has finally turned around a campaign that had some trouble in the beginning with plenty of time remaining for the sprint to the finish
5689033 i guess minnesotans saw right through the right wing lies about frankens stance on womens issues and they understand the difference between comedy and what franken represents as a senate candidate
5689034 ive been tracking these polls for months franken has difficulty reaching the mid forties in fact hes occasionally had difficulty reaching the forties its difficult to take a challenger seriously if they cant break the forty percent mark
5689035 the fact that coleman has nearly a 20 point edge over franken with independents is just devastating

5689109 una receta para el desastre el apetito insaciable de los supermercados por los productos pesqueros
5689110 pese a que espa a es uno de los mayores centros mundiales de consumo de productos pesqueros hasta ahora nuestros supermercados no han prestado ninguna atenci n al papel que pueden jugar a la hora de mejorar los problemas de sobreexplotaci n de nuestros mares
5689111 los supermercados en espa a son c mplices de la destrucci n de los oc anos al no comprometerse con la sostenibilidad de los productos pesqueros
5689112 los consumidores tienen el derecho a que los supermercados les garanticen que todos los productos son sostenibles ya que ellos no tienen acceso a toda la informaci n necesaria
5689113 i think everyone loves the novelty of a robot that can pour beer weve had a few bartenders who have said with this guy on the scene my jobs in danger but given that he cost 100 000 pounds to make it may be a while before that happens
5689114 hes been pretty reliable so far its just a matter of making sure the beer cooler is on and that hes booted up properly before serving
5689115 a major part of bartending is the social skills being able to read the customer and engage in conversation know when theyre getting ready for another drink its down to the personal touch the way you handle the glass and mix the cocktail
5689116 certainly i have to say bravo to the people who created a robot that can bartend its quite something to have invented such a complex machine but i think human bar staff jobs are quite safe
5689117 when you work behind a bar youre involving yourself in somebodys life
5689118 and while a robot might be sitting there smiling as its pouring your drink and doing it really quickly theres nothing better than being met at the bar by somebody who has a genuine smile on their face and can engage with you properly

5689128 tienen pr cticamente derecho a hacer lo que les de la gana porque en un mercado libre pueden fijar el precio que quieran
5689129 las van a enviar a otro departamento porque no tienen capacidad para sancionar y abrir expedientes
5689130 de todas formas vamos a intentar meter todas reclamaciones que nos llegan al 012 al portal del consumidor o que hacen los consumidores por internet en los expedientes luego intentaremos saber luego que hace aviaci n civil que todav a no lo hemos conseguido saber

5689158 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
5689159 we know what messages will work and what will not
5689160 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
5689161 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
5689162 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
5689163 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
5689164 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
5689165 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
5689166 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
5689167 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
5689168 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
5689169 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
5689170 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend
5689171 simplistic remedies likely to make things worse in the longer term currency guru george soros is probably right a global economy needs a global central bank and a global framework of fiscal discipline in a word world government the national governments still have too much power to deviate from central monetary and fiscal guidelines
5689172 constitutions are both the licence to govern and the limit on excessive government
5689173 the triads of molmutius who ruled britain about 450 bc probably provide the first simple constitution in british history
5689174 habeas corpus the essence of english common law states quite clearly that no man may be held guilty until his crime has been proved
5689175 it was the same principles which were to be found in the magna carta in the year 1215 described so vividly by sir winston churchill in his history of the english speaking peoples in these words when in subsequent ages the state swollen with its own authority has attempted to ride roughshod over the rights and liberties of the subject it is to this doctrine that appeal has again and again been made and never as yet without success
5689176 the famous english constitutional authority sir william blackstone pronounced upon magna carta as follows it protected every individual of the nation in the free enjoyment of his life his liberty and his property unless declared forfeited by the judgement of his peers or by the law of the land
5689177 it is important to note that all totalitarian contenders for power have directed their attacks upon the constitution and the upper house hitler on his assumption of power in germany in the thirties abolished the upper house in germany it stood in the way of his bid for power
5689178 in considering the value of our written federal constitution in australia it is essential to grasp that it was a grant of special powers from the states to the federal government
5689179 undoubtedly the most urgent task of all is to rally the entire community to defend the existing federal constitution which stands as a barrier to the policies of those who would subvert our heritage
5689180 all power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely
5689181 all governments irrespective of their label tend to increase their own powers
5689182 the history of liberty is the limitation of government power not the increase of it
5689183 the more centralised a nation becomes the greater the corruption at the top

5689188 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for september 6 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5689189 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5689190 the georgian football federation has until august 26 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of september 6 2008 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match

5689200 i like warren and recommended him to wales but he should stick to coaching
5689201 one of graham henrys problems when he was coaching wales was that he started to get involved with areas that were no concern of the national coach

5689226 given there has been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted
5689227 indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5689228 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5689229 weighing up all these considerations members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being
5689230 nonetheless given the slower trend in demand scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing
5689231 broader measures that included job advertisements on the internet were also softening and employment intentions from a range of business surveys suggested employment growth would moderate in the period ahead

5689253 in orlando five democrats are running in the primary for the chance to challenge republican rep ric keller a top democratic target they include businessman charlie stuart who lost to keller in the general election in 2006 attorney mike smith and alan grayson who lost to stuart in the democratic primary in 2006
5689254 on the space coast republicans and democrats are in primaries to succeed outgoing republican rep dave weldon whose retirement created the only open seat in the state republican state sen bill posey who has two opponents in the primary has been considered the favorite to win the republican leaning seat but democrats are enthusiastic about the candidacy of paul rancatore an air force reserve officer he faces physician stephen blythe in the primary

5689261 so much for hugging in church a day after barack obama and john mccain exchanged an embrace during a faith forum at a california megachurch obama called the u s economy a disaster thanks to john mccains president george w bush and chided his republican rivals campaign team for trying to make him look unpatriotic and weak

5689270 the thing that leaps out at you from his game is an appreciation of a pass
5689271 when a team mate received the ball from him the pass almost told him where his opponent was
5689272 it had all the information on it you would need and it was invariably the right ball his retention of the ball is good and we are not talking about a player who merely chose the easy option he was equally adept at simple passes and marvellously weighted diagonals in behind the centre backs
5689273 a player who receives the ball under pressure is very very composed can pick a pass and score a goal and is not afraid to make a tackle as well

5689675 when i spoke to her she was very upset frightened and i tried to reassure her as best i could this is a massive blow for her
5689676 it is pretty obvious that she was looking forward to her time in the house but her health is the first priority and she is flying back for treatment

5689704 i never heard of that we have a recycling committee and thats never been brought up
5689705 i do think theres more interest and enthusiasm about green programs
5689706 i think the profile of recycling is being elevated because the public is aware of the energy were saving its a practice thats available to most people that we can do that can have an impact on climate change

5689741 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5689742 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5689743 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5689744 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5689745 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5689746 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5689747 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5689748 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5689749 i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics and the same people who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5689750 mccains worth over 100 million he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet he walks around in 520 italian loafers
5689751 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you
5689752 these sporting activities will run competitively at the zonal level from monday august 4 till saturday september 6 this year with each of the 12 zonal commands as well as the force head quarters organizing qualifiers to the national finals in a one week grand finale to be hosted in lagos the nations commercial hub
5689753 it is against this background that we keep statistics of our young players and monitor their progress
5689754 we cannot be content with sending sports people to major international events to simply gain experience after 18 years of independence whilst experience is critical it is equally time that we as investors and as a nation start demanding returns on our investment
5689755 there is not a day that passes without us being fed so much negativity that we run the risk of being renamed from being the land of the brave to the land of the mourners if we are not complaining about the poor showing of our sportsmen and women it is about the sorry state of the administration of many codes or infighting for positions i am sure we are all agreed that this state of affairs is no manner in which to build a winning nation
5689756 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5689757 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5689758 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5689759 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5689760 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5689761 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5689762 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5689763 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5689764 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5689765 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5689766 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5689767 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5689768 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5689769 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5689770 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5689771 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5689772 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5689773 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5689774 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5689775 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5689776 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5689777 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5689778 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5689779 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5689780 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5689781 we are determined to spring surprise in the tournament the team is under intensive training and we are confident we can win the title
5689782 the homeless world cup foundation has now been set up to support and develop grassroot football programmes to engage one million players who are homeless
5689783 you should be footballers with vision and always bear in mind that you represent more than half of the namibian population for being the only team from the far north playing in the npl
5689784 we need your moral and financial support so sacrifice available resources in motivating players so as to get more at the end of the league season
5689785 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5689786 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5689787 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5689788 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5689789 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5689790 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5689791 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5689792 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5689793 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5689794 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5689795 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5689796 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5689797 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5689798 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5689799 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5689800 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5689801 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5689802 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5689803 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5689804 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5689805 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5689806 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5689807 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5689808 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5689809 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5689810 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5689811 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5689812 just meet the deadline after doing the best you can
5689813 we have to ask ourselves why formats like blogs social networks and other manifestations of emerging digital media have become so popular blogs look nothing like micro sites but what they have in common is the delivery
5689814 web pages pages that can be bookmarked and e mailed among other things and they offer niche content lots of links and of course the ability for people to talk back
5689815 you stand up for what you believe in even if it gets in the way of what other people think you are proud of yourself and your accomplishments and you enjoy letting people know that

5689864 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5689865 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5689866 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5689867 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5689868 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5689869 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5689870 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5689871 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5689872 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5689873 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5689874 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight

5689882 we can now offer our students basketball and soccer and the money raised goes toward renting facilities and paying referees without the little league world series we wouldnt have enough money to fund the athletic program
5689883 our company is dedicated to giving sports fans the best in concessions and culinary offerings but we also want to make a difference in our communities our vendor program in williamsport and in so many of the stadiums we operate enables us to help people and change lives thats what its all about
5689884 theres great camaraderie and everyone gets to know each other sportservice is more than accommodating with us and they go out of their way to make it a great experience were very proud to be part of this event
5689885 last year the hundreds of non profit organizations we worked with received more than 15 million from sportservice for programs and activities important to them and their community
5689886 jalil was with the first string usually hes with the twos
5689887 we lost a great player in terrence wheatley and also in ben burney so we lost some experience
5689888 but i feel like this year we have a lot of depth a lot of the young guys know the playbook this time where last year only the starters knew all the plays now you put in a sub and theyre going to get the job done
5689889 last year we knew the plays but we didnt know every check or what you do if they audible this year weve seen it so we know what to do now so its kicking in a lot faster and we can react a lot faster
5689890 its just baby steps we have five guys in contention for two jobs and each one is making a different push each day
5689891 i dont look like as if anything is different with me but i might have trouble saying or seeing something
5689892 nf is a common genetic condition which is under recognized by both physicians and the public
5689893 all those patients dont have a voice and often feel very self conscious and misunderstood
5689894 i sometimes feel electricity shooting down my body just completely unexpected
5689895 i cant deal with most people the rudeness people have the outright pointing staring screwed up face while looking at me
5689896 when i go out i need to have my guard on im ready for a comment or a look and thats why i have my cards
5689897 on halloween a kid asked me if i had a mask on
5689898 its not recommended procedure because there are just too many to remove
5689899 and it may not be worth the risk of sensory and nerve damage
5689900 the researchers focus on the illness but the patients focus on discrimination
5689901 they might not have a life threatening form but every day is like being a cancer survivor for them
5689902 when i bring up nf people are not accepting of that
5689903 my mother has taught me that i am no different from everyone else and has always strived to make me independent
5689904 i just think we need to find a cure for this
5689905 this is money well spent and other programs are not seeing the same cuts
5689906 if we try to understand this disease there will undoubtedly be other spinoffs that will help us in other areas of medicine

5689916 my favorite thing to do is to play with my sister
5689917 we are creating our social norms and the culture of our school
5689918 its like the whole neighborhood has been holding its breath for the whole year and today we finally get to ahhhhh
5689919 were so excited weve been planning thinking and organizing for this day for a full year one year ago right where were standing used to be just dirt
5689920 my third grader wanted me to be here when he got off the bus
5689921 but i forgot my camera at least i got pictures of them getting ready and getting on the bus
5689922 parents are excited to have another choice in the tri town area
5689923 its close and we felt like it was a better options than some of our neighborhood schools
5689924 we very much wanted to have a collaborative relationship with the district
5689925 most of the folks involved came at this from a parents perspective so we had a lot to learn
5689926 there are a number of things that are attractive about montessori
5689927 there will always be more things on the plate than can ever be done
5689928 ive just been real inconsistent so far ive been mid 70s or mid 80s so its just been up and down
5689929 its my senior year so i definitely want to be as low as possible every time out
5689930 it definitely gives me some confidence for the rest of the year
5689931 the cool breeze wet grass i kind of liked it
5689932 we finished fourth in the two league tournaments and with three freshman thats super
5689933 i figured if we finished in the top five id be happy so theyve done an excellent job
5689934 its going to take our other guys to step up a lot too
5689935 were all kind of in the same boat just been inconsistent
5689936 i hit my target she just ripped it and that was it
5689937 i felt terrible for the seniors i took all the blame on me it took me a long time to get over it that bus ride i did shed a few tears i still think about it to this day it does happen and its going to but youve just to learn from it
5689938 even with her young age last year she kind of fit in with the seniors
5689939 her game garners a lot of respect from the other players and its something they look up to
5689940 it was a great feeling knowing that i showed him and he believed in me
5689941 i was always judged by my size and everybody told me i couldnt hit with power
5689942 ive been able to hit balls over the fence and ive gotten a bunch of triples
5689943 shes a tough out every time at the plate and you can put her anywhere in the field as well
5689944 but we do have a lot of quickness and talent
5689945 im confident more so than last year especially hopefully when we get to that regional point
5689946 that patriot league schedule will prepare us for regionals and well be ready for anything someone throws at us
5689947 were going to go into this season with that game in our mind
