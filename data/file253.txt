2530000 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2530001 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2530002 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2530003 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2530004 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2530005 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2530006 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2530007 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2530008 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2530009 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2530010 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2530011 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2530012 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2530013 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2530014 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2530015 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2530016 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2530017 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2530018 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2530019 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2530020 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2530021 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2530022 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2530023 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2530024 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2530025 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2530026 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2530027 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2530028 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2530029 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2530030 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2530031 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2530032 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2530033 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2530034 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2530035 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2530036 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2530037 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2530038 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2530039 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2530040 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2530041 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2530042 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2530043 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2530044 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2530045 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2530046 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2530047 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2530048 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2530049 real results by the end of my first term in office
2530050 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2530051 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2530052 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2530053 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2530054 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2530055 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2530056 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2530057 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2530058 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2530059 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2530060 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2530061 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2530062 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2530063 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2530064 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2530065 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2530066 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2530067 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2530068 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2530069 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2530070 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2530071 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2530072 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2530073 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2530074 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2530075 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2530076 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2530077 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2530078 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2530079 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2530080 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2530081 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2530082 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2530083 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2530084 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2530085 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2530086 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2530087 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2530088 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2530089 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2530090 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2530091 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2530092 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2530093 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2530094 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2530095 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2530096 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2530097 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2530098 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2530099 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2530100 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2530101 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2530102 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
2530103 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation
2530104 the weight per unit of area of a column of air that reaches to the top of the atmosphere
2530105 shifts in rainfall patterns cloud cover and warming temperatures triggered a 6 percent increase in the amount of carbon stored in trees grass shrubs and flowers
2530106 global climate change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around the globe allowing vegetation to increase 6 percent
2530107 increased atmospheric co2 and climate change are the primary causes of the recent
2530108 when the atmosphere gets hazy like it did after the eruption of mt pinatubo in the philippines in june 1991 plants photosynthesize more efficiently thereby absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
2530109 diversity increases as the planet warms and decreases as it cools
2530110 some as large as a dozen miles across are having a major impact on the ecology of the ocean around them serving as hotspots for ocean life with thriving communities of seabirds above and a web of phytoplankton krill and fish below

2530113 significantly changes the planets distance from the sun during its long year which lasts 248 earth years
2530114 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2530115 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2530116 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2530117 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2530118 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2530119 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2530120 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2530121 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2530122 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2530123 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2530124 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2530125 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
2530126 snow cover over north america and much of is greater than at any time since 1966
2530127 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
2530128 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
2530129 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2530130 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2530131 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2530132 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2530133 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2530134 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2530135 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2530136 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
2530137 free drifting icebergs hotspots of chemical and biological enrichment in the

2530139 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2530140 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2530141 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2530142 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2530143 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2530144 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2530145 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2530146 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2530147 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2530148 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2530149 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2530150 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2530151 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2530152 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2530153 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2530154 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2530155 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2530156 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2530157 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2530158 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2530159 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2530160 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2530161 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2530162 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2530163 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2530164 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2530165 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2530166 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2530167 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2530168 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2530169 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2530170 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2530171 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2530172 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2530173 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2530174 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2530175 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2530176 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2530177 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2530178 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2530179 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2530180 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2530181 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2530182 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2530183 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2530184 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2530185 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2530186 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2530187 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
2530188 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
2530189 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
2530190 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2530191 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2530192 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2530193 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2530194 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2530195 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2530196 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2530197 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2530198 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2530199 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2530200 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2530201 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2530202 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2530203 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2530204 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2530205 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2530206 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2530207 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2530208 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2530209 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2530210 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2530211 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2530212 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2530213 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2530214 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2530215 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2530216 me gustar a ser rico y que bueno que no soy pobre y dios me libre de padecerlo
2530217 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2530218 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2530219 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2530220 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock
2530221 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2530222 our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2530223 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring

2530225 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2530226 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2530227 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2530228 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2530229 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2530230 just why is it so cool to watch lesbians fuck
2530231 the lower figure on teens having sex means the risk of sexually transmitted diseases is lower
2530232 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2530233 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2530234 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition

2530237 that shows he thought of us while he was doing it
2530238 see you later unless i meet some other hot chick who wants me to come home with her ha ha just kidding
2530239 it makes me respect a guy when he puts me in my place when i veer off course
2530240 i love it that you dont care that i dont shave for weeks
2530241 please show me you love me even though im disgusting and in need of correction
2530242 until you realize he is a loser who requires his girlfriends to sign legally binding contracts
2530243 the key to healthy heterosexual relationships emotionally abuse women until their will is broken
2530244 her ex husband did that to her and she put up with it for x years so i can do it too
2530245 she left his sorry ass so id better not try that
2530246 my friends treat their wives this way and theyve been together for 25 years therefore it works
2530247 read and hear enough of this tripe in the popular culture and you cant help but conclude that women are incredibly irritating and loathsome creatures and that we are incredibly lucky that men even tolerate us
2530248 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
2530249 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2530250 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2530251 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2530252 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2530253 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2530254 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2530255 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2530256 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
2530257 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
2530258 its a very real possibility that half siblings could meet and form a relationship
2530259 it shouldnt be a question of if we are told but when
2530260 many of our female students must have grown a lot lately as the skirts suddenly seem very short
2530261 can we please ensure the skirts are a decent length
2530262 brighton acts too much like a private school when it comes to uniforms
2530263 you just want the girls to be kids you are not interested in having beauty queens wafting around the yard
2530264 uniforms by themselves cannot solve all of the problems of school discipline and safety but they can be one positive contributing factor
2530265 we expect all employees to drive with care both for reasons of safety and cost
2530266 we are now reviewing the governments vehicle insurance arrangements with a view to improving the accountability of drivers and reducing the number of crashes and claims
2530267 we did a six week program for a bridal party where the bride her mum fiance and two bridesmaids combined lost 45kg
2530268 its not about overworking people we get results by teaching life balance
2530269 it is disappointing to hear of programs like this that perpetuate the idea that the only beautiful bride is a thin bride
2530270 these types of boot camp programs are actually doing people a disservice most dieters regained any weight they lost and often ended up heavier
2530271 they also tend to develop very unhealthy attitudes towards food
2530272 ladies and gentleman put your hands together for the new mr and mrs salinger
2530273 because im a big ole granola liberal and i wanted to tweak the tradition while showing my wife i love her
2530274 and what about the poor children will no one think of the children
2530275 and what about the poor children will no one think of the children
2530276 but right now dont we have the same problems tracing our mothers genealogy because they changed their last names
2530277 i have two last names like catharine zeta jones does
2530278 we really need to cultivate members of such and such group why dont you have your wife host a get to know you tea for their wives and our wives
2530279 the negotiations for that big deal seem to be going really well but it would be probably smooth the way a bit if we all got to know each other a little better i think you should have your wife put together a dinner party this weekend for the men involved and their wives
2530280 this was really quite a spread that you put on its nice that you have something to keep you busy
2530281 it is a not a shameful thing to be at home with the children it should be desired
2530282 like prostitution marriage is an institution that is extremely oppressive and dangerous for women
2530283 feminism stresses the indistinguishability of prostitution marriage and sexual harassment
2530284 by getting married the woman has consented to sex and i dont think you can call it rape
2530285 i think it is wrong for a woman to say no to sex to her husband but it is equally wrong and sinful for a man to force sex on his wife
2530286 i think it is wrong for a woman to say no to sex to her husband
2530287 the injection of force into the equation is another matter altogether that is the issue here
2530288 the woman does not belong to herself but to her husband
2530289 just as a man does not belong to himself but to his wife
2530290 theres the hole go for it big guy let me know if it was good for you
2530291 no honey this is when i hurl the mayo jar at your head
2530292 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
2530293 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2530294 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2530295 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2530296 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
2530297 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
2530298 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
2530299 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
2530300 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
2530301 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
2530302 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
2530303 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
2530304 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
2530305 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems
2530306 the departed was already not high on my list of favored films because its very violent and im not much into violent movies in jack nicholsons first scene he asks a comely young diner waitress if shes got her period yet and leers at her its gross beyond words the level of homophobia is also pretty freakish
2530307 oh my god i could barely even look at him without blushing
2530308 please dont wear them with v neck shirts or thin shirts that are depressed by the pendants weight
2530309 at the office the men are covered from neck to toe in suits while i on my most modest day am likely to be showing more of my arms and at least part of my legs
2530310 as a guy what is your responsibility in this area what is your role in guarding your eyes and mind as opposed to the womens role of dressing modestly
2530311 you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery but i say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart
2530312 you have less respect for an immodest girl than for a modest one
2530313 what did jesus say about the end of the world what did he mean what do the parables tell us about jesus view of the kingdom also what did theologians and scholars conclude about jesuss beliefs based on your reading of the bible do you agree with conclusions about what jesus meant if so what implications might that have for christian belief how does christian eschatology differ from jewish eschatology
2530314 going back to the roots where christianity is thoroughly political and thoroughly liberal
2530315 i disagree profoundly with much of what the bible contains but the fact is that it is a foundational text for western culture
2530316 where exactly does it say marys a virgin if this hebrew word here just means young woman
2530317 there will be some places where non christian students are made to feel profoundly uncomfortable in their own public schools
2530318 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
2530319 wonderful jesus i simply cant do this on my own even though ive tried helping others and the world without you it only further inflates my feeling of self love jesus take this life and i trust you to use it toward your will
2530320 im not a feminist i want to be a stay at home mother someday
2530321 youre going to have a stroke on your right side
2530322 hes not the one just wait dont listen to what he says
2530323 to know how this happens at the molecular level how things bounce skip spin tumble push and pull represents a big leap in our understanding
2530324 we are pleased that the nih has again recognized the potential of our revolutionary nanoscale single molecule imaging and analysis technology by awarding us this new grant which is explicitly intended to support the development of a platform to produce consistent linearization and imaging of individual dna molecules allowing for high resolution mapping of labeled genomic sites
2530325 this added support will help us accelerate the development of the platform which we believe could add significantly to the understanding of genetic diseases by increasing access to whole genome analysis and by allowing researchers to view and analyze the critical haplotype information that is currently difficult to obtain
2530326 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state
2530327 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
2530328 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2530329 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
2530330 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
2530331 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
2530332 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
2530333 tv is not vulgar and prurient and dumb because the people who compose the audience are vulgar and dumb
2530334 clinical trial volume is growing as drug companies are downsizing and consolidating
2530335 so theyre looking to hire flexible contract resource organizations cros to manage the volume
2530336 big pharmaceuticals need to outsource to save money biotechs have to outsource because they dont have an option
2530337 the latter are patients who dont take any prescription drugs and thus are best suited for clinical trials treatment naive patients are more likely to be found in emerging markets outside of the u s and western europe
2530338 growth in this industry is increasingly happening in emerging economies like eastern europe south america and the pacific rim
2530339 said john kreger an analyst at william blair amp co
2530340 this is a service business and they are doing excellent work on time on budget with clean data
2530341 the barrier to entry in this business is all about a track record
2530342 a client is unlikely to hire a company that doesnt have a track record
2530343 thats a feature of more phase three programs going on and the amount of data required

2530375 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2530376 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous

2530382 all doping charges against monika have been cleared by sai but ioa has not agreed on the ground that time is very short and they wont be able to reopen the entry process for her but they will be trying to send her to beijing tonight
2530383 when were on the competition ground the best thing to do is just to live up to our own standards we cant pay attention to judging issues
2530384 we knew to compete with china we cannot make any mistakes and today we made a few
2530385 we made some mistakes and we have to make sure we dont repeat them in final
2530386 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2530387 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2530388 wnba star lauren jackson led medal favorite australia with 18 points and 10 rebounds as the opals opened with an 83 64 win over belarus
2530389 our girls were challenged by the fact we have never played belarus
2530390 for us it was a significant game and i think our recent loss in the diamond ball against the usa helped prepare us for today
2530391 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2530392 in other matches beon yeon ha and choi you nah each scored 19 points to help south korea beat brazil 68 62 in overtime and new zealand edged mali 76 72 in the final match tatiana shchegoleva and ilona korstin scored 13 points each to give russia a 62 57 victory over latvia
2530393 we have admired chris from afar in the past he has a wealth of experience after playing for several championship teams
2530394 he is more than 6ft tall with a long throw and has great experience
2530395 im disappointed we have spent a lot of time negotiating with celtic for it to end like this but we move on
2530396 in football sometimes things like this happen and celtic have done us the courtesy of officially retracting their interest in signing gabriel
2530397 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2530398 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2530399 the attack shortly after midday at the site darkened the mood in the olympics host city just hours after the spectacular opening ceremony had set an ebullient tone following years of nervous buildup
2530400 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others accompanying the victim
2530401 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2530402 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2530403 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2530404 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2530405 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2530406 although the law department was prepared to aggressively defend the city against mr askews allegations it was anticipated that the civil suit would have been tried to a jury
2530407 a jury finding in favor of mr askew could have resulted in damages against the city of several million dollars

2530427 at our recent house show in georgia i did indeed dislocate my right shoulder after taking shelton benjamin s finisher
2530428 i basically landed with my arm stretched across my body my body weight his body weight and the force that he applied in delivering the maneuver caused my shoulder to pop right out of the socket
2530429 im going to tell you right now it was honestly the most painful thing that i have ever endured in my life up to this point aside from watching a great khali promo i was able to get some relief in the locker room after being held down by two people while a doctor pulled twisted and popped it back into place the pain immediately went from a 10 to 1 and i was so relieved that i actually started laughing
2530430 i have a torn labrum which basically is a muscle in the shoulder joint that holds everything in place
2530431 i also have some damage in the rotator cuff muscles but its from the accumulative effects of being in the ring for ten years im going to spend the next two weeks in pensacola doing two a day rehab sessions
2530432 after two weeks doc james andrews will assess my progress and determine if i have to have surgery or not if not ill have an additional 2 to 4 weeks before i can return to the ring if surgery is required ill be out for 4 6 months

2530443 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2530444 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports
2530445 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2530446 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2530447 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2530448 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2530449 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too

2530505 ich trete hier nicht an aus irgendeiner show wenn die w hlerinnen und w hler uns beauftragen werde ich das amt des ministerpr sidenten wieder bernehmen
2530506 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2530507 ein missbr uchliches verhalten ist im stromsektor wesentlich schwerer nachzuweisen als im gassektor
2530508 insofern ist es auch eine verletzung von v lkerrecht wenn jetzt hier ein solcher versuch gemacht wird milit risch vorzugehen
2530509 es ist ein sinnloser ein blutiger krieg der das problem dieser abtr nnigen provinz s dossetien von georgien mit sicherheit nicht l sen wird
2530510 diese skepsis wird durch die aktuellen vorg nge verst rkt
2530511 er muss wissen wer anf ngt zu eskalieren bringt kr fte an den tag die er nicht mehr kontrollieren kann
2530512 ich rufe alle zur m igung auf aber russland verh lt sich nicht neutral in diesem konflikt sondern sucht die auseinandersetzung mit georgien und hat zur eskalation der lage beigetragen
2530513 der kreml hat diese zwangslage ganz bewusst herbei gef hrt
2530514 nossos pensamentos e ora es est o com as v timas e seus familiares e o governo dos estados unidos colocou disposi o da fam lia das v timas a assist ncia que considerarem necess ria
2530515 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2530516 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2530517 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2530518 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2530519 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2530520 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2530521 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2530522 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2530523 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2530524 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2530525 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2530526 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2530527 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2530528 el objetivo es sembrar para que crezca en el futuro un estado democr tico y desarrollado

2530541 es gibt keine gesicherten studien dass diese technik wirklich funktioniert
2530542 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt

2530563 you said that theres nothing else to do you didnt give me any task
2530564 ich erwarte dass er binnenmarkt kommissar charlie mccreevy die red jetzt an das thema rangeht auch wenn die kommission n chstes jahr aus dem amt scheidet ich will das zu einer nagelprobe machen
2530565 in diese kategorie fallen 16 millionen oder 80 prozent aller europ ischen unternehmen von diesen firmen bearbeiten 90 prozent nur einen regionalen allenfalls einen nationalen markt mit europa haben die nichts zu tun trotzdem m ssen sie aufgrund einer europ ischen vorgabe eine weit ber eine steuerliche gewinn und verlust rechnung hinausgehende bilanz vorlegen sie m ssen diese einem buchpr fer vorlegen und dann auch noch ver ffentlichen ich sage weg damit
2530566 die europ ische kommission muss jetzt diesen vorschlag annehmen oder ablehnen daran wird sich zeigen ob sie es mit dem b rokratieabbau wirklich ernst meint
2530567 werden unsere vorschl ge im unternehmensrecht insgesamt gerechnet dann steigt das volumen auf 7 3 milliarden euro
2530568 die unternehmen k mpfen ohnehin mit steigenden rohstoff und lohnkosten sie rationalisieren gelingt es uns da die auch von der europ ischen ebene ausgehenden b rokratiekosten zu senken wird das wie eine steuersenkung wirken so k nnten wir deutlich zum wirtschaftswachstum beitragen
2530569 wir haben das mit einer neuen studie in unserer high level group untersucht und vom ergebnis war ich selbst berrascht von allen gesetzen die zwischen 1998 und 2004 in deutschland neu in kraft getreten sind hatten 84 4 prozent ihren ursprung in br ssel
2530570 nur noch 15 6 prozent der gesetze entsprangen aus der nationalen politik daran wird auch deutlich dass politik und medien in deutschland das entstehen von europ ischen richtlinien und verordnungen viel st rker transparent machen sollten
2530571 wir brauchen ber dieses thema eine ffentliche debatte und ich werde diese in den aussch ssen des parlaments f hren die krux liegt doch im prinzip darin die europ ische gesetzgebung findet weitgehend unter ausschluss der ffentlichkeit statt
2530572 beamte in der kommission machen einen entwurf beamte im rat stimmen daf r oder dagegen debatten im europ ischen parlament finden in den mitgliedstaaten keinen ffentlichen niederschlag die so in fachgremien entstandenen gesetze werden dann den b rgern vor die nase gesetzt und erst dann bekommen sie mit was da eigentlich auf sie zukommt ndern aber l sst sich nichts mehr da liegt der hund begraben
2530573 wirtschaftsverb nde und unternehmen m ssen sich in den europ ischen gesetzgebungsprozess genauso fr h und intensiv einschalten wie sie das auf nationaler ebene gewohnt sind
2530574 da gibt es immer wieder so etwas wie eine verschw rung der ressortminister aller l nder die hecken dann in br ssel gemeinsam mit den dortigen beamten und ohne ausreichende beteiligung der nationalen regierungen und parlamente gesetze aus anschlie end m ssen diese in den l ndern umgesetzt werden selbst wenn sie wirtschaft und b rger belasten

2530579 what have i done wrong to be punished like this
2530580 churches use the concept of forgiveness to short circuit the survival empowerment process the church cannot bear to hear about child sexual abuse so the quicker a child forgives the easier it is for the listener
2530581 devastated spirituality the impact of clergy sexual abuse on the survivors relationship with god and the church
2530582 christianity and child sexual abuse the survivors voice leading to change
2530583 throughout history and in every segment of society the most common response to the suspicion or even the disclosure of childhood sexual abuse has been self defensive denial and dissociation no one finds it easy to stand in the overwhelming and destabilizing reality of sexual abuse
2530584 i would also draw your attention to another aspect of the whole question while acknowledging the right to due freedom of information one cannot acquiesce in treating moral evil as an occasion for sensationalism public opinion often feeds on sensationalism and the mass media play a particular role therein in fact the search for sensationalism leads to the loss of something which is essential to the morality of society

2530627 any child who dishonors his her mother or father in any way should be stoned to death
2530628 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry
2530629 if the test results on the final samples are no more accurate then the answer is that something very nasty happened in there we dont know exactly what and because we cant prove who or what it was there is no possibility of a successful homicide investigation
2530630 we have had problems dating the bones but instead of people saying how unfortunate it is that the science cant be of more help to us the politicians are saying this is a waste of time the fact that were trying to bring people to justice for awful abuse is ignored and its just a constant day by day attack on the inquiry and on the victims
2530631 one file has been with the attorney generals office since april 29 and its still showing no signs of moving at the moment its been very frustrating
2530632 i dont think they are involved in child abuse its more like an old boy network
2530633 the ordinary people of jersey are overwhelmingly in favour of the inquiry but how many expressions of support and sympathy for the victims have we heard from the politicians none they dont do sympathy for the victims
2530634 they had been taken from one part of the building to another and put on top of the hard compact undisturbed original floor of the cellars they had been spread about and covered with a thin layer of topsoil why would someone do that unless there was a deliberate attempt to conceal them
2530635 people might say these killings must have happened in the 60s but there may have been someone who had been working there for 30 or 40 years who knew that something had happened but even then it might not have been a homicide it could have been that children died of natural causes accidents or suicide we just dont know
2530636 it is absolutely incorrect to say that we have obstructed the administration of justice and quite improper to make such a comment
2530637 det finns en risk f r det vi f r se vad som h nder
2530638 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
2530639 it needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it
2530640 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530641 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before
2530642 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530643 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530644 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2530645 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2530646 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2530647 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2530648 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2530649 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530650 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2530651 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2530652 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2530653 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2530654 no georgia i believe started a war in southern ossetia and we are responsible to keep the peace
2530655 we have been appreciative of the american efforts to pacify the hawks in tbilisi apparently these efforts have not succeeded quite a number of officials in washignton were really shocked when all this happened
2530656 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2530657 they mark dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2530658 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible

2530662 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530663 iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear program
2530664 the west should try to find a solution to the iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic settlement
2530665 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
2530666 concluded in the unsc united nations security council and fully and completely returned to the agency the international atomic energy agency
2530667 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
2530668 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
2530669 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
2530670 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
2530671 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
2530672 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
2530673 there are lots of opinions about where were headed with iran and a lot of healthy discussion
2530674 but to set the debate along the lines of to bomb or not to bomb isnt a fair characterization
2530675 the views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration
2530676 theres a lot about iran that we still just dont understand
2530677 a lot of generals are saying are you sure you really want to do this
2530678 unless its happened in the deepest recesses of the pentagon ive never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of iran
2530679 the no 1 problem we have is where are the targets we still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect
2530680 the strait is always the key for war games in the gulf
2530681 nobodys underestimating irans ability to disrupt access to the strait
2530682 people brush over the tanker wars but the navy hasnt forgotten
2530683 they said hezbollah is the a team and not someone we want to take on because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al qaeda
2530684 conveyed his less than enthusiastic view of an israeli attack
2530685 from an iranian perspective israel would be flying american made f 15s and f 16s dropping bombs made in the usa
2530686 within the pentagon not only do they see the downsides they tend to think that if someones going to do this they dont want to see it outsourced to another air force
2530687 i dont know whether that keeps an operation from happening olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out
2530688 i for one am convinced that its a very real possibility
2530689 regionally there was very strong interest in limiting irans growth and power that we havent exploited as a country
2530690 we could get small concessions and promises to talk again
2530691 but there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say this idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now
2530692 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530693 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2530694 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2530695 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
2530696 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
2530697 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
2530698 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments reply 491 on today at 02 34 25 am reply 492 on today at 06 27 49 am how about some truth mullahs and nukes do not mix wmds do not mix
2530699 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
2530700 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
2530701 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
2530702 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

2530706 ich habe den druck in der qualifikation sehr gemerkt aber jetzt gehe ich in das finale eher locker rein jetzt habe ich die chance mir im finale den traum zu erf llen
2530707 deshalb habe ich die bung etwas abgespeckt im finale werde ich nun noch etwas draufpacken
2530708 man muss zu jeder zeit bereit sein ob das am morgen ist am mittag oder am abend

2530721 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2530722 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2530723 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2530724 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2530725 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2530726 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2530727 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2530728 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2530754 yesterday the ditsy dems in the house issued an official apology to blacks for slavery and segregation as if that was the most pressing issue facing our great country forget sky high gas prices forget the refusal of dems to let america drill for her own oil forget the war on terrorism forget mounting foreclosures no the one thing america must do is apologize for something that ended over 100 years ago without that mea culpa the country cant go on gimme a break let me tell you atonement crazy guilt ridden libtard weirdos something i wasnt a slave my parents werent slaves my grandparents werent slaves my great grandparents werent slaves my great great grandparents werent slaves to get to anyone in my family who might have been a slave you have to go back five generations i dont need your f king apology
2530755 america was not the only country in the history of mankind to practice slavery and blacks are not the only people to ever be held as slaves slavery is a human sin not a sin only of whites christians and or americans if blacks really cared about getting an apology for slavery if it really meant something to them why arent they demanding one from the arabs who traded in african slaves for over a thousand years too bad no one in the house had the cajones to bring up that bit of inconvenient history this whole apologizing for slavery con is just that a con a way to stoke the fire of white guilt which is one of the engines driving the lefts lust for big government

2530776 we started whats called a rapid response we quickly notified the local agencies erie county parks and theyve all been very supportive in our plans to go in and try to hand pull the water chestnuts
2530777 they form very dense colonies and you can see some of the colonies here its very difficult for a kayak or a coner to get through were kind of the early stages here in tonawanda creek but if we were to let this go another year or two it would continue to sprawl across the backwater and make if very hard to utilities
2530778 i think its a good idea id like to keep it clear through here id like to see them even dredge so boats can get through and make it more accessible
2530779 well i think its a good idea cause ive been paddling here for the past 15 years and we used to paddle around the island but the weeds have gotten so thick i never paddle there it gets to be too gross

2530801 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2530802 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2530803 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2530804 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2530805 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2530806 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2530807 are accused of criminal association with the aim of international terrorism and two of them also of serious fraud to fund terrorism

2530811 were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili

2530894 the american economy has often defied predictions of its demise it has done so again official figures published on thursday july 31st show that americas gdp rose at an annualised rate of 1 9 in the second quarter this would a respectable enough growth rate at the best of times that this was achieved despite the considerable handicaps of a badly damaged banking system a big jump in oil prices and the ongoing housing bust makes it remarkable
2530895 americas economy still on the right road jul 31st 2008 from economist com
2530896 the united states of america the worlds largest economy by some magnitude entered the new year in recession or teetering on the edge of one while data for early 2008 was inconclusive the us at least faces a sharp contraction in growth this year and even its first outright decline since 2001
2530897 recession was inevitable in an interview airing on cnbc yesterday afternoon although he said he didnt yet believe the us economy was in a recessionary state the economy is holding up better than he expected despite strong financial headwinds
2530898 nonfinancial corporate sector debt growth barely slowed in the first quarter debt has continued to rise relative to output but interest expenses remain extremely low at about 2 of output and other measures debt net worth and debt equity do not indicate excessive gearing that said the widening financing gap is spurring demand for loans real nonresidential investment spending growth has slowed it is little changed since early 2006 for these firms but at the same time internal cash flow has been falling in the first quarter the financing gap stood at 25 of capex it was a fairly similar 20 of capex in the first quarter of 2007 but 10 in the first quarter of 2006 and negative in the period of rapid domestic profits growth before then
2530899 and now the unavoidable bust of this bubble is going to force an effective nationalization of a good chunk of the us financial system as no one else but the government can do the job this is why the free market ideologues at the fed treasury and white house have now become especially after the bailout of fannie and freddies shareholders management and bondholders comrade paulson comrade bernanke and the bolshevik great leader bush but then their whole approach and ideology has always been not one of free market capitalism but rather one of privatizing gains and socializing the losses or socialism for wall street the rich and the well connected
2530900 leaving aside the fact that we are going to have a pretty nasty recession and international crisis the global economy is going to grow at a sustained rate once this downturn is over there are significant financial and economic problems in the u s and thats why im bearish about the u s but the emergence of china and india and other powers is going to shift global economics and politics radically and the world is going to be more balanced in the future rather than relying on one engine which has been the u s there are big issues ahead how do you integrate the 2 2 billion chinese and indians into the global economy there will be transitional costs and the displacement of workers both blue collar and white in the advanced economies but im quite bullish about the state of the global economy and im positive about the medium and long term
2530901 tenth and final point so what is left as the only solution is the outright formal or informal nationalization of the u s financial system that effective and creeping nationalization is already underway with the variety of actions that the fed and the u s treasury have taken and that we described above so this is the paradox of this u s administration it was so rabidly and ideologically free markets oriented and averse to any sensible regulation and supervision of the financial system that its policies of being asleep at the wheel caused the biggest asset bubble and credit bubble not just in mortgages in u s history and now the unavoidable bust of this bubble is going to force an effective nationalization of a good chunk of the u s financial system as no one else but the government can do the job this is why the free market ideologues at the fed treasury and white house have now become especially after the bailout of fannie and freddies shareholders management and bondholders comrade paulson comrade bernanke and the bolshevik great leader bush but then their whole approach and ideology has always been not one of free market capitalism but rather one of privatizing gains and socializing the losses or socialism for wall street the rich and the well connected so they will now get what they deserve and worked so hard to achieve a nationalization and bailout of the u s financial system
2530902 is a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother
2530903 the first significant thing about the world economy is the way in which global economic growth averaging out booms and recessions has not only declined from the golden age of capitalism in the 1950s and 1960s but also from the levels known in the late 1970s and 1980s
2530904 but if you look closely at the imf graph he provides it is clear that the growth rate in 2002 06 was no greater than that in 1970 73 with a much lower peak than in 1973 that is in the years that ended in the crisis which spelled the end of the long post war boom
2530905 three decades of stagnant real wages and increasing exploitation have substantially restored the rate of profit at the expense of workers this important fact should be acknowledged
2530906 the rise and fall of the corporate profit share global corporate profitability maintained its three decade secular trend upward in 2007 interrupted only by a few short lived setbacks as measured by the ratio of profits to nominal gdp the profits share among the major developed economies bottomed in the mid 1970s and slipped in the early 1980s but since then has moved from roughly 6 to over 9 last year in the us profit growth has outpaced nominal gdp growth over the past 25 years by a striking margin of 4 per annum
2530907 the past five years have seen a spectacular boom in global profits as of late 2007 profit margins in europe and the us were about 4 2 and 5 2 percentage points respectively above their 20 year average even in japan profit margins have moved well above their historical trend the biggest surge in profits over the past five years has been in emerging markets
2530908 global saving and investment as a percent of gdp fell sharply in the decade following the first oil price shock in the early 1970s but were then relatively stable until the late 1990s more recently however they again declined hitting historic lows in 2002 before modestly recovering over the past two years
2530909 in other words far from global accumulation showing a rising long term trend as kincaid contends it has been falling
2530910 the biggest investment boom in history is under way over half of the worlds infrastructure investment is now taking place in emerging economies where sales of excavators have risen more than fivefold since 2000 in total emerging economies are likely to spend an estimated 1 2 trillion on roads railways electricity telecommunications and other projects this year equivalent to 6 of their combined gdps twice the average infrastructure investment ratio in developed economies
2530911 profit margins proxied by the share of profits in gdp have risen steadily to record highs during the past 25 years across most developed economies boosted by a secular fall in the relative price of capital the cost to financing the acquisition of capital and the taxation of capital the relative price of capital goods has fallen due to technological progress as well as increased capital mobility competition and offshoring
2530912 the development of the productive power of labour in any one line of production e g the production of iron coal machinery in architecture etc which may again be partly connected with progress in the field of intellectual production notably natural science and its practical application appears to be the premise for a reduction of the value and consequently of the cost of means of production in other lines of industry e g the textile industry or agriculture this is self evident since a commodity which is the product of a certain branch of industry enters another as a means of production its greater or lesser price depends on the productivity of labour in the line of production from which it issues as a product and is at the same time a factor that not only cheapens the commodities into whose production it goes as a means of production but also reduces the value of the constant capital whose element it here becomes and thereby one that increases the rate of profit
2530913 now it is true that the first capitalists to innovate get excess profits but as the innovation is generalised across a sector profit rates fall
2530914 accumulation in china and to a lesser extent in india has been rising but the chinese economy today is not big enough to be a locomotive that can pull the rest of the world economy behind it
2530915 at current exchange rates the imf gave its gdp in 2006 as 2 600 billion just behind germany
2530916 asian domestic demand based on thirteen volume indicators is now larger than the us asia current dollar gdp is 59 of the us size but its true size is masked by cheap currencies and labour costs
2530917 justifies his claim by referring to a much hyped article by richard freeman which claims
2530918 cut the global capital labour ratio by just 55 to 60 percent of what it otherwise would have been
2530919 i would also argue that russia and china were part of the world system and in looking at its dynamics you have to take into account their fairly high rates of growth and accumulation 30 or 40 years ago
2530920 perhaps more importantly the figures for worldwide employment are fanciful in 2001 the non agricultural workforce of the developing and transition economies was 1 135 million 20 self employment accounted for a high proportion of these 32 percent in asia 44 percent in latin america and 48 percent in africa 21 those proportions have grown everywhere with urbanisation that reduces freeman and kincaids 1 5 billion potential new workers to about 700 million
2530921 industrial employment in china actually fell from 78 million in 1997 to 54 4 million in 2001 the fall was due to large scale redundancies in the old industrial sectors which was not compensated for by increased employment in newer sectors despite the massive investment taking place there
2530922 after joining the wto in 2001 about 150 million chinese joined the global workforce ninety seven million chinese two thirds of the us labour force have moved to urban areas since 2001 manufacturing and services have gained 88 million workers at the expense of agriculture which lost 47 million people
2530923 the additional capital formed in the course of accumulation attracts fewer and fewer labourers in proportion to its magnitude the old capital repels more and more of the labourers formerly employed by it
2530924 the organic composition of capital has been rising at a rapid rate in china
2530925 the rate of profit has been undergoing a long term fall
2530926 in any case profit margins and profit share are not the same as profitability recent studies of profitability in china show it as falling
2530927 how can we argue that rising corporate earnings are behind the increase in chinas overall saving rate when we saw that heavy industrial margins actually fell after 2003 the answer is that theres a very big difference between profit margins and total profits and that difference holds the key to understanding just how china could have developed such serious external imbalances over the past half decade margins rose from the end of the 1990s through the early part of this decade but have been flat or even falling since 2003 now consider the ratio of total industrial profits to gdp again a very different story indeed with the profit ratio exploding upward over the last five years
2530928 employment growth is only a little over 1 percent a year
2530929 with employed workforce only growing at about 1 percent a year despite the vast pools of rural labour
2530930 over 60 percent of the population was classified as rural by the 2000 census compared with 80 percent two decades ago
2530931 job growth since 1990 has taken place mainly in the urban areas overall job growth averaged just 1 percent since 1990 while jobs in urban areas increased at an average rate of 3 percent a year or 6 5 million a year over the same period job growth in urban areas was achieved despite layoffs at soes equivalent to more than 10 percent of the urban labor force
2530932 we begin with empirical evidence that the rate of growth of production has been falling
2530933 mostly as a result of a much better than expected trade report but also with support from significantly stronger than expected chain store sales we boosted our 2q gdp forecast to 2 4 from 1 7 an increase of more than three points in the past month
2530934 it now appears that us gdp expanded at a 2 5 3 0 pace whereas output contracted in the euro area and japan

2531069 a maioria dos homens n o est preparada para enfrentar esse diagn stico da incapacidade de ser pai
2531070 eles vivenciam isso de maneira muito solit ria at mesmo para n o gerar expectativa para n o lidar ainda com o preconceito e com certas brincadeiras em raz o de nossa sociedade ser muito machista e associar a fertilidade virilidade

2531077 confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2531078 the child is not the mere creature of the state
2531079 alternative to placing ones children in government schools which frequently push harmful political and social agendas
2531080 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
2531081 would undermine a practice that has been if not actively encouraged at least acknowledged and accepted by officials and the public for many years
2531082 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children
2531083 parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their childrens education

2531099 you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them
2531100 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

2531112 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2531113 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2531114 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2531115 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2531116 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2531117 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2531118 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2531119 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2531120 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2531121 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2531122 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2531123 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem

2531136 throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2531137 unequivocally held that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry
2531138 the attorney general did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry
2531139 since the superior court would not exercise its authority to protect voters against misleading language we will ask the appellate court to do so
2531140 its important that voters know exactly what this measure would do which is to change the constitution to eliminate a fundamental right the right to marry from one group of people

2531142 even as hopes are raised for crossrail it has been intimated that this would be at the expense of further support for the modernization of the tube network this is absurd both are necessary
2531143 ultimately the council must respect crossrails overarching duty to have regard to the paramount importance of the health and safety of crossrail passengers and workers which will dictate the location of such shafts
2531144 identification of the problems that crossrail will cause represents a broader view of the problems than the promoters of the current plan will claim it is time to go back to the drawing boards and come up with the plan that will be economically and environmentally sustainable a great deal of public money has already been wasted in the bureaucracy of the crossrail company they have not produced the optimum solution to the transport needs of london the reason why they have not done so includes the sabotage of the parliamentary scrutiny of the crossrail bill in terms of the devastating effects the crossrail hole plan will cause to the east end of london the social deficits will far outweigh any promised economic benefits for these parts with the world of finance behaving in the unpredictable way that it is bound to do the promoters big claim for crossrail being vital to make london a world class financial centre will most likely be another wasteful and diversionary exaggeration scrap the crossrail bill now use sustainable economic solution to the transport needs of london
2531145 plethora of changes that have taken place by the election commission to make election process in malaysia more free transparent ballot boxes indelible ink being used to make sure the voters do not vote twice trying to erase away from the electoral roll people who have passed on and things like that
2531146 we are very happy with the mayors decision but congestion is still a huge issue and the tram would just have made this worse
2531147 we have been held up a lot by the tram in making plans for improvements but we are now going to sit down with transport for london to work out a solution and we are aiming to solve this in months not years
2531148 there is also the problem of north south traffic flow in the area and we need to improve both hanger lane and the target roundabout
2531149 we are really pleased that we have passed this milestone
2531150 we will work as closely as we can with the council to help the council and work to make ealing broadway and especially west ealing better shopping centres that people want to travel to use
2531151 i have thought for years that the tram would never go ahead it was simply too expensive and too ambitious a project
2531152 all the time it remained a possibility it caused great anxiety to residents and businesses who saw their quality of life or livelihood at risk and prevented other solutions being looked at as all the energy was put into pro or anti tram campaigns
2531153 the whole sorry tale of the west london tram has been one of arrogance and a waste of money from the start
2531154 he admitted recently that this year will see total spending on the proposed tram scheme jump to 38million from 29million last year his squandering of tax payers money knows no bounds
2531155 mr livingstone is looking for a way out of the mess hes got himself into over the tram if he gets crossrail he can say hes pulled a rabbit out of the hat
2531156 if crossrail doesnt go ahead and the west london tram is brought back off the shelf then he can say he was forced into it by the prime minister gordon brown
2531157 a positive decision on crossrail will mean that substantially improved bus services become a practical alternative to a tram along the uxbridge road to meet the need for more public transport boost the local economy and to deal with rising congestion in the area
2531158 i am pleased that we have reached an agreement with ealing council to work together along these lines to deliver the best solution for people in this part of west london
2531159 the claim that crossrail as it is contained in the present crossrail bill in the uk house of commons is the right answer to the transport needs of london is a lie crossrail has never been the answer most serious students of economics have rejected the plug that crossrail is the panacea which ken livingstone has been claiming it to be crossrail is ill thought out it is wasteful already as a typical ken livingstone indulgin g stunt at extra cost to ordinary people in london the craze that livingstone is undergoing for crossrail will explode in his face when it is shown up for the con that it is livingstone is not behaving rationally on this what a comment on a man who has made a career at the expense of the people of london by claiming to be rational the waste of money livingstone typifies must be stopped ordinary people of and in london cant wait to be able to have our say on platforms that the bureaucratized office of mayor is automatically granted
2531160 the projects backers are likely to keep cost projections as low as possible to secure approval

2531209 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2531210 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
2531211 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2531212 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody
2531213 youre recruited in for that purpose as long as youre trusted each person has his function
2531214 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
2531215 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations
2531216 in the past all weve been able to do is what we call whack and stack
2531217 were not just pulling the plants were targeting mid level and upper management of these trafficking organizations
2531218 often times we have people who will lead us to these gardens
2531219 i want to state that the guys growing the marijuana are not the guys i went to college with
2531220 its something thats troubling for many of us in law enforcement
2531221 you have illegal criminal activity in the mountain regions not only destroying the natural beauty of the landscape but as well as the potential for this product to reach the children of this community
2531222 we can confirm the reports that an american couple and their chinese tour guide were attacked today by a chinese man from zhejiang province
2531223 ive seen reports that it didnt have any understandable motivation we are actively following up with the chinese authorities and the victims family u s embassy personnel responded to the scene and are at the hospital
2531224 the president of the united states is in china and he has been fully briefed on the incident and extends his condolences to the victims and their family
2531225 all i can say is its a very very sad day for everybody in the u s volleyball community
2531226 to find out full details and are ready to provide whatever assistance we can
2531227 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2531228 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2531229 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2531230 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2531231 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2531232 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2531233 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2531234 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2531235 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization

2531238 el objetivo es el mismo para todas es un deseo compartido sentimos que debemos hacer un gran torneo para lograr la medalla que nos falta sabemos que tenemos equipo para hacerlo y vamos con todas las expectativas despu s del sacrificio que estamos haciendo y las medallas que logramos anteriormente sin dudas la de oro es lo nico que nos dejar a conformes pero sabemos que es muy dif cil el resto de los pa ses se entrenaron de la misma forma as que pienso que traer una medalla de cualquier color ser a un orgullo grande para nosotroas y para la argentina
2531239 estamos entrenando mucho ajustando los ltimos detalles tanto de correcciones t cnicas como t cticas para llegar de la mejor manera estamos haciendo m s hincapi en la parte defensiva pero no s lo con las defensoras sino tambi n la presi n y los bloqueos de las delanteras
2531240 creo que est bien que las delanteras rotemos mucho en china hace demasiado calor en esta poca ya lo sufrimos cuando fuimos el a o pasado y se hace dif cil aguantar adentro de la cancha muchos minutos porque es sofocante el calor
2531241 la verdad es que estoy muy contenta de poder participar en un juego ol mpico creo que todav a no caigo de que voy a ir reci n cuanto este all y me de cuenta de lo que estoy viviendo voy a caer en la importancia y la magnitud que tiene un juego ol mpico
2531242 el objetivo principal es la medalla dorada pero creo que si dejamos todo jugamos bien y no se nos da conseguir una medalla no estar a mal quiz en el momento no estemos conformes pero despu s con el tiempo la terminas valorando
2531243 estamos demostrado que estamos entre los cuatro primeros pero en el torneo siempre tienen que ver la parte t cnica f sica t ctica y el momento en el que est el equipo esas dos semanas as que por lo pronto nuestras aspiraciones son para una medalla dorada el podio lo veo como algo que es real cuando uno est durante diez a os subiendo al podio o en su defecto logra un cuarto puesto ya deja de ser un sue o l gicamente no nos conformamos con un podio sino con el oro el lugar m s alto veremos que sucede
2531244 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate
2531245 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal
2531246 this evening a delegation of us eu osce and nato officials will be going to georgia to try to broker a ceasefire
2531247 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2531248 the russian president has specifically stressed that the only way out from the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2531249 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis
2531250 probabil c cel mai mare compliment pe care l poate face un b rbat unei femei afirm dr terzaghi este s i spun c o consider de teapt descurc rea elegant b rba ii cred c femeile vor doar s aud c sunt frumoase sau sexy i a a este dar ceea ce emo ioneaz nc i mai mult o femeie este s i dea seama c el admir inteligen a i rapiditatea ei n g ndire aceasta o face atunci s se simt c este respectat i considerat ca fiind egala b rbatului din punct de vedere intelectual
2531251 p na la urma ne dam seama ca analiz nd lucrurile cu detasare si luciditate un barbat obisnuit nu poate vreodata sa satisfaca total o femeie ale carei dorinte sunt cel mai adesea contradictorii si care n realitate nu stie ce vrea ea vrea ca el sa i poata oferi suficient de multe atunci c nd ea doreste sa fie dependenta de el sau vrea ca el sa n o controleze deloc atunci c nd ea are nevoie sa fie independenta ea vrea deseori un barbat care sa si dezvaluie toate emotiile chiar daca ea nca mai sovaie sa i se dezvaluie sexual

2531257 comedian bernie mac died early this morning from complications due to pneumonia his publicist confirmed
2531258 oh we are out of gas and need money for fuel
2531259 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2531260 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2531261 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2531262 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2531263 has been enthusiastically arming georgian troops from top to bottom
2531264 no moral right to teach others how to do things
2531265 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2531266 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2531267 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2531268 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2531269 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2531270 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2531271 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2531272 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2531273 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2531274 i was really chuffed wit that chord change c to a minor than a flat than another rising minor in a different key when i found the next e minor it was a real treat

2531278 la nueva constituci n es descentralizador por eso tenemos el apoyo de 23 prefectos de 190 alcaldes y del 100 por ciento de las juntas parroquiales eso demuestra que la nueva constituci n respeta las autonom as
2531279 los prefectos del pa s se han organizado para dar un profundo s en el pr ximo refer ndum porque ellos saben que escuchamos sus propuestas
2531280 la nueva constituci n fortalece las prefecturas establece claras competencias entre gobierno nacional regiones municipios y juntas parroquiales
2531281 el apoyo de los prefectos y los alcaldes del pa s demuestra qui n miente el alcalde de guayaquil jaime nebot est en un campa a por el no porque dice que la constituci n es centralista totalitarista que atenta contra la autonom a de los gobiernos seccionales y 23 de los 24 prefectos le est n diciendo lo contrario solo falta un nicol s lapentti que es social cristiano 190 alcaldes del pa s est n diciendo lo contrario y los directivos de las juntas parroquiales

2531284 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2531285 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2531286 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2531287 he sat back in his chair folded his arms and asked her to explain
2531288 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2531289 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2531290 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2531291 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2531292 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2531293 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2531294 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2531295 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2531296 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2531297 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2531298 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2531299 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2531300 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2531301 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2531302 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2531303 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2531304 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2531305 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2531306 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2531307 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2531308 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2531309 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2531310 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2531311 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2531312 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2531313 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2531314 i wont fight these men but i will find out who they were and why they knew him
2531315 if the national socialist white peoples party is no longer around then lets go out with a bang lets lynch every officer every attorney every judge every mh employee every person involved in this mans misfortune in california id rather lynch than use the 85 act because im a compassionate man
2531316 i will implement exactly what happened to him legally on all parties involved simply because we side with marathon runners in chicago not la hustlers
2531317 lets not fight legally in perverted la courts lets just go to war
2531318 weve needed to go to war since 2001 when the president sold this nation to foreign oil
2531319 yknow theres a part of me that believes that babu bush and the bush family plotted during that bizarre 1 month vacation in august of 2001 in saudi arabia if you wanted to kill the people against trevor buckingham then blowing up the world trade center was a perfect idea and if screwing us out of every dollar on top of that with skyrocketing foreign crude was the plan then he couldnt have done a better job
2531320 i think babu bush was the crude scam i think florida did the 9 11 attack at least thats where the pilots were from
2531321 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2531322 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2531323 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2531324 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2531325 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2531326 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2531327 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2531328 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2531329 he takes the base things of this world to confuse the wise
2531330 he took bread and broke it saying this is my body which is broken for you
2531331 by sacrificing whole burnt offerings and aromatic incense to god at the daily morning and evening prayers setting out fresh holy bread on a clean table and lighting lamps on the golden lamp stand every night we continue doing what god told us to do in the way he told us to do it but you have rid yourselves of him
2531332 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2531333 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2531334 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2531335 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2531336 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2531337 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2531338 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2531339 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2531340 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2531341 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2531342 the nazis had taken what had always been a rather clubbish overgrown track and field meet and turned it into the spectacle that even now we recognized as the modern olympics
2531343 the engineering design at the opening ceremony borrowed many of the latest space technologies they ensured the stable operation of thousands of devices
2531344 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2531345 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2531346 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2531347 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2531348 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2531349 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2531350 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2531351 who are open to doing something on the production side
2531352 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2531353 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2531354 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2531355 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2531356 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2531357 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2531358 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2531359 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2531360 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2531361 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2531362 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2531363 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2531364 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2531365 yes we are discontinuing this product as we look for other opportunities to service the consumer
2531366 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2531367 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2531368 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2531369 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2531370 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2531371 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2531372 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2531373 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2531374 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

2531406 congress is debating how to pay for the wind tax credits perhaps without realizing that over time wind farms pump more money into the us treasury and state and local coffers than they take out
2531407 our study shows that the wind farms more than pay for themselves through existing tax revenues so its time to renew the incentives immediately
2531408 too often politics rather than economics has shaped the debate about extending the production tax credit
2531409 ges new study identifying additional economic benefits of the wind industry should bring all parties together all supporting a proposition that is good for the environment good for the economy and even good for the federal treasury
2531410 congress repeated failure to act could derail the wind energy industry at the worst possible time for the economy placing 76 000 jobs and more than 11 5 billion in investment at risk

2531437 in malaysia religion is sensitive its not like in indonesia where they can marry freely like suharto hes muslim but his wife is christian in malaysia we have our federal constitution what they are doing is trying to destroy it
2531438 for me as a muslim i object to non muslims raising such a sensitive issue dont touch on the issue of religion thats a personal matter
2531439 its unfortunate that the forum coud not go on theres no conclusion for me its hanging
2531440 when you do a forum behind closed doors like this the people outside dont know who are on the panel they should have it outside like dataran merdeka
2531441 when you talk about people coming into islam there will be issues the people downstairs they dont know that
2531442 they make assumptions for those of us who are mature and educated we can think for ourselves but not everyone who came today are educated so they become very emotional because of this sensitive issue
2531443 so today there were political elements there were some people who did not give correct information
2531444 we can give our views on religion but the focus should not only be on islam
2531445 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2531446 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2531447 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2531448 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2531449 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2531450 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum its a real shame we had to stop the forum due to the advice from the police
2531451 it is not a question of freedom of speech for the last 50 years we are able to speak be it in this country or from outside the country we are democratic but remember we practice oriental democracy and not the western concept of democracy where anything and everything goes
2531452 so why do you have to bring up this sensitive issue of religion is the numbers of those that converted run into thousands or hundred of thousands no isnt it it just one of those case which happened to hit the headline of the medias
2531453 cant you see that it is not about numbers but about principles weather one person is killed or a hundred people are killed is not the question it is about a life that has been lost and nothing can bring it back
2531454 i repeat if you are not happy with the system here you are most welcome to migate to usa uk australia or why not go back to india or china and then see what happened to people like you
2531455 perhaps it can be said that seismic changes are taking place in malaysia because there has been no political renewal and special interest groups are entrenched perhaps the race based system which both lee and anwar challenged under which this group preserves its interests is no longer tenable in the age of the internet perhaps too many malays who support anwar now realise that malaysian malaysia or reformasi is what the country needs to lift the masses out of poverty not an astronaut or istanas if so then perhaps lee was right after all
2531456 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2531457 as the datuk seri anwar ibrahim saga unfolds before our eyes reflecting a similar episode 10 years ago it is strange that singaporeans do not experience a sense of deja vu not of the first episode but of aug 9 1965 while the absence of deja vu may be attributed to the passage of time of more than 40 years anyone who reads minister mentor lee kuan yews memoir a bestseller in singapore cannot fail to notice the parallels between lees battle against umno and anwars challenge against the same juggernaut
2531458 youre forgetting about the first umno president datuk onn jaafar who in the years leading up to independence from the british colonisers lets not forget of both our countries tried to persuade umno to become a party for malayans rather than just malays
2531459 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2531460 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2531461 it is something sad but happens in all divorce matters what i saw its not an issue of religion but how the people handled the matter the law is there the execution of the law is how its done per se its not an issue of conversion
2531462 but there is a twist in other court cases the pain and suffering is heard on both sides in this case because of the legal system where there are two jurisdictions the non converting spouse is confused and terrified thats why the heartbreak is exponentially increased in this situation
2531463 there is a problem and were trying to reconcile the differences trying to see whats the best way to move forward the problem will not go away unless we deal with it its a very human issue and as malaysians it is our responsibility to find ways to deal with it
2531464 apart from the legal issues we must focus on the humanitarian issues i think it is important to realise that saravanan subashini and shamala are not just names but real people
2531465 if the forum had followed its natural conclusion who knows mutual respect and sympathy for people could have bridged that yawning gap between our countrys two jurisdictions by debra chong
2531466 maybe the suspects thought ambiga still lives in the house
2531467 yes i used to live there it is shocking to think that merely discussing the plight of family members in a conversion situation can be so hazardous the act speaks for itself i need say no more
2531468 the guard discovered broken pieces of glass and a note and a police report on the incident was lodged at 7 10am the petrol bombs landed under the porch
2531469 i dont know where this all came from its hilarious its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff

2531486 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2531487 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2531488 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2531489 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc
2531490 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2531491 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2531492 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you

2531506 i am now writing to you as the ex md of wrapit plc as i predicted in my last email however i am still very committed to trying to achieve the best possible resolution for wrapit couples in this awful situation i had a meeting with the wrapit plc receivers kpmg on monday morning during which they informed me that they had met with hsbc and agreed that they would not fund wrapit to deliver your gifts to you but instead were going to go down the refund the gift purchasers route favoured by the bank regardless of the angst and inconvenience and embarrassment that this will cause to 2 000 couples and 60 000 gift buyers

2531531 key industry players are incorporating wireless radio communications capabilities into many new personal consumer products for example the new nike ipod sport kit from apple consists of two components a sensor and a receiver that communicate using a wireless radio protocol unfortunately there can be negative side effects associated with equipping these gadgets with wireless communications capabilities in the case of the nike ipod sport kit our research shows that the wireless capabilities in this new gadget can negatively impact a consumers personal privacy and safety as part of our research we built a number of surveillance tools that malicious individuals could use to track nike ipod sport kit owners our tools can track nike ipod sport kit owners while they are working out as well as when they are just casually walking around town a parking lot or a college campus the tracked individuals dont even need to have their ipods with them our research also shows that there exist simple cryptographic techniques that the nike ipod sport kit designers could have used to improve the privacy preserving properties of the nike ipod kit our work underscores the need for a broad public discussion about and further research on the privacy preserving properties of new wireless personal gadgets we stress however that there is no evidence that apple or nike intended for these devices to be used in any malicious manner additionally neither apple nor nike endorsed this study

2531584 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2531585 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2531586 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2531587 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
2531588 either way we need to keep every option open if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly

2531671 you know that a amp ws website is rootbeer com
2531672 no stupid i mean whats going to happen to us
2531673 i was just commenting on what wonderful technology youve given me to complete this mission
2531674 you were demoted for a reason i am sorry that you are paying the price for it now but we cannot afford to break the oath for anyone no matter what the circumstances
2531675 when ive convinced the baron to support us i want my old rank back
2531676 hopefully your mission will be a success and we can afford to get you better equipped
2531677 do not worry if the baron agrees to fight for us or even to simply offer financial backing then all will be forgiven
2531678 roger i am going to disengage from active control of your mind and continue meditating so i can shield you from the baron should he prove to be hostile call me if you run into any banshees or other fey folk we dont think the host could afford to supply fey mercs to keep the baron in check but seeing as they hold dublin and iona anything is possible ill keep a slight mental monitor going though so if i sense anything i can warn you
2531679 beat up one witch doctor and suddenly everythings a struggle
2531680 are you alright i am picking up a slight disturbance in your mental balance to put it plainly youre talking to yourself again
2531681 had to use an adreno buddy one of the ghouls got into the cookie jar and he had to be put down
2531682 roger just remember that if a lycanthrope or a wraith hears you coming you wont hear them coming
2531683 im gonna need a mental barrier against fear also increase my metabolism for the time being im gonna need to be a furnace in case it manages to touch me
2531684 you will not harm the baron i am loyal i am loyal i am loyaaaaallllll
2531685 im red ruin im trying to get him out of here
2531686 not host not the black but the red red dead youll be dead soon but maybe
2531687 no thank you i need to remain alive for now tell me where the baron is and i will do what i can to help him retake the castle
2531688 your fear is delicious let me taste it and i will tell
2531689 roger i am dropping the barrier take your voice box off line we dont want any errant screams attracting unwanted guests
2531690 now i have the strength my mind is lucid but not for long i can create a portal to where they are keeping the baron i cannot go the necromancers that keep him chained they will surely banish me then i could no longer serve
2531691 the pain of death is better than the pain of damnation we serve the baron because the alternative is far worse now come i have not much time before i lose my mind again
2531692 the king desires your power and he always gets what he wants maybe hell let me play with you a bit as a reward
2531693 weve danced this dance before i am not one to fall prey to your seduction and it is only your necromancers holding me here that stops me from killing you
2531694 baron it is only my necromancers here that stops the tainted king from simply twisting you to his bidding bowing to him of your own free will no matter how grudgingly will save you from a life of slavery i believe youll be much more useful if you can think for yourself and king kaledros trusts my judgement i know youll crack one day once the hunger becomes too much
2531695 you can smell my blood pulsing just beneath my skin if you give in now you can have me
2531696 i have always wanted to know what it felt like the kiss of the vampire the sweet pain of it
2531697 you have no idea what this is like you could not possibly want this
2531698 you brought a sonic blade yes give it to me
2531699 i am quite unimpressed with the state of my castle so you are going to do something for me you are to go to the tainted king kaledros and tell him that i find his so called army laughable
2531700 your siege was broken by no more than myself and one representative of the red ruin army
2531701 now that is what i call power you would never have caught me to begin with if you hadnt bribed that nixie to keep putting running water in my way then catching me out after sunrise you will pay now get out of my sight
2531702 the world is changing rhianna kasik i thought to remain out of it autonomous to the end i never wanted to be caught up in this war
2531703 just gerhalt will do we did share a meal together after all
2531704 what will become of my barony what will become of anyone who just wants to live what life they still have without all of this
2531705 over the next several weeks we will live together work together and train together this is an invaluable opportunity to get to know and understand one another to learn about different cultures and to build enduring relationships between professional militaries
2531706 the main task of georgian officers and soldiers is training this international exercise is a unique case as we have the possibility to hold trainings along with the representatives of the best army in the world for a month i think that we have created a new military school in georgia in recent years believe that what all of you have learned now will remain in our country and will be shared with the future generations that is why we have to train theoretically and practically as this is a precondition of victory the main thing is to get acquainted with independent decision making and free thinking
2531707 it is in a spirit of partnership for peace part of the nato program it was very rewarding for me to see the joint work of soldiers from different countries the command post trainings also went successfully ukrainian azeri armenian and georgian soldiers participated in the exercise jointly i believe that the exercise fulfilled its main purpose
2531708 information and communications technology law ictl unfortunately its behind a paywall but once i get things sorted on the site ill make some version of it available through self archiving
2531709 tidak akan terjadi hari kiamat hingga nabi isa alaihissalam turun ke bumi menjadi seorang hakim yang bijaksana dan pemimpin yang adil menghancurkan salib membunuh babi babi meletakkan upeti harta melimpah ruah hingga tidak ada seorangpun yang menerimanya
2531710 tidak akan terjadi hari kiamat hingga nabi isa turun ke bumi
2531711 akan turun nabi isa bin maryam membenarkan kerasulan muhammad atas agama yang dibawanya
2531712 tidak diterimanya upeti dari orang orang kafir dzimmi dan tidak diterima kecuali keislaman mereka barangsiapa dari mereka yang membayar jizyah maka tidaklah cukup dengannya dan tidaklah diterima kecuali keislaman atau dibunuh
2531713 maknanya adalah agama akan menjadi satu islam sehingga tidak tersisa seorang pun dari ahlul dzimmi orang kafir yang menyerahkan upeti sebagai jaminan keamanan yang membayar upeti
2531714 diseru kepada harta namun tidak ada seorang pun yang menerimanya
2531715 hingga keberadaan satu sujud lebih baik daripada dunia dan seisinya
2531716 keinginan manusia waktu itu kebanyakan dalam perkara shalat dan seluruh ketaatan karena pendeknya angan angan mereka disebabkan dekatnya hari kiamat serta sedikitnya keinginan mereka terhadap dunia disebabkan tidak butuhnya mereka akan hal itu
2531717 pahala terbaik yang diberikan kepada seseorang yang menjalankan shalat lebih utama ketimbang shadaqah mereka dengan dunia dan seisinya
2531718 keberadaan shalat lebih utama ketimbang shadaqah adalah disebabkan melimpahnya harta di waktu itu dan tidak bermanfaatnya harta tersebut sampai sampai tidak ada seorang pun yang mau menerimanya
2531719 tidak ada seorang pun dari ahli kitab kecuali akan beriman kepadanya isa sebelum kematiannya dan di hari kiamat nanti isa itu akan menjadi saksi terhadap mereka
2531720 hingga keberadaan satu sujud lebih baik daripada dunia dan seisinya
2531721 turunnya isa dan pembunuhan dajjal oleh beliau alaihissalam adalah perkara yang haq dan benar menurut ulama ahlus sunnah berdasarkan hadits hadits shahih dalam perkara ini tidak ada dasar baik akal maupun syariat yang menyanggahnya sehingga wajib untuk menetapkan pendapat tersebut
2531722 dimasukkannya hadits tersebut pada bab ini adalah sebagai isyarat bahwa hewan yang diperintahkan untuk dibunuh maka tidak diperbolehkan untuk diperjualbelikan juga diharamkan pemanfaatan dan memakannya serta bahwa babi adalah hewan yang najis hal ini ditinjau dari sisi bahwa sesuatu yang dapat diambil manfaatnya tidak disyariatkan untuk dirusak dibinasakan
2531723 dari bumi tanah itulah kami menjadikan kamu dan kepadanya kami akan mengembalikan kamu dan daripadanya kami akan mengeluarkan kamu pada kali yang lain
2531724 demikianlah sifat sifat mereka umat muhammad dalam taurat dan sifat sifat mereka dalam injil
2531725 tidaklah beliau mengusap seseorang yang berpenyakit kecuali sembuh tidak pula mayat kecuali hidup kembali
2531726 ibnu maryam dinamai al masih karena allah subhanahu wa taala menghapuskan dosa dosa darinya
2531727 dinamai demikian karena jibril alaihissalam mengusap beliau dengan barakah hal ini sebagaimana firman allah subhanahu wa taala
2531728 dan dia menjadikan aku sebagai seorang yang diberkati di mana saja aku berada
2531729 una mente vivace e tranquilla pu essere soddisfatta anche senza vedere nulla e non vede nulla che non le piaccia
2531730 atau siapakah yang memperkenankan doa orang yang dalam kesulitan apabila ia berdoa kepada nya dan siapakah pula yang menghilangkan kesusahan
2531731 janganlah kalian berlebih lebihan dalam memujiku sebagaimana orang orang nasrani berlebih lebihan dalam memuji isa bin maryam
2531732 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan agar mereka beribadah kepada ku
2531733 barang siapa menyerupai suatu kaum maka dia termasuk golongan mereka
2531734 dan di hadapan mereka orang orang yang telah mati ada barzakh dinding sampai hari mereka dibangkitkan
2531735 tidak ada seorang pun yang lebih dicintai oleh para sahabat daripada rasulullah shallallahu alahi wa sallam
2531736 kalau kami memiliki sesuatu tentu kalian tidak akan kesulitan mendapat jamuan
2531737 dari mana susu ini padahal kambing kambing kita tidak beranak dan di rumah tak ada kambing yang bisa diperah
2531738 tadi ada seseorang yang penuh berkah lewat di sini di antara ucapannya begini dan begini
2531739 aku yakin dialah salah seorang quraisy yang sedang mereka cari cari gambarkan padaku bagaimana ciri cirinya wahai ummu mabad
2531740 dia sungguh elok wajahnya berseri seri bagus perawakannya tidak gemuk tidak kecil kepalanya tampan rupawan bola matanya hitam legam bulu matanya panjang suaranya agak serak serak dan lehernya jenjang jenggotnya lebat matanya jeli bagaikan bercelak alisnya panjang melengkung dengan kedua ujung yang bertemu rambutnya hitam legam bila diam dia tampak berwibawa bila berbicara dia tampak ramah amat bagus dan elok dilihat dari kejauhan amat tampan dipandang dari dekat manis tutur katanya tidak sedikit bicaranya tidak pula berlebihan ucapannya bak untaian marjan perawakannya sedang tidak dipandang remeh karena pendek tak pula enggan mata memandangnya karena terlalu tinggi dia bagai pertengahan antara dua dahan dia yang paling tampan dan paling mulia dari ketiga temannya yang lain dia memiliki teman teman yang mengelilinginya bila dia berbicara mereka mendengarkan ucapannya baik baik bila dia memerintahkan sesuatu mereka dengan segera melayani dan menaati perintahnya dia tak pernah bermuka masam dan tak bertele tele ucapannya
2531741 demi allah dia pasti orang quraisy yang sedang mereka cari cari aku bertekad untuk menemaninya dan sungguh aku akan melakukannya jika kudapatkan jalan untuk itu
2531742 tidakkah kamu perhatikan bagaimana allah telah membuat perumpamaan kalimat yang baik seperti pohon yang baik akarnya teguh dan cabangnya menjulang ke langit pohon itu memberikan buahnya pada setiap saat dengan seizin rabb nya allah membuat perumpamaan perumpamaan itu untuk manusia supaya mereka selalu ingat
2531743 wahai ruwaifi barangkali engkau akan menjalani kehidupan yang panjang kabarkanlah kepada manusia bahwa barangsiapa yang memintal jenggotnya menggantungkan jimat atau beristinja bersuci dengan kotoran hewan dan tulang maka sesungguhnya muhammad berlepas diri darinya
2531744 ketika rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam terkena sakit yang menyebabkan beliau tidak dapat bangun
2531745 allah telah mengutuk orang orang yahudi dan nasrani karena mereka telah menjadikan kubur nabi nabi mereka sebagai masjid
2531746 jika tidak karena itu tentu kuburan beliau akan ditempatkan di baqie namun rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam khawatir akan dijadikan sebagai masjid
2531747 ya allah janganlah engkau menjadikan kuburku berhala yang disembah sungguh besar kemurkaan allah terhadap kaum yang menjadikan kuburan nabi nabinya sebagai masjid
2531748 dan ibrahim telah mewasiatkan ucapan itu kepada anak anaknya demikian pula yaqub
2531749 hai anak anakku sesungguhnya allah telah memilih agama ini bagimu maka janganlah kalian mati kecuali dalam keadaan islam
2531750 dan ingatlah ketika luqman berkata ke pada anaknya di waktu ia memberi pela jaran kepadanya
2531751 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus para rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan
2531752 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus nuh kepada kaumnya lalu ia berkata
2531753 hai bani israil beribadahlah kepada allah rabb ku dan rabb mu
2531754 dan kami telah mengutus kepada kaum aad saudara mereka hud
2531755 hai kaumku beribadahlah kepada allah sekali kali tidak ada sesembahan bagimu selain dari nya maka mengapa kamu tidak bertaqwa kepada nya
2531756 dan kami telah mengutus kepada kaum tsamud saudara mereka shaleh
2531757 hai kaumku beribadahlah kepada allah sekali kali tidak ada sesembahan bagimu selain nya sesungguhnya telah datang bukti yang nyata kepadamu dari rabb mu unta betina allah ini menjadi tanda bagimu maka biarkanlah dia makan di bumi allah dan janganlah kalian mengganggunya biarkanlah dia makan di bumi allah dan janganlah kalian mengganggunya dengan gangguan apapun yang karenanya kamu akan ditimpa siksaan yang pedih
2531758 beribadahlah kepada allah dan tidak ada bagi kalian sesem bahan kecuali dia
2531759 dan kami telah mengutus kepada pendu duk madyan saudara mereka syuaib
2531760 hai kaumku beribadahlah kepada allah sekali kali tidak ada sesembahan bagimu selain nya sesungguhnya telah datang kepadamu bukti yang nyata dari rabb mu maka sempurnakanlah takaran dan timbangan dan janganlah kalian kurangkan bagi manusia barang barang takaran dan timbangannya dan janganlah kalian membuat kerusakan di muka bumi sesudah rabbmu memperbaikinya yang demikian itu lebih baik bagimu jika betul betul kamu orang orang yang beriman
2531761 manhaj al anbiyaa fi dawati ilallah fiihi al hikmah wal aql
2531762 niscaya allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman di antaramu dan orang orang yang berilmu beberapa derajat
2531763 oleh karena itu kita dapati orang orang yang berilmu selalu menyandang pujian setiap nama mereka disebut pujian pun tercurah untuk mereka ini merupakan wujud diangkatnya derajat mereka di dunia adapun di akhirat akan menempati derajat yang tinggi lagi mulia sesuai dengan apa yang mereka dakwahkan di jalan allah subhanahu wa taala dan realisasi dari ilmu yang mereka miliki
2531764 maka bertanyalah kepada orang orang yang berilmu jika kalian tidak mengetahui
2531765 selagi para ulama masih ada umat pun masih dalam kebaikan para setan dari kalangan jin dan manusia tidak akan leluasa untuk menyesatkan mereka karena para ulama tidak akan tinggal diam untuk menerangkan jalan kebaikan dan kebenaran sebagaimana mereka selalu memperingatkan umat dari jalan kebinasaan
2531766 dahulu aku membuka lembaran lembaran kitab di hadapan al imam malik dengan perlahan lahan agar tidak terdengar oleh beliau karena rasa hormatku pada beliau yang sangat tinggi
2531767 maka wajib bagi seluruh kaum muslimin setelah mencintai allah subhanahu wa taala dan rasul nya untuk mencintai orang orang yang beriman sebagaimana yang telah disebutkan di dalam al quran terkhusus para ulama sang pewaris para nabi yang diposisikan oleh allah subhanahu wa taala bagaikan bintang bintang di angkasa yang jadi petunjuk arah di tengah gelapnya daratan maupun lautan kaum muslimin pun sepakat bahwa para ulama merupakan orang orang yang berilmu dan dapat membimbing ke jalan yang lurus
2531768 menggunjing ulama melecehkan dan menjelek jelekkan mereka merupakan jenis ghibah dan namimah yang paling berat karena dapat memisahkan umat dari ulamanya dan terkikisnya kepercayaan umat kepada mereka jika ini terjadi akan muncul kejelekan yang besar
2531769 mereka berkata wahai musa kami sekali kali tidak akan memasukinya menaklukkan palestina selagi mereka orang orang yang gagah perkasa itu ada di dalamnya maka dari itu pergilah kamu bersama tuhanmu dan berperanglah kamu berdua sesungguhnya kami hanya duduk menanti di sini saja
2531770 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mendatangkan al kitab taurat kepada musa dan telah kami susulkan berturut turut sesudah itu rasul rasul dan telah kami berikan bukti bukti kebenaran mukjizat kepada isa putra maryam dan kami memperkuatnya dengan ruhul qudus malaikat jibril apakah setiap kali datang kepada kalian seorang rasul membawa sesuatu ajaran yang tidak sesuai dengan keinginan kalian lalu kalian bersikap angkuh maka beberapa orang di antara mereka kalian dustakan dan beberapa orang yang lain kalian bunuh
2531771 katakanlah mengapa kalian dahulu membunuh nabi nabi allah jika kalian benar benar orang yang beriman
2531772 lalu ditimpakanlah kepada mereka orang orang yahudi nista dan kehinaan serta mereka mendapat kemurkaan dari allah hal itu terjadi karena mereka selalu mengingkari ayat ayat allah dan membunuh para nabi yang memang tidak dibenarkan demikian itu terjadi karena mereka selalu berbuat durhaka dan melampaui batas
2531773 dan mereka berkata hati kami tertutup tetapi sebenarnya allah telah mengutuk mereka karena keingkaran mereka maka sedikit sekali dari mereka yang beriman
2531774 tidak ada seorang pun dari ahlul bidah di dunia ini kecuali benci terhadap ahlul hadits ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
2531775 tanda dan ciri mereka yang utama adalah permusuhan penghinaan dan pelecehan yang luar biasa terhadap pembawa hadits nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ulama
2531776 ciri ciri ahlul bidah adalah melecehkan ahlul atsar ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
2531777 ciri utama zanadiqah orang orang yang menampakkan keislaman dan menyembunyikan kekafiran adalah menjuluki ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dengan hasyawiyyah dalam rangka menggugurkan hadits hadits rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ciri utama jahmiyyah adalah menjuluki ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dengan musyabbihah ciri utama qadariyyah adalah menjuluki ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dengan mujbirah ciri utama murjiah adalah menjuluki ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dengan mukhalifah dan nuqshaniyyah ciri utama syiah rafidhah adalah menjuluki ahlus sunnah dengan naashibah
2531778 aku melihat julukan julukan yang ditujukan kepada ahlus sunnah itu justru tertuju kepada ahlul bidah sendiri dan tidak satupun dari julukan julukan tersebut yang mengena karena keutamaan dan jaminan dari allah subhanahu wa taala
2531779 perhatikanlah bagaimana mereka membuat perbandingan perbandingan tentang kamu lalu sesatlah mereka mereka tidak sanggup mendapatkan jalan untuk menentang kerasulanmu
2531780 yang demikian itu dalam rangka untuk memisahkan umat dari ulamanya sehingga bila berhasil akan mudah bagi mereka ahlul bidah untuk menyusupkan berbagai kerancuan pemikiran dan kesesatan yang dapat menyesatkan umat dan memecah belah kekuatan mereka itulah misi yang mereka inginkan maka hendaknya kita waspada
2531781 wahai rabb kami ampunilah kami dan saudara saudara kami yang telah beriman lebih dulu dari kami dan janganlah engkau biarkan kedengkian terhadap orang orang yang beriman bercokol pada hati kami yaa allah sungguh engkau maha penyantun lagi maha penyayang
2531782 dan saat ini sangat disayangkan kita tidak mempunyai ulama kecuali orang orang yang memahami islam dengan pemahaman tradisional
2531783 kita tidak inginkan barisan dari ulama mummi jasadnya ada namun pola pikirnya kuno pen
2531784 dia ibarat perpustakaan berjalan namun cetakan lama yang perlu direvisi
2531785 orang ini tidak mampu menjawab syubhat yang dilancarkan oleh musuh musuh allah bahkan tidak ada kesiapan untuk mendengarkan syubhat tersebut
2531786 di dunia islam saat ini sangat banyak lembaga lembaga yang jauh dari agama dan terkadang lembaga tersebut bertanggungjawab tentang fatwa atau urusan agama namun yang dilakukan sebatas pengumuman masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan
2531787 berbagai insiden yang terjadi di teluk arab semakin membongkar berbagai macam penyakit tersembunyi yang diidap oleh kaum muslimin hingga perkataannya dan membongkar pula tentang tidak adanya referensi ilmiah ulama yang benar dan dapat dipercaya oleh kaum muslimin
2531788 ya mereka kurang di dalam memahami waqi fenomena kekinian mereka punya sekian banyak kekurangan yang harus kita lengkapi bukan kita lebih utama dari mereka tetapi kita hidup dan bergelut dengan berbagai macam persoalan kekinian sedangkan mereka menyikapi persoalan persoalan tersebut dengan hukum yang tidak sesuai dengan zaman yang mereka hidup padanya
2531789 dan sebagian dari ulama tersebut mulai menerima kritikan ini karena mereka sudah jompo atau telah memasuki fase
2531790 dan jenis lain adalah orang orang yang berbuat tanpa ada rasa takut yang selalu menyesuaikan sikap sikapnya dengan sikap para tuannya ketika para tuan ini meminta bantuan pasukan dari amerika untuk menghadapi saddam husain sosialis pen dengan sigap para budak tersebut mempersiapkan dalil dalil yang membolehkan perbuatan itu dan ketika para tuan berseteru dengan iran yang berpaham sesat syiah rafidhah pen maka para budak itu pun selalu menyebut nyebut kejahatan dan kesesatan syiah rafidhah
2531791 perbudakan di masa lalu cukup sederhana karena si budak hanya mempunyai tuan secara langsung adapun hari ini perbudakan cukup rumit dan rasa heranku tak pernah sirna terhadap orang orang yang berbicara tentang tauhid namun mereka budak budak budak budaknya budak dan tuan terakhir mereka adalah seorang nashrani yakni george bush pen
2531792 adapun pendapatku secara pribadi sesungguhnya asy syaikh ibn baz telah sampai pada tingkat pikun dungu serta lemah yang sangat

2531825 if they stick in a moratorium to prevent us getting oil and gas from our outer continental shelf to help the american people they put that in to a continuing resolution to keep the government going im sorry ive got to keep the american people going who cant afford these gas prices im voting against it no matter what bill they stick it in if its to honor my mother my mother would understand rest her soul i would vote against it we have got to take this stand
2531826 i think we really want to keep that ball in the court that it belongs in the democrats they have to proactively try to maintain these moratoriums on oil shale and on deep water drilling as their price to keep the government going i think theyre the ones that have to be answerable for that im assuming at this point that those things are over on september the 30th the american people should demand that they be over and the president should be moving forward as if the leasing process could begin on october 1
2531827 i did a tele townhall in may and all i heard about was energy prices and since may thats all its been i get no questions on immigration i get no questions on national defense it is all about the price of energy because i live in a part of the state where you gotta drive some distance to get anywhere and it has affected everyone up and down the line from the retiree to the young family to the small business everyone is affected
2531828 utterly unyielding in attitude or opinion in spite of all appeals urgings etc
2531829 its fine with me as long as its condition based
2531830 the agreement im sure will be condition based and the fact is that we have succeeded and were winning and whenever you win wars the troops come home
2531831 the major point here is that senator obama said it wouldnt work couldnt work and still refuses to acknowledge that it has succeeded
2531832 senator obama believes it is not in our strategic interest to have an open ended commitment in iraq that is why he has advocated for a safe and responsible draw down over 16 months
2531833 a clear time frame is the best way to pressure the iraqis to make the political concessions necessary to stabilize iraq for the long term
2531834 my mission and my job as president of the united states one of them will be to make sure that every market in the world is open to your products
2531835 his strengths are his experience his understanding of the military
2531836 thats a public service announcement its not an energy policy
2531837 i went to kind of a small high school and i was a tailback in football
2531838 i was big for a running back and thats what they told me when teams recruited me i got recruited from some schools for football and they had me out pass blocking as a lineman and i was like i dont know any of this
2531839 i got recruited for football as a junior in high school and had not even played varsity baseball yet
2531840 i tried to string out the recruiting process for football as i was recruited by mostly in state schools and a little bit in illinois but mostly big ten schools you try to string them out as an in state kid and they say see you later then we are going to find somebody better than you in texas it is a tough deal as you have to be totally into it i think if i would have played football i would have been miserable anyway college football thats a job baseball this is just a fun game
2531841 it was tough to leave my teammates there and i loved my coaching staff but not winning a lot it is easier to leave than if it were a successful program it was definitely tough and a big risk for a college kid to make it would be easier to lock up your long term future by getting your degree but the pull is so hard to shy away from
2531842 after my college season i played in the northwoods league which is a wood bat league
2531843 before i went there the indians told me it would be as much like pro ball as any summer league you can go to and it was as the games the bus trips the stadiums are all just like a minor league atmosphere the switch was not too hard other than the competition is far better here just the grind of things i was pretty ready for it
2531844 i mean you get tired physically but everybody gets tired physically it is not like one team is more tired than the next team it is pretty much whatever team deals with it better than the rest it will be interesting come playoff time who is still around who is still healthy and who is still ready to compete and into it
2531845 dallas is a guy that pounds the zone with his fastball and with his fastball being as explosive as it is at 92 to 95 mph at times he is going to be able to have a good year in this league
2531846 i think right now what he needs to work on is tightening up his slider and repeating his delivery he really still has some delivery stuff he needs to adjust but for his progress up to this year he is really having a great year he has been in very tight situations and that is a very valuable guy for your team he has a major league body and he also has a split finger that could develop into an out pitch at the higher levels
2531847 the slider is a work in progress thats for sure
2531848 it has always been in my arsenal but it has never been a commanding pitch where hitters would even fear it at all my splitter is good and it is an out pitch but having a slider that i can throw for strikes in any count would help my other pitches be much better
2531849 some people have a natural breaking ball like paolo espino who has an absolutely incredible natural curveball
2531850 a guy like me i dont have the arm action to throw a natural slider so i really have to work on getting out in front and ruben has just set me up with a good grip that feels natural to me that i can get out in front and get downspin as opposed to side spin to get some depth and some tilt to it rather than a drifting pitch i know very little about it and i am just doing whatever ruben tells me to he is very knowledgeable so i am just trusting him

2531854 i felt like a professional comedian because i had everybody in stitches for several minutes
2531855 this is an invaluable resource that i would recommend to anyone that is involved in a wedding it saved me hours of time and made it clear in my head what i was actually required to do
2531856 i basically learned everything i needed to know from your site
2531857 everyone came up to me during the reception to tell me what a wonderful speech that was
2531858 a state like florida would get a disproportionate share because of its high foreclosure rate
2531859 planets that will be converted into generic nano engineered stuff known as computronium and assembled into matrioshka brains or m brains which are built round a star to collect all its radiant energy and each shell would be filled with intelligence using waste energy from the one beneath
2531860 my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that

2531865 there can be no racial healing without dialogue without ending the white silence on racism there can be no reconciliation without honest and frank conversation
2531866 address the radical contradiction that racism creates for christian theology and need to write about slavery colonialism segregation and the profound cultural link these horrible crimes created between white supremacy and christianity

2531879 en el referendo revocatorio del 10 de agosto la confirmaci n del mandato del presidente evo morales es fundamental para la continuidad de los procesos de liberaci n en bolivia y en toda am rica latina
2531880 en respuesta las oligarqu as atrincheradas en algunos gobiernos regionales apoyadas por el gobierno de los estados unidos lanzaron una campa a con el pretexto de las autonom as regionales buscando la separaci n de varios departamentos en relaci n al estado boliviano como forma de impedir la aplicaci n de las pol ticas del gobierno central
2531881 con ese objetivo no dudaron en promover el racismo y la violencia contra las comunidades ind genas y campesinas y con movilizaciones de grupos paramilitares autonominados

2531890 my office strongly supported the law change to section 59 because all the evidence points to physical punishment as ineffective and in the hands of some people dangerous
2531891 make any comment that is adverse to a person if the commissioner has not given the person an opportunity to be heard
2531892 the incident was such that at least two bystanders contacted police one was a teacher and the other an off duty police officer and if they were concerned then i believe there was something to be concerned about
2531893 the most common cause of death by child abuse in this country is from injuries to the head this should never be taken lightly
2531894 a comment by the childrens commissioner cindy kiro commending the public for intervening in a fathers discipline of his child is a worrying trend that concerns many good parents
2531895 i agree all the facts are not known however lets put our self in the fathers shoes for a moment
2531896 here is a father taking time out to take his two young sons on a biking outing apparently a regular occurrence this surely is to be commended the younger son 2 years has an accident beside the roadway and is hurt the second son 3 years does not understand the seriousness of the situation and the father being responsible for both of his sons handles the situation in a manner he felt was appropriate for the safety of both boys
2531897 there is genuine fear and uncertainty amongst parents who have used traditional methods of corrective discipline such as smacking
2531898 the reality is we either encourage parents to discipline their children while they are young or sadly as in the case of too many new zealanders the state will discipline them when they are older personally i prefer loving parental correction rather than this over the top anti parent legislation we currently have to deal with
2531899 she looked beautiful her dress is gorgeous the ring is gorgeous they cant be happier

2531909 as were all painfully aware the housing correction has had a significant impact on the us economy
2531910 in the midst of the single largest decline in real estate values since the great depression
2531911 todays challenging economic environment suggests the housing market is far from stabilising we now think were about halfway through the peak to trough decline
2531912 while we do not expect to draw on any of the new backstops going forward they provide important sources of reassurance and potential support in the event that the housing market declines even further than anticipated
2531913 what will be interesting to see are the terms investors will demand in return for buying into freddie macs proposed 5 5bn stock offering
2531914 we have only just received correspondence from the secretary of state on this issue and will want to consider carefully all of the points raised
2531915 weve got to keep it moving but were pretty confident well be able to see this through to a referendum
2531916 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand is in the name of aucklander sheryl savill a mother of two who works with focus on the family and whose husband is a policeman
2531917 should the government give urgent priority to understanding and addressing the wider causes of family breakdown family violence and child abuse in new zealand
2531918 theres been times when weve cooked a healthy meal and plonked it down in front of the children and then seen them eat nothing and worry theyre going to wake up in the night and think itd be easier to cook them another meal now
2531919 a quarter of our members have left because of section 59 i could rattle off about 10 in south auckland i know of many many caregivers who have been longstanding caregivers but wont do caregiving any more its too dangerous
2531920 these kids are really hard they just dont care who they hurt and you need really special people to take them on if you have a kid that is yelling and screaming at you what are you supposed to do
2531921 it comes down to the whole area of professionalism and payments because both couples have to go to work to earn the money to pay the mortgage
2531922 all that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing
2531923 the most common cause of death by child abuse in this country is from injuries to the head this should never be taken lightly
2531924 the police officers didnt know and i said to them well youve just told me what i did was wrong so you must know what is right
2531925 it needs to be on record that i disciplined him for something he deserved not that im a child beater theres an irony there that they can spray taser or shoot me but i cant flick my son in the ear to stop him getting run over at an intersection
2531926 they were going to arrest me and were trying to ascertain whether it was safe for the kids to go home with me
2531927 the arrestee in the narcotics case had apparently legally changed his name to almighty allah and has convictions under this new name
2531928 seth just wanted to go on riding he didnt realise the seriousness of it with the youngest one slipping in and out of consciousness
2531929 so i turned to seth and flicked him on the ear and told him to shut up while we fixed up the young one
2531930 they were going to arrest me and were trying to ascertain whether it was safe for the kids to go home with me
2531931 when i say stop to the kids they have got to stop
2531932 i said to the cops that i need to impress upon him seth what he did was wrong and i need to impress it on him straight away and asked them how they suggested i do it
2531933 they didnt know and i said to them well youve just told me what i did was wrong so you must know what is right
2531934 it needs to be on record that i disciplined him for something he deserved not that im a child beater
2531935 theres an irony there that they can spray taser or shoot me but i cant flick my son in the ear to stop him getting run over at an intersection
2531936 it says every parent is justified in using force if its reasonable in the circumstances
2531937 thats the problem with this law its lost the common sense element its a feel good law change but has done nothing to protect kids who are actually being abused
2531938 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him
2531939 its a very sad moment for everyone wearing red white and blue
2531940 just sad they kind of informed us that it was an isolated event but whenever something that tragic happens your initial feeling is to want to be a little bit more secure wherever you go
2531941 they told us it was totally random and doesnt have anything to do with the olympics or america
2531942 they said there isnt a lot of crime in beijing and its rare for something like this to happen we hope thats true its so sad that it happened and we feel awful for the family
2531943 if anything happens to any one of us then were all touched by it were definitely going to be a lot more conscious of being safe
2531944 feel any less safe because of this i felt very safe im going to continue to feel very safe in china
2531945 you have to be careful anytime you travel whether youre in usa or any country around the world it will just keep people thinking that way
2531946 our females tend to stay close to the athletes village and in a more secure environment its not just for this type of thing they are a little more protected when youre on billboards in the community youre a litle more recognizable
2531947 but i think the chinese are saying its an isolated incident and you just have to feel like its an isolated incident
2531948 they did not voice any concerns to me doesnt mean they dont have them
2531949 we have not yet been given where to go and where not to go
2531950 are we concerned about our safety i dont think so the security seems pretty tight it seems safe
2531951 absolutely nothing went our way so were going to have to take care of business

2531955 we dont smack our kids or if we have in the past it has been minor and this incident did not occur i informed the officers accordingly they insisted that they needed to see my daughter i informed them that she was now with her father as we share custody i gave them full contact details they told me they would have to go around there to check she was ok
2531956 i have found the whole episode to be extremely distressing i felt completely humiliated to literally be accused of child abuse and have now found it hard to sleep at night at it has upset me so much how i look after and care for my children is being questioned on hearsay i am now a guilty person this new law is ending up with a lot of good innocent parents being wrongfully accused this law needs to be changed
2531957 you cant make me do anything you cant smack me

2532006 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2532007 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here

2532009 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2532010 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too

2532025 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week

2532159 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2532160 it is always extremely alarming when a neighboring country is in turmoil you cannot be democratic for the outside world and undemocratic in your own country therefore when the country is in such a situation the only way to consolidate the nation is a small victorious war
2532161 i cannot rule out the possibility that georgia might resort to such a conflict
2532162 a war in the caucasus might start in regions either in south ossetia or in abkhazia
2532163 we are used to the fact that people in both sukhumi and tskhinvali talk about war all the time however talk is one thing and reality is quite another
2532164 in general i have to say that kokoyty is playing a very dangerous game after all south ossetia joining russia is
2532165 attract the very best teachers to delawares public schools and to create working conditions and classroom environments for those teachers that will nurture real success for students
2532166 will this cost money of course it will but i expect to use some of the savings that we realize from the plans i proposed several weeks ago reducing the percentage of education funds spent outside the classroom to fund this initiative
2532167 we spend millions of dollars a year trying to lure new businesses to our state it is about time that we realized that if we want to recruit new businesses we can do that best by recruiting excellent new teachers strong schools are the backbone of a strong state economy
2532168 first and foremost they worked with teachers from the outset in designing their programs there were disagreements to be sure but teachers were involved in the discussions from day one the second common denominator is that the new compensation system was accompanied by significant new funds that was the tradeoff higher compensation for greater accountability
2532169 third several of the programs have significant financial incentives for teachers who are willing to teach in challenging schools finally the rewards are based upon student improvement in the course of a school year and they are based upon testing methods that have earned parents and teachers trust
2532170 if we take the steps i discussed several weeks ago to direct money into the classroom and make public education a priority in the state budget we should be able to do many of these things without imposing new burdens on taxpayers
2532171 and if we do these four things we will have put in place the most important building blocks to making delawares schools the best in america

2532176 why not run rancheros and el caminos thats a car and a truck
2532177 from an owners perspective you can run a truck on about half of what you can run a nationwide budget on maybe a little less than that actually
2532178 for the manufacturers trucks make sense just for the fact that they sell more trucks than they do anything else
2532179 weve been fortunate to make it make sense and be a part of the series and look forward to being a part of the series for a while to come i think theres a lot of things in motion for the nationwide series to take place as we go forward and i think collectively as owners nascar everybody is working in the same direction to make that better
2532180 what were trying to do is focus in and find an appropriate location in the state of maine that will have minimal impact on the fisheries and the environment

2532189 once upon a time god made this big garden and told adam and eve to have lots of fun and gave them just one rule dont ever eat the apples but then a talking snake came and told eve to eat the apple so she took a bite and then gave some to adam well god got really mad at them and kicked them out of the garden and then they had to live in a world where they could never have any fun and it wasnt very good at all
2532190 so the moral of the story is to not eat apples thats good because i got me some cookies
2532191 who am i where did i come from where am i going

2532195 parents who have lost children are grieving and calling for the government to do something this is what they government wanted all the time they need to justify their actions and some of us are doing that
2532196 too many of our young people are being excluded from education fast tracked into adulthood and then warehoused by the government
2532197 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2532198 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2532199 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2532200 excuse me i just had to tell you my brother here things youre like the most beautiful girl hes ever seen
2532201 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2532202 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2532203 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2532204 i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order
2532205 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2532206 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2532207 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2532208 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers
2532209 im so tired i just cant do what i used to do
2532210 id love to go but honestly i just dont have the energy
2532211 the single biggest complaint i hear from my patients day in and day out is fatigue
2532212 if youre continually logging in just 5 or 6 hours a night its going to catch up with you no matter your age
2532213 if your fatigue goes on for more than a week and there is no explanation for feeling tired then yes see your doctor
2532214 if you are in your reproductive years and particularly if you experience heavy menstrual cycles have fibroid tumors or uterine polyps or if youve recently given birth the blood loss may have caused you to develop anemia a leading cause of fatigue in women
2532215 i believe that undiagnosed thyroid disorder is one of the major female health problems in this country i think it is even more widespread than anyone realizes
2532216 not every woman has obvious symptoms of a uti some have no symptoms or mild symptoms that go unnoticed except for the fatigue
2532217 any attempts to solve the problem by increasing caffeine intake causes the fatigue to worsen
2532218 evidence indicates food intolerance as a cause of fatigue and even suggests that fatigue may be an early warning sign of food intolerance
2532219 this doesnt mean that you should panic every time you yawn
2532220 most of the time fatigue is not the first sign of heart disease and its usually linked to something far less serious
2532221 kalo ente dah tahu isinya lantas apa apa itu bakal ngerubah keadaan
2532222 human beings are funny they long to be with people they love but refuse to admit openly some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear fear that maybe their feeling may not be recognized or even worse returned but one thing about human being that puzzles me the most is their conscious effort to be remotely connected with their object of affection even if it kills them slowly within
2532223 if youre waiting for a sign this is it do it it will be amazing

2532242 de levende geschiedenis zoals deze in het zzm werd beoefend gaf een beeld dat in de verste verte niet klopte met de toenmalige realiteit het stinkt er niet ga effe naar de traanrokerij mensen hebben er geen honger toch doet het pannenkoekenrestaurant goede zaken men ziet geen ziekte oud leprozenhofje missen we inderdaad geen dood ik heb fotos van zerken geen armoede entree 12 50 p p en geen rotte tanden ridderikhofs theatertandenzwart hij noemt het zzm een sentimentele platte ansichtkaart met de pretentie van geschiedenis maar behalve de stenen het hout en de dakpannen van de huisjes is er niets historisch aan het verhaal moet vanuit de huidige wereld verteld worden om de mensen te inspireren met hedendaags theater in plaats van nagemaakte historische taferelen
2532243 sure were all hypocrites sometimes but some are bigger than others nobody listens to me but public figures can have a lot of influence on other people and theres nothing worse than them telling others not to do things that they themselves do
2532244 dont trust noam chomsky he hasnt given up all his positions to go live on an anarchosyndicalist commune
2532245 the republicans are telling us not to use 527s to smear them but what about the swiftboat vets etc if they can do it we certainly can too
2532246 we are going to have some disappointment with retailers and consumers
2532247 i felt like a race horse in a world without racetracks or a champion college footballer suddenly confronted by wall street and a business suit his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with a date engraved on it
2532248 i thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow the million moving shapes and cul de sacs of shadow there was shadow in bureau drawers and closets and suitcases and shadow under houses and trees and stones and shadow at the back of peoples eyes and smiles and shadow miles and miles and miles of it on the night side of the earth
2532249 what you say is all well and good but the fact of the matter is that its against the law and is therefore wrong
2532250 but there is some justification to the law if i write a poem or make a sculpture or compose a song assuming i already legitimately possessed the tools and materials used shouldnt i own that thing that ive made
2532251 but what if say i put a lot of hard work into making that item while this other person skips all that and just takes the finished product for his own use isnt this unfair
2532252 precisely the same thing applies to issues of prestige or fame it would be wrong to profit from someone elses efforts like that isnt this a sufficient justification for intellectual property
2532253 how can we ensure that people can be artists and still be able to make a living
2532254 you have thoroughly convinced me i was foolish not to see the larger picture you truly are a great thinker and wise person and probably also an excellent dancer
2532255 it is utterly obvious that in any major work that the human hand undertakes the strength of individuals cannot be increased nor the forces of all united without the aid of tools and machines

2532262 folks today is a historic backpacking date that is being celebrated in other parts of the country exactly 60 years ago today something significant happened up here at this summit anyone up here know the significance of this date august 5 1948
2532263 eleven years after his excursion to katahdin and after he missed his last opportunity to return he revealed to a close friend that the experience was still very much apart of him i keep a mountain anchored eastward a little way which i ascend in my dreams both awake and asleep

2532270 we havent seen indications or any concrete evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and ive been saying that consistently for the last five years
2532271 verification and enforcement of the non proliferation objectives contained in the npt are limited in part to maintain the balance of rights and obligations of states parties npt safeguards administered by the international atomic energy agency iaea are limited to verifying that no nuclear material in each non weapon state has been diverted to weapons or unknown use these safeguards allow for the iaea to report a case of non compliance to the security council only if nuclear material is found to have been diverted
2532272 under a traditional view the authority of the security council is limited to cases which have been found to constitute a threat to international peace and security
2532273 threat to peace breach of peace or act of aggression
2532274 it calls into question the legitimacy of the security council in intruding on matters of enforcing treaty law on matters that do not rise to the level of threat to the peace
2532275 israel will attack iran if it doesnt abandon its nuclear program
2532276 if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
2532277 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran
2532278 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
2532279 war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole

2532308 our aim is to develop a network to promote scientific exchange between switzerland china
2532309 swissnex will also liaise with the chinese authorities with switzerland and with swiss industry in china
2532310 i am convinced that china will soon close the gap between it and the united states the frontrunner which invests around 330 billion annually in research and development
2532311 the top universities in china are already among the best in the world
2532312 already today around five per cent of our students come from china and research in china is becoming increasingly popular it is a sharply rising trend
2532313 for us it is important to have a partner on the ground with swissnex
2532314 we are pleased to provide our resources for research projects
2532315 student and families were probably passive in terms of how they went about obtaining a loan from a student lender
2532316 a lot of these mistakes come down to the functioning of payroll
2532317 to be honest it just seems like one of those great opportunities where the target is there and shame on us if we dont go after it
2532318 when it comes to business this city doesnt play games and neither do you but in just a couple of minutes cnbc is going to drop their business news programming
2532319 were saying hey theyre not going to be doing business coverage on this channel in just a few moments thats what you want to watch now right you dont want to watch those women with the ribbons on the batons whatever that sport might be do we really even think thats a sport
2532320 if they do then theres a second day story on it
2532321 there was something about being able to put 1 in the market in the morning and get 2 out in the afternoon that made people want to watch
2532322 it really was like televising a frat party its not as much pure fun now as when the markets going up but the information might be more important when its in the unsteady position its in
2532323 were trying to expand the audience of people who can watch financial news and not be frightened by it
2532324 our job is to create a smart audience not to create an audience that thinks were smart
2532325 we are very often judged by what we do versus cnbc so well buy some ads and try to drag some of their audience over
2532326 that if people will sample us if people will take the time to find us which is got to go to put in your zip code and it will tell you where to find going to like what they see
2532327 well what to do we have a ft flag bearer that does not really understand singapore national pride and patriotism

2532353 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2532354 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2532355 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2532356 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2532357 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2532358 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2532359 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2532360 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas

2532362 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

2532366 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2532367 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2532396 instead of helping americans who are struggling weve seen loopholes and lavish giveaways for corporations that ship jobs overseas and tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them
2532397 now senator mccain proposes to continue these costly and unfair bush tax policies
2532398 even if you dont have a cut bandages are a great way to make a statement that doesnt break the bank
2532399 it runs the gamut from just rudeness up to pretty extreme abusive behaviors
2532400 the severe cases of fatal violence get a lot of press but in some ways this is more insidious because it affects millions of people
2532401 rudeness impatience people being angry we used to do that kind of stuff at home but at work we were professional now its almost becoming trendy to do it at work
2532402 now people are losing their sense of embarrassment over it
2532403 people are coming to work after a long commute sitting in traffic watching their discretionary income burn up theyre ready for a fight or just really upset
2532404 that means people come into work after a weekend and they havent been able to let off any steam
2532405 many of us sense were losing ground economically and socially the safety net is unraveling hence anxiety and unease are skyrocketing
2532406 find comfort in believing their suffering is caused by a callous incompetent or selfish organization leader supplier union or regulatory body
2532407 the usual profile is type a really really smart with impossibly high standards they set for themselves as well as for other people
2532408 they are so invested i would say maybe over invested in success and in everyone being every bit as driven as they are that they just lose their sense of perspective and they can lash out at other people
2532409 devait expliquer aux fran ais pourquoi il na pas tenu parole
2532410 nicolas sarkozy na pas tenu parole il a menti dune certaine fa on puisquil avait dit quil ne se rendrait la c r monie douverture des jo que si les autorit s de p kin reprenaient le dialogue avec le dala lama et avec les tib tains
2532411 or ce dialogue na pas repris la r pression continue malgr tout il sest rendu p kin donc il doit sexpliquer et expliquer aux fran ais pourquoi il na pas tenu parole
2532412 on aurait pu attendre finalement de cette concession quen contrepartie il re oive le dala lama
2532413 moi ce que je souhaite cest quen contrepartie de sa pr sence p kin il ait le courage de rencontrer le dala lama

2532416 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2532417 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2532418 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2532419 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2532430 savings needed to fund health insurance and health care expenses in retirement
2532431 because the guidelines are intended to be general individuals who want to replace greater amount of the pr retirement income or have specific goals should consult with a planner who can create a customized strategy finally we hope that by the end of the summer morningstar ibbotson assoc will have developed an online calculator to on their and fpa web site
2532432 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2532433 these investors lives have been detrimentally affected because the money they thought was liquid is now tied up in this frozen market
2532434 based on investor complaints it appears to be a pervasive problem

2532442 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done

2532518 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2532519 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2532520 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2532521 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2532522 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2532523 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2532569 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2532570 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2532572 israel backs georgia in caspian oil pipeline battle with russia
2532573 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2532574 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2532575 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2532576 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2532577 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2532597 software is being imported from overseas markets and then being sold to american consumers who believe what theyre getting is fully licensed software
2532598 so the customers are essentially being deceived into purchasing software that doesnt provide them with all the rights that they think theyre paying for
2532599 these illegal dealers make these enormous profits because theyre only paying pennies on the dollar for software because theyre not buying it with licenses

2532603 facebook connects you to people you might have lost touch with but get their number or their screen name and talk to them in the world that lies outside of facebook
2532604 too much i dont really go on facebook that much i prefer gmail for chatting but i guess its smart for facebook to add that element since you can do everything else on facebook
2532605 no one here in france understood why it didnt have the chat function

2532611 adopted measures that among other things unfairly diluted ebays economic interest in craigslist by more than 10 percent
2532612 we are surprised and disappointed by ebays unfounded allegations which came to us out of the blue without any attempt to engage in a dialogue with us
2532613 ebay has absolutely no reason to feel threatened here unless of course theyre contemplating a hostile takeover of craigslist or the sale of ebays stake in craigslist to an unfriendly party
2532614 to be perfectly clear ebays stake in craigslist has not been unfairly diluted as they have claimed
2532615 its always interesting and frustrating to me when people who are not first responders tell those of us who are what public safety needs
2532616 commercial offerings do not offer the reliability provisions priority access and network pre emption capabilities customized customer care or command and control elements that public safety communications require while the fccs approach does

2532627 has over 500 000 html errors and does not meet section 508 accessibility requirements
2532628 as a policy matter allowing a state or anybody else to monopolize publication and distribution of statutes is a terrible idea it does nothing to incentivize the creation of new expressive works and prevents improvements in the accessibility of public domain materials

2532663 ive always harbored a distrust of politicians and ive met several and they didnt really convince me it wasnt until i met barack obama and i heard him speak that i thought there was a possibility for change that somebody could actually change the paradigm or even the psychology of politics that its not just other people that are making decisions not just corporations that are making decisions but that we all have to be included in that process

2532666 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2532667 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2532668 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
2532669 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2532670 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2532671 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2532672 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2532673 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2532674 come on we can have a better country we can change this around

2532684 one of the things that i noticed was that there was a real disconnect between the gay and lesbian community and the obama campaign
2532685 i would never presume to tell any community who to vote for
2532686 i can tell you who ill vote for all i can really do is give the information and you can make up your mind for yourself because god knows i dont think ive ever met a more self determined community
2532687 really ive always harbored a distrust of politicians and ive met several and they didnt really convince me and it wasnt until i met barack obama and i heard him speak that i thought there was a possibility for change that somebody could actually change the paradigm or even the psychology of politics
2532688 the pronoun that they use is we yes we can its not i and to make that a reality its incumbent upon all of us to do our best to bring our best selves to the table on behalf of everyone else not just ourselves
2532689 i think its an extension of playing the character for so long for me i do feel myself in some ways rooted in this community and i do feel like an honorary lesbian and with the amount of visibility that i have i have a unique opportunity to advocate for change or at least recognition
2532690 i was doing press for the show and they were going to show a clip from the l word that included a love scene of sorts between me and another character and she had the audacity to say if there are any children in the room you might want to ask them to leave and my mind was blown open and i said to her if it had been a heterosexual love scene would you have asked the same question i asked her on air because i thought its important to ask it contextualizes the import of the show my feelings were hurt and it just spoke to me of what the gay and lesbian community has to deal with on a day to day basis in terms of popular media and that was when it started and i think from playing this character for so many years and becoming more aware of different political issues i would just start to read the headlines more and more my mind was truly blown open when i found out that the lgbt community was not included in federal hate crimes law i just couldnt believe it it was so infuriating to me so whenever i have the opportunity i try to stand up and say something and if im not given the opportunity i sometimes will try to create the opportunity
2532691 we talked for three and a half hours and i learned so much and i learned so much from the users questions im really excited to be a part of the community and a part of the campaign even though its in a very small way i think its really just about getting information out and determining how you feel and realizing that its not only about you but its about the well being of the group at large so here i am
2532692 i dont think jennifer is trying to sway anyones vote though her efforts

2532699 i think there is a reasonably likely possibility that either one of us could end up with the popular vote and that regardless of where the pledged delegate count is it may not reflect what the overall popular vote of the election is thats something that i think will be considered
2532700 democrats should never ever be about disenfranchising voters and regardless of the rules and processes the fact is that 2 5 million people voted in these states
2532701 im a native floridian and it was the single largest turnout in primary history in the state of florida almost 1 8 million
2532702 what we have said all along is we want all the votes to be counted and there is a process in place and the process may end june 3rd it may end july 1st and rather than setting an arbitrary deadline i think it will become clear at some point in the campaign that its time for the apparent nominee to be in and for the other person to be out but i dont think were comfortable saying heres the date
2532703 well i think thats the most likely scenario but i dont know that thats going to be the case look theres a lot of focus on the campaigns going back and forth and what does this do to the nominee the greatest thing that could have ever happened to our party is a spirited contest in which 100s of thousands of new people are registering to vote as democrats hundreds of thousand of new people are coming out to vote those are all good things so i think its been a good thing just looking at it from a party perspective and i do believe when the nominee is selected and we are hoping and expecting it to be hillary that the partys going to come together
2532704 while were more than happy and thrilled to have congressmans franks support and hes been great in helping us we should not set an arbitrary deadline for when the nominee should or should not be determined
2532705 im very worried about the monks the soldiers regard them as something very different i cant understand why they do terrible things to monks

2532790 obstacles observations and opinions of an automotive internet sales manager
2532791 i will bring to the white house an unshakeable commitment to israels security
2532792 the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today unbreakable tomorrow and unbreakable for ever
2532793 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
2532794 i wrote decades ago that those who call themselves supporters of israel are in reality supporters of its moral degeneration and probable ultimate destruction
2532795 i have also believed for many years that israels very clear choice of expansion over security ever since it turned down egypts former president muhammad anwar sadats offer of a full peace treaty in 1971 may well lead to that consequence
2532796 yes i think that the aggressiveness is increasing and israel antagonizes not only the palestinian world but also the arab and islamic ones the military balance of power at present is in israels favor but this can change at any given moment especially once the us withdrew its support
2532797 at first people laughed saying it would not work now people are begging us to convert their cars
2532798 the lack of fuel the bad smell of cooking oil and the continued siege motivated us to enhance the work until we were successful and made the car operational

2532800 sayyed nasrallah is mandated by a large arab popular base and the popular forces support him despite the fact that some arab leaders and governments that are allied with the us differ on his role
2532801 its going to be us and al qaeda against hezbollah
2532802 when we hear al qaeda are threatening the shia we do celebratory gunfire
2532803 after the muftis speech we received funding from rich sunni individuals
2532804 what happened has pushed us into more co ordination we have more contact we are ready this is happening all over the country we have no problem with al qaeda coming in if they want to defend the sunnis
2532805 extremists are at the peak of their possible popularity and recruitment they could cause a security upheaval
2532806 the future movement lebanons mainstream sunni political party are all engineers and doctors
2532807 the feeling is that you need an extreme muslim group to face another extreme muslim group
2532808 the future movements weapon is education the sunnis cannot keep on holding pens in front of rifles
2532809 no one else has the amount of international support he has
2532810 the car bombs of iraq and brigades of martyrdom seekers
2532811 what happened at ein el helweh is just the beginning
2532812 we have been insulted by what hizbullah did in beirut but much more by what al hariri did not do
2532813 he has done nothing to defend ahl al sunna the sunnis
2532814 but this is over now because al hariri will not be killed again
2532815 you wanted to defend beirut instead you are almost creating al qaeda
2532816 we knew we were being used by al hariri as a bridge to reach parliament and we accepted this because the unity of the sect took precedence over all other interests but he did not show any appreciation for what we did and continued to exclude islamists from all positions of power be it the government or the parliament
2532817 but it is a significant support especially since the majority of its followers are young men
2532818 if al mustaqbal repeats this mistake of excluding islamists and salafists from its electoral list the salafists will have to reconsider their support for al hariri
2532819 the agreement will put an end to the political crisis in lebanon
2532820 we praise the arab committee for its effort and we stress the importance of the agreement syria supports everything that the lebanese agree on because security and stability in lebanon is vital and important to syrias security and stability
2532821 we are very happy that this accord has been reached
2532822 the islamic republic of iran hopes that the doha accord will provide a blossoming and brilliant future for the lebanese people and be the prelude to freeing the rest of lebanese territory
2532823 the agreement ends a complicated crisis which could have destroyed lebanons stability had it not been for the wisdom of certain lebanese politicians and the rapid arab intervention
2532824 that this agreement has been reached in doha is really a welcome development
2532825 it is a necessary and positive step toward accomplishing what the arab leagues initiative on lebanon was designed to do
2532826 a great success for lebanon and the lebanese who have never lacked courage and patience despite the trials they have been been through
2532827 france which has invested much effort in the search for a solution to the lebanese crisis never stopped backing the process that led to this agreement
2532828 personally very happy about this outcome for which i have worked continuously
2532829 we hope to see quickly the election of army chief michel suleiman to the post of president and the putting in place of a new government
2532830 the goverment of spain sends its warmest congratulations to the lebanese political forces for the agreement reached in doha to elect the consensus candidate general michel sleiman as president
2532831 spain which along with france and italy contributed to the mediation efforts trusts that the lebanese people will be able to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by this important agreement and by the peace prospects that are opening up in the middle east
2532832 that even the two hostages who were with me were killed in the crossfire
2532833 the agreement we reached is an exceptional agreement amid exceptional circumstances
2532834 we were always ready to give concessions for the sake of co existence and open a new page for reconciliation
2532835 lebanon sometimes falls down but it always gets back up again

2532840 tehran in many ways is as bleak and lifeless as a dead planet but it is surprising how little four months of strikes and almost complete economic denial have affected the majority of the population
2532841 that is essentially why any remaining opposition miscalculates not only the momentum of the movement but its deep and broad based commitment to making profound social changes that will make any return to the past impossible
2532842 even a jew when he brought suit against the highest official in the land could make his case and win
2532843 even the minorities will be protected and will have the power to bring the most powerful person in the country to justice
2532844 khomeini is a man who has been sitting in paris the land of freedom under an apple tree we are sitting here under the barrels of guns and tanks
2532845 a phone call from neauphle le ch teau to qum was better than any type of computer communication system
2532846 intelligence and policy failings were intertwined intelligence collection and analysis were weak and policymakers confidence in the shah in turn skewed intelligence
2532847 we are not trying to push bakhtiar on the people of iran if they decide to select a new leader of their government we are perfectly willing to cooperate with that choice
2532848 this decision does not surprise us i personally consider it a normal decision by a country that contributed in the establishment of the zionist entity a country that played a major role in uprooting the palestinians from their lands a country that made the belford promise a country that honored the author who made the ugliest accusations ever to prophet mohammed who are the fighters of the islamic resistance compared with our prophet the decision is a normal one and i believe it might have come too late
2532849 the timing is sketchy especially when the west as well as the arab world in interested in the swap deal
2532850 and this is why britain is seeking to present a different image
2532851 the coming decades will witness all attempts to falsely charge the resistance vanish in the wind
2532852 this does not mean that the german government did not exert any effort on the contrary it interfered whenever things got complicated
2532853 our condition was to keep the negotiations secret for their safety therefore we distanced ourselves from the media and we were not the source any leak
2532854 on the july 12 2006 i did not set a ceiling as for samir kintar the operation that was conducted back then was for the sake of his release there was no need for us to set a high ceiling through the media we are convinced that if we want to do this we do it in the process of the negotiations
2532855 hard and long negotiations had started they used to stop sometimes but they were never deemed over our negotiating team is highly competent and very much experienced months before the accomplishment of the deal we were negotiating on principals and then we moved on to details in principle the deal should include all lebanese detainees including kintar all the remains of lebanese palestinians and arabs the file of all individuals who went missing even before 1982 and releasing palestinian and arab detainees as well as the four iranian diplomats whom the lebanese forces handed over to israel
2532856 ron arad the two soldiers the body parts of more than 10 soldiers and the exclusion of kintar
2532857 but negotiations continued and we adhered to our principle in the following months breakthroughs were made as a result we made an exchange of the body of a drowned israeli sailor with a detainee and the bodies of two martyrs the issue of samir kintar had not been complete but he was introduced to the deal a short time ago and later on the deal comprised all detainees
2532858 we demanded his body be exhumed as well as the bodies of all the martyr who took part in the dalal moghrabi operation to be returned to their families
2532859 we agreed with hamas not to tie our negotiations with israel to theirs because this will complicate things but we insisted on the palestinian issue because of its symbolic indications so we accepted this agreement and we think it is important today i officially announce that we accept the agreement palestinian detainees especially women and children will be released the un chief will issue something in this regard and so will olmert
2532860 the only thing left is the timing that should be specified soon but if we set a date israel will counter that nevertheless i expect it will happen in a week or two there are israeli legal and judicial issues on samir kantars release
2532861 first i congratulate all lebanese on this achievement and i hope that all the lebanese consider it their achievement we will deal with it just as we dealt with the 2000 victory and we will not use this new achievement for internal ends this is our principle and these are our values i hope the lebanese appreciate this achievement that if it is completed lebanon will be the first arab country in the israeli arab struggle to close the detainee file after liberating the land excluding the shebaa farms and the kafar shouba hills
2532862 the second point is the bodies that will return to lebanon our national and ethical responsibility is to maintain what these martyrs sacrificed and died for and their funerals should be a national unified event a chance for the lebanese to meet again i personally announce hezbollahs absolute openness to any political meeting under any title and in any context if it helps in uniting lebanon preserving civil peace and overcoming the previous phase in lebanon
2532863 the final point is that i urge all popular powers to distance themselves from any provocation so that we can make good and civilized use of the sacred blood in bridging the gaps between the lebanese also allow me to speak firmly of celebratory gunfire this is a very dangerous matter people are falling victims by this kind of firing we can no longer tolerate this anyone who fires a gun to celebrate is firing that gun at me at my head at my heart and at my turban
2532864 we are always ready to discuss the defense strategy we are not afraid of discussion anyone afraid of discussion is weak and has done something wrong we have a comprehensive defense strategy and we are ready to discuss it at all times
2532865 as john kennedy declared in germany i am a berliner i say now i am a jew
2532866 the state of israel in its current form is history
2532867 we call child murderers child murderers and will never accept that they have a divine or historic mandate excusing their outrages
2532868 shame on ethnic cleansing shame on every terrorist strike against civilians be it carried out by hamas hezbollah or the state of israel
2532869 we dont believe in the notion of gods chosen people we laugh at this nations fancies and weep over its misdeeds
2532870 it is the state of israel that fails to recognize respect or defer to the internationally lawful israeli state of 1948 israel wants more more water and more villages to obtain this there are those who want with gods assistance a final solution to the palestinian problem
2532871 were dealing with an ignorant man a hate filled man who derides judaism
2532872 this is a classic anti semitic manifesto which cannot even disguise itself as criticism of israel
2532873 the writer does not address the conflict in its contemporary context but reaches back thousands of years to assert that the jewish people have traits of cruelty that have remained unchanged and account for the current war
2532874 ive been head of the institute for the study of contemporary anti semitism for 15 years and its not every day that i get to read such a radical document in terms of its content and rhetoric
2532875 we do not believe that israel mourns 40 killed lebanese children more than it has lamented for more than 3 000 years 40 years in the desert we note that many israelis celebrate such triumphs like they once cheered the scourges of the lord as fitting punishment for the people of egypt
2532876 but an open debate on the issue is better than a covert one
2532877 gaarders voice is important in the norwegian discourse and it was right to publish the article
2532878 as far as we know the soldiers regev and goldwasser are not alive
2532879 but none of this matters because it is not fact they were alive when they were kidnapped and no one has provided us with evidence to the contrary
2532880 if they wont bring the soldiers back i believe the message is to the people here is that the country is not going to stand for them and this is why people in this country are not going to stand for this country
2532881 i believe in this deal with all my heart theres no room for hesitation not to agree to the deal is to erase our obligation to bring back every soldier
2532882 the principle must be releasing live prisoners for live hostages and releasing bodies in return for the fallen
2532883 we are now handing over the two imprisoned israeli soldiers who were captured by the islamic resistance on july 12 2006 to the international committee of the red cross
2532884 the israeli side will now hand over the great arab mujahid holy warrior samir qantar and his companions to the icrc
2532885 it increases the motivation to protect this country and it shows us who we are dealing with
2532886 liberation of the captives a new dawn for lebanon and palestine
2532887 oh get out of my way so i can speed up
2532888 how to get my ex girlfriend back she has not answered any of my call she did not even bother to reply my text messages have i done something wrong
2532889 senator mccain talks about putting our country first but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back we cant afford to take that chance
2532890 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall

2532901 stop swimming against the tide of in rainbows on torrents a study he co wrote with will page chief economist with the mcps prs alliance
2532902 all the media hysteria surrounded the speculation of the average price paid for in rainbows yet this could be viewed as missing some of the wider objectives of the project
2532903 one example can be analysed here namely that inrainbows com set out to redirect the inevitable torrent traffic that would have taken place with any high profile album release back towards the bands official website
2532904 from a management perspective this could be paraphrased as if youre not going to pay for the record then at least give us your email addresses as this provides a currency of its own when planning tours and other promotional activities
2532905 this gives rise to the complex counterfactual question of could legal free displace illegal free which this paper will now attempt to answer namely did the project succeed in diverting traffic away from venues where the band receives nothing and towards a venue where it could receive something be it the currency of cash or at least an email address
2532906 how do we get out of this mess were in what do we do first what then
2532907 president obama we would like to get to work on passing three major pieces of legislation of your choice and have them on your desk to sign into law by your 100th day in office just tell us which ones you feel are most important to get done
2532908 60 1 seats in the senate and a majority in the house
2532909 an ocean going vessel with mail for partisans on it
2532910 barack obama was named the most liberal member of the senate
2532911 ive made my mind up dont bother me with the facts
2532912 the old ways of attacking me wont work because i am something new and different
2532913 that is why i support senator obama he is not going to be a democrat president
2532914 its not about working with democrats its about defeating them
2532915 and it is the disingenousness demonstrated by senator obama on iraq in particular the october 2002 resolution authorizing the use of us military force in iraq that has prevented me from enthusiastic support for his candidacy
2532916 adding minor presidential candidates including independent ralph nader and libertarian bob barr to the equation both minor candidates garner three percent support and obamas lead over mccain jumps to 10 points 46 to 36
2532917 but the inescapable conclusion is however you add it up barr and nader on the ticket is drawing more support from mccain than obama and widening the gap between them
2532918 if the election were today who would you vote for
2532919 if the election was today and you could only vote for obama or mccain who would you pick
2532920 overheated rhetoric and personal attacks on our opponents distract from the big differences
2532921 throughout his life john mccain has held himself to the highest standards and he will continue to run a respectful campaign based on the issues
2532922 you see i took a trip overseas recently and visited some wounded soldiers in iraq
2532923 youre paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
2532924 short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief
2532925 now although it wont save you dollars at the pump i have to say that it has helped raise campaign dollars
2532926 because last month senator mccain raised more than a million dollars from guess who oil and gas company executives and employees most of whom most of these campaign contributions came after he went to houston to meet with a bunch of oil executives and announce that he was in favor of offshore drilling thats not a strategy designed to end our energy crisis its a strategy designed to get politicians through an election

2532932 but hes the commander in chief he can do whatever he wants with the military
2532933 the approach is clever but it has evoked limited enthusiasm as of this writing the proposal has been around nearly a year but only one state legislature california has approved it even there the measure was opposed by 42 of 43 republican lawmakers and it was vetoed subsequently by governor arnold schwarzenegger

2532936 i dont think that any bank that goes to the extent that ubs has gone through to avoid doing what their agreements with the united states require them to do should be allowed to continue to do business unless they clean up their act
2532937 the imperial presidency of george w bush and possible legal responses
2532938 i welcome todays announcement that the president has reversed course and dropped his adamant opposition to a timeline for redeployment of american troops from iraq
2532939 the president should begin a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from iraq so that we can meet the many other challenges we face around the world starting with taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan the people who actually attacked us on 9 11
2532940 the minute the story got out about america at long last trying some diplomacy towards iran oil prices fell ten percent theres a good reason for this a lot of the price per barrel america has been paying for oil is the risk involved in bushs saber rattling towards iran when that danger premium on the price is seen to recede then the price itself recedes i guess president bush is finally coming around to barack obamas way of thinking too bad it took this long and were paying so much now at the pump for bushs intransigence
2532941 its interesting to me that senator john mccain is proposing a gas tax holiday which he originally wanted to take effect at the beginning of the summer the reason its interesting is that since then john mccain hasnt managed to make it to a single senate vote leadership requires your presence senator mccain if a gas tax holiday was so important to you why didnt you return to the senate and make it a reality or is this just a cheap campaign gimmick meant to fool voters
2532942 i dont want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf i feel i owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as i can with them and i think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal
2532943 president bush said a few months ago and i quote playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signals i guess that standard doesnt apply to wealthy fundraising events for john mccain where you can pay five thousand dollars to have your foursome greeted by president bush i guess he should have told the troops playing golf during a war sends the wrong signals unless youre a wealthy republican donor as it would have been more accurate
2532944 im astonished that john mccain has kept phil gramm as his key economic advisor after his comments about america being a nation of whiners and that the recession is all in our heads we learned last week that the swiss bank which employed mr gramm as vice chairman is probably guilty of wholesale defrauding of the irs of tax moneys by helping the wealthiest of the wealthy in america hide their assets in swiss banks is this really the man john mccain wants giving him advice on the american economy more to the point is this really who american voters want giving economic advice to our next president
2532945 the energy information administration reported that u s crude oil supplies rose by 3 million barrels or 1 percent last week that is the opposite of the 3 million barrel draw analysts surveyed by energy research firm platts expected gasoline supplies also leapt unexpectedly
2532946 a number of market participants speculated that at least some of the weeks sell off was the result of cash strapped banks selling energy contracts to raise money for other needs

2532949 do not question the ways of huffpost for the moderators are snarky and quick to whine to arianna
2532950 obamas trip is news we cover news end of comment
2532951 john mccain has been painted by the media as some sort of foreign policy giant a man who is in tune with everything thats happening in the world this myth is never challenged by the press at all but somebody on mccains campaign should really buy him a world atlas which was published after 1993 because he keeps getting basic world geography wrong some foreign policy expert i think most americans would prefer a man in the white house who can remember the names of the countries of the world without having to correct himself three times in the same week
2532952 john mccain quibbles about tactics in iraq but barack obama is concentrating on the overall strategy for america in the region which makes sense george bush and john mccain have finally come around to obamas sensible way of thinking on afghanistan which is a good sign but on iraq barack obama has staked out a position that is wildly popular with the iraqi government the iraqi people and the american people obama is looking forward to the future in iraq while john mccain seems woefully stuck in the past setting a timetable for withdrawal is just common sense even george bush is starting to come around on this one why is john mccain still stubbornly ignoring the wishes of the iraqi people and the iraqi government
2532953 the millions of americans working at minimum wage jobs will find their paycheck a little bit bigger this week this is because democrats in congress managed over the strong opposition of republicans to get a law passed which mandated this raise so to those millions of people id like to say if you liked your recent raise in pay thank a democrat
2532954 was there anything that you saw on this trip that changed your mind
2532955 well i thought john also suggested that im always changing my mind so hes got to make up his mind about what he says about my mind
2532956 i love the smell of desperation in the morning smells like victory
2532957 i notice that the republicans in congress have been breaking with president bush and their own party on several democratic bills recently democrats have been trying to pass laws to fix any number of problems in this country and up until now republicans have mostly held firm in resisting commonsense change now that they see their jobs in jeopardy republicans have decided to support some of these democratic ideas astoundingly enough many republican senators will not even attend their own national convention this year out of fear of being seen with republicans i guess the american voting public has a choice this november they can go with democrats who want to get things done or they can vote for these democrat lite republicans why go with an imitation if you can have the real thing
2532958 john mccain said recently that obama would quote rather win an election than win a war unquote this from the man who swore he was going to have a dignified campaign without personal attacks i guess that promise was just politics huh john i defy john mccain to come up with a single quote where barack obama says he would like to lose in iraq he cant do it because it doesnt exist its not barack obama who is sinking into the gutter and the mud in this campaign john mccain is actually the one who quite obviously will say anything to get elected and the voters are smart enough to realize this
2532959 the right to swing your arms ends where someone elses nose begins
2532960 there is an essential deference between a miss statement and an intentional miss statement allegations or assertions of criminal misconduct or misconduct are easily made and the distance between an assertion and proof and conviction or this case impeachment is a long road
2532961 you should all remind yourselves that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were caligula
2532962 it is the proper role of the judiciary committee given that we congress received a resolution that made representations that all turned out that most turned out to be categorically false it would then seem to me that it would be appropriate to commit an inquiry so you can get at the truth then if the truth backs up that the administration made misrepresentations then it would be up to the committee to decide to forward that in a form of a report to the full house and weather the house then as individual members would act up it the only reason im here and the only reason i have been pushing for a moment like this were in a six hour hearing now is for members of the judiciary could have things laid out in front of them and get to the truth lets find out what the truth is was congress presented with a case for war that was not based on the truth and if that happened there has to be consequences
2532963 oh wow if all these people i trust to represent me are saying that these things are necessary maybe just maybe they are right and i am wrong
2532964 no country has ever been saved by good men because good men will not go to the lengths that may be necessary
2532965 oh wow if all these people i trust to represent me are saying that these things are necessary maybe just maybe they are right and i am wrong
2532966 even nixon didnt go on national tv to admit an impeachable offense
2532967 gang of 8 was briefed not even the full intelligence committees or armed services committees were briefed so while you have a point its a limited one and being briefed is not exactly the same as authorizing although they could have made a stink about it and didnt so point taken
2532968 it doesnt take a lot of talent to intercept a surface to air missile with your own airplane
2532969 now to the presidential campaign where suddenly john mccains war record is an issue in the campaign not that there are any questions about his war record mind you annapolis graduate naval aviator shot down over hanoi during the vietnam war captured tortured held as a pow for five years
2532970 not that there are any questions about his war record mind you
2532971 were going to do everything exactly the opposite of how clinton did things
2532972 the americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of iraq
2532973 when is the u s leaving when will we be truly sovereign
2532974 if the iraqis ask us to leave then we of course will leave
2532975 theyre dragging in a lot of analysts and ramping up everything
2532976 the guys now running the iranian program have limited direct experience with iran in the event of an attack how will the iranians react they will react and the administration has not thought it all the way through
2532977 by intensifying the conflict in iraq and also in afghanistan their neighbors and that could draw in pakistan we will be stuck in a regional war for twenty years
2532978 we know that the iranians are strengthening their air defense capabilities
2532979 and we believe they will react asymmetrically hitting targets in europe and in latin america
2532980 a major air strike against iran could well lead to a rallying around the flag there but a very careful targeting of terrorist training camps might not
2532981 once the iranians get a bloody nose they rethink things
2532982 might go to the supreme leader and say the hard line policies have got us into this mess
2532983 do you think those crazies in tehran are going to say uncle sam is here
2532984 the reality is an attack will make things ten times warmer
2532985 were going to leave iraq as fast as events on the ground make it possible while still leaving some troops behind
2532986 are all telling us the same thing they need something like this in there iraqis want to know that foreign troops are not going to be here forever
2532987 we can now talk about timetables for withdrawal in iraq because we have achieved a stunning victory and it is now safe and prudent to do so

2532989 in exactly two hours id do more for the flag than anyone since betsy ross as our star spangled retinue approached the hallowed halls of congress a detachment of police summoned to the scene quickly encircled us you are under arrest for the desecration of the flag come with us instantly the steps became a swarm of cameramen cops and screaming yippies i fought for life and shirt swinging wildly rrrrrrrrrip you pigs you ripped my fuckin shirt i screamed the next day i stood before the judge bare to the waist the tattered shirt lay on the prosecutors table in a box marked exhibit a you owe me fourteen ninety five for that shirt i mentioned bail was set at three thousand dollars get out of here with that viet cong flag how dare you the judge intoned cuban your honor i corrected hoffman had painted a cuban flag on his body a few months later this same judge started letting his hair grow long called for the legalization of marijuana and began speaking out against the war
2532990 your honor i regret that i have but one shirt to give for my country
2532991 by the time we had won the appeal over three dozen people had already been arrested for similar offenses a vest in virginia a bedspread in iowa all with the familiar flag motif in arguing for the government in defense of the law nixons prosecutor stated the importance of a flag in developing a sense of loyalty to a national entity has been the subject of numerous essays the first essay the u s government quoted was a lengthy passage from mein kampf by historys most famous housepainter adolf hitler
2532992 i told him how i had just been given a thirty day jail sentence not for wearing the star spangled shirt but for the thoughts in my head how ricky nelson roy rogers dale evans raquel welch and phyllis diller had all worn similar flag garb on television and in movies how anyone could go to the fashionable boutique a few blocks from the studio where i had bought the shirt and get one just like it
2532993 an incident occurred during the taping of the following program that had presented cbs network officials with a dilemma involving not only poor taste and the risk of offending the viewers but also certain very serious legal problems it seemed one of the guests had seen fit to come on the show wearing a shirt made from an american flag not true it was a shirt with a flag motif therefore to avoid possible litigation the network executives have decided to mask out
2532994 in all 88 000 people were angry enough that night to call and protest the censoring in the following days stores all over the country sold out their stock of shirts bearing the flag motif demonstrations were held at cbs offices in three cities and merv griffin publicly apologized saying he had not been told of the censoring in advance
2532995 thank you mr chairman and i too join in thanking you for calling these hearings mr chairman i am very pleased that were looking at this because ive probably had a little longer experience with this whole flag issue than some of the others after my exploratory race for the presidency in 1987 one of the womens magazines decided that they wanted to do a documentary about that and we thought about what kind of cover would dramatize my feeling about the process and about america and we decided to do one of myself wrapped in the flag in the sylvester stallone rocky ii type of thing and in the american hockey team type of thing showing the expansiveness of the american system and how exciting it was we thought it was a very positive upbeat love of america type of thing well i can tell you a lot of people didnt laughter i got lambasted by all sorts of people for that and as that little mini debate raged in america people started sending me all sorts of clips mr chairman i wont bring all the clips but both the pros and cons would send me clips talking about what do we mean when we talk about flag desecration and what are we talking about in this whole area of how do we use the flag or who can use the flag because of all of these clips which anybodys welcome to look at i probably have the worlds biggest file on the american flag in washington and on public officials crying in public but i wont bring them all out but let me just show you some of the things that are interesting we have here barbara bush at the foot of the lincoln memorial with a flag around her neck during the inaugural we have someone who made a cashmere flag into a dress for 2500 and we have abbie hoffman wearing a flag now you know thats a range of things and its interesting are some of those desecrations is the commercial use good or bad those are very difficult issues then we have the whole thing of what do you do with artistic renditions here we have the washington times not exactly a leftist newspaper putting the president in a flag is that proper im not sure if you look at the american legion calendar for 1988 they were the first to criticize my use of the flag i was on the february cover of 1988 let me show you the january cover of the american legion magazines calendar and im not quite sure what the difference is in all of this its a little puzzling but maybe thats okay and im not again i am have difficulty in knowing where all these lines are and finally here we have an interesting thing where the top picture is one of the recent press photos that many people protested women using the flag at one of their meetings however the bottom picture is the ladys auxiliary of the vfw marching and i really wonder how we know which of these is desecration and which isnt theyre both womens groups theyre all american citizens and theyre all talking about the flag so i guess what im saying is i find this a very complex issue do we allow commercial uses of the flag over used car dealers in magazines and advertisements weve got all sorts of those that i could have brought on board and shown you what about political parties use of the flag should one political party be able to hide behind it or isnt the flag big enough for everybody as ive seen america its been a wonderful country big enough for more than one opinion and that flag is a symbol thats big enough to encompass it all so as we talk about desecration as we talk about intent my experience has been these are very difficult issues and i hope people tell us how we will know whos truly desecrating and whos not burning is a lot clearer what about all these other things and what does desecration really mean
2532996 i had just been given a thirty day jail sentence not for wearing the star spangled shirt but for the thoughts in my head
2532997 what would abbie hoffman have thought of the flag lapel pin debate
2532998 professor yoo is quoted as saying that under certain circumstances it would be proper and legal to torture a detainees child to get necessary information do you agree with that
2532999 i dont agree or disagree with it mr chairman i dont plan to address it youre seeking legal opinion and as we told you in exhibit 4 im not here to render legal advice to your committee you do have attorneys of your own to give you legal advice
2533000 so tell us senator have you stopped beating your wife
2533001 governor if kitty dukakis his wife were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer
2533002 if theres a fire in a clinic and you can save a live baby or 100 frozen embryos but not both which one would you save
2533003 if your daughter were a member of the u s army and were captured by an enemy and waterboarding and other interrogation techniques you are condoning the united states use were used against her against your own daughter would you call those techniques torture or would you defend them as being legal techniques
2533004 if we hold a terrorist and we think he knows about an imminent plot you advocate aggressive interrogation techniques against him since his comfort is less important than saving the lives of so many in an attack on america but if he has been trained to resist interrogation and doesnt talk would you also advocate using the same techniques on his innocent nine year old daughter in front of him in an effort to make him talk
2533005 post as much as you want we like your work
2533006 there is no evidence to support the contention that if we treat terrorist prisoners
2533007 a ll the other courts to have decided the issue have held that the president did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information
2533008 the 2006 election was the end of the goldwater reagan conservative era forever
2533009 health care is broken i have an idea for how to fix it
2533010 we cant change a single thing health care is doing just fine
2533011 disavowing black radicals to appear safe to white voters moment
2533012 john mccain this week labeled social security an absolute disgrace then john mccains top economic advisor someone you would expect to see on mccains cabinet if he gets elected and who now runs a swiss bank just called the american people whiners for seeing the reality of the republican economic policies on their pocketbooks the elitist attitude dripping from their words is just astounding people in america are hurting because of what george bush and the republicans have done to our economy people are not whining they are crying for help these cries obviously fall on the deaf ears of john mccain and the deaf ears of the man he trusts to give him economic advice after all phil gramm and john mccain dont have to worry about mortgages gas prices or student loans they are millionaires the gop should just change its name to the millionaire party it certainly would be a lot more honest
2533013 no wonder john mccain doesnt get it about the effects of the bush economic policies on average americans it was just reported that his wife spent three quarters of a million dollars in just one month on her credit cards this isnt exactly an average american family i keep wondering why the media doesnt ask very simple questions to show what an out of touch elitist john mccain really is questions like so how many houses do you and your wife own senator mccain the average voter would be astonished at the answers to easy questions like that if of course they were ever asked
2533014 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession we have sort of become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
2533015 i guess what he meant is that its a figment of your imagination these high gas prices america already has one dr phil we dont need another one when it comes to the economy its not just a figment of your imagination its not only in your head
2533016 both george bush and john mccain have previously said that if the iraqis were to ask us to leave then we would since they are a sovereign country now that the iraqis are apparently ready to do just that bush and mccain are scrambling for some way to explain this it seems that the iraqis themselves are closer in their thinking to barack obamas plan for iraq than to the well be there for 100 years thinking of john mccain i look forward to mccain refining his plan to accept this fact on the ground in the very near future as his plan moves closer to what obama has proposed
2533017 when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the pressures physical pressures on me i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates
2533018 john mccain says he is reluctant to talk about his time as a prisoner of war which is amusing because he brings it up every chance he gets just look at his campaign ads but he just took political exploitation of his pow experience to a new level in pittsburgh he told a pow story and substituted the pittsburgh steelers for what he used to say was the green bay packers now i would believe those who say he just had a senior moment on the campaign trail if he had said this in san diego or jacksonville or chicago but he was clearly trying to appeal to local voters with this charmingly false story how can we believe anything mccain says about his war experiences if hell lie about details in a cheap effort to get votes will mccain stop at nothing in his effort to say anything to get elected if he were here right now id have to ask him sir are you now or have you ever been a cheesehead
2533019 a ll the other courts to have decided the issue have held that the president did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information
2533020 its perfectly legal and constitutional for intelligence services to monitor foreign international communications
2533021 doing the wrong thing for the right reasons should be applauded
2533022 we go straight from the gut right sir thats where the truth lies right down here in the gut do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head you can look it up i know some of you are going to say i did look it up and thats not true thats cause you looked it up in a book
2533023 its perfectly legal and constitutional for intelligence services to monitor foreign international communications
2533024 doing the wrong thing for the right reasons should be applauded
2533025 lets talk about your camp colonel and dont play dumb youre not as good at it as i am
2533026 michale i want to tap my neighbors phone line to make sure he is not planning more attacks on us
2533027 michale this neighbor is going to attack again and kill every one of us in the neighborhood i need to kill him before he does but i wont do it unless you agree
2533028 doesnt matter if he did it or not he was a scumbag who probably did a bunch of other stuff that he didnt get busted for so it all comes together in the end
2533029 i wouldnt have drafted the legislation like this and it does not resolve all of the concerns that we have about president bushs abuse of executive power
2533030 is keeping iran from having a nuclear bomb worth paying ten to thirteen bucks for a gallon of gas for the foreseeable future
2533031 is keeping iran or hezbollah or hamas or al qaeda from having a nuclear bomb worth paying ten to thirteen bucks for a gallon of gas for the foreseeable future
2533032 iran will be so shocked and awed by our bombing strikes that they will be shaking in their boots and not retaliate
2533033 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
2533034 has not seen any diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices
2533035 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
2533036 has not seen any diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices
2533037 the agency has been able to continue to verify the non diversion of declared nuclear material in iran iran has provided the agency with access to declared nuclear material and has provided the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with declared nuclear material and activities
2533038 the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one
2533039 nobody can get the truth out of me because even i dont know what it is i keep myself in a constant state of utter confusion
2533040 top 10 wrap up before i urge you to check it out every monday morning as i know you wont be disappointed to coin an oxymoron its seriously funny stuff
2533041 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
2533042 im going to try real hard to have a separate vote on immunity probably we cant take that out of the bill but im going to try
2533043 we shall fight them on the beaches were probably going to lose though we shall defend our island until we give up that is we shall in all likelihood surrender eventually
2533044 flip furthermore flop did i say flop i meant to say flip flip flip flop flippety floppety floo
2533045 excuse me did i hear you correctly youre saying obamas the biggest flip flopper in the race the list of issues which john mccain has flipped and flopped on is now so big i cant remember all of them mccain flip flops on torture tax cuts the religious right roe v wade lobbyists gay marriage creationism iraq talking to enemies and just about any other subject you care to name as a matter of fact the media is trying to paint obama as flip flopping on public financing for his campaign and yet not a word is said about the fact that john mccain has taken at least three positions on it himself including possibly breaking the law when getting a loan for his campaign from a bank thats right mccain flip flopped on a loan application from a bank is that the kind of man americans want as president i think not if you stacked up the flip flops from senator obama it would be a few pairs of beachwear whereas if you stacked up senator mccains flip flops it would look like imelda marcos shoe closet
2533046 maybe its the governors approval rating and you are running from him like you are from the president
2533047 and i stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago
2533048 john mccain made a joke recently about spousal abuse he said and i quote i stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago unquote i think this joke is in extremely bad taste and i am astonished john mccain said something like this i think it sends exactly the wrong message to the women of america that beating your wife is a joke now john mccain is old enough that when he was a child maybe beating your wife was a joke but times have changed since then i guess mccain has not i think americans deserve an apology from john mccain for his insensitive and demeaning comment
2533049 senator mccain says over and over again that he supports the troops but when he could have done just that he skipped the vote a new gi bill was just passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the senate almost every senator of both parties voted for it senator mccain is on the record as being against providing our brave men and women in uniform enough money to go to college when they get home george bush even threatened to veto it but john mccain couldnt even be bothered to show up for the vote the most important vote this year for military families so i guess all that talk about supporting the troops is just talk huh john
2533050 if i was a constituent of senator john mccain i would be asking why he has skipped more votes than anyone else in the senate in the past two years arizonans sent mccain to washington to do a job and he is just not doing it if campaigning is taking all of john mccains energy and he is too tired to travel back to washington to perform his duties as a senator then maybe he should step down and let someone with more energy and dedication to the job represent arizona instead of mccains empty senate chair
2533051 any republican running for office has to run basically on an independent platform localize the race and not take anything for granted there are no safe republican seats in this election
2533052 i see that republicans across the country are being told
2533053 boy it must be tough to be a republican these days when ronald reagan left office people renamed dozens if not
2533054 obama says hell vote for fisa were we fooled again hillary lite did we let a real president dodd slip through our fingers
2533055 how the media got it wrong so far on campaign 2008
2533056 the first thing we need to do is tackle campaign finance reform and get public financing of federal elections
2533057 minnesotans need a senator whos got their back norm coleman hasnt even been on their side
2533058 page up where they itemize some of the jokers theyre running against
2533059 gang of 14 of republican congressmen are publicly stating they wont back john mccain in the election on a political earthquake scale of 1 to 10 this is about a 28 heres the list courtesy of
2533060 scramble the political deck break up old alliances and bring odd bedfellows together in a new coalition
2533061 dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of weekend at bernies handcuffed to a corpse
2533062 will pollute the political environment to toxic levels and create an epidemic that could damage the country for generations to come
2533063 you cant do dis dat and de other thing under the current laws
2533064 we should argue that we are fighting for rights and freedoms
2533065 why on earth would you want to fight for the rights and freedoms of terrorists
2533066 the simple fact is terrorism these days is not a law enforcement judicial issue its a military issue and should be handled as such
2533067 why on earth would you want to fight for the rights and freedoms of terrorists
2533068 it is better one hundred guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should suffer
2533069 it is better one hundred guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should suffer
2533070 24 i invite you to recall 3 words united flight 93
2533071 i suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post
2533072 these are your only two choices any other choice will result in the detonation of the nuclear device
2533073 do you have the fortitude the guts to make the tough call
2533074 well i need more than chocolate and for that matter i need more than vanilla i believe that we need freedom and choice when it comes to our ice cream and that joey naylor that is the defintion of liberty
2533075 flight 93 was reality your nuclear holocaust scenario is a completely false hypothetical this was my point
2533076 and please michale is it possible you could write a response without trying to make me responsible for killing millions of people
2533077 what were trying to argue is that there are better more effective ways that dont compromise our rights
2533078 well i need more than chocolate and for that matter i need more than vanilla i believe that we need freedom and choice when it comes to our ice cream and that joey naylor that is the defintion of liberty
2533079 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2533080 take all this back if maybe theres a chance to prevent something but we arent quite sure and have no evidence but we grant you the power to hold anyone for any reason at any time youd like so long as you say the word terror three times fast
2533081 failure to make a decision is a decision in itself and it is invariably the wrong decision
2533082 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2533083 what about sticking with your beliefs even if it costs a hundred lives or a thousand lives or more
2533084 of course not no one can guarantee anything with regards to fighting terrorism
2533085 yes dammit the principles of the us constitution are paramount even if it means the death of hundreds thousands or even millions of innocent people
2533086 your theory pre supposes that if we treat terrorists with love and respect they will reciprocate there is absolutely nothing to support such a wild assertion you can ask daniel pearl or nicholas berg if you dont believe me oh wait you cant they were brutally murdered by the group of people you want to show compassion for
2533087 surely if you believe in them so strongly it would be easy to say yes dammit
2533088 chuck norris does not believe in the periodic table because he only recognizes the element of surprise
2533089 when the bogeyman goes to bed at night he checks under his bed and in his closet for chuck norris
2533090 its a very simple yes or no question and theres no real fiscal impact just the cost of relettering the sign in front of the plant
2533091 this is the way the democratic process is supposed to work even though its a silly idea in some peoples eyes
2533092 theres no use other than to make these nutcases feel good
2533093 bush has always done well for the affluent of america and anyone that does well for the affluent should be named for the effluent
2533094 as george w bush left office with the lowest approval ratings of any president in the history of taking such measurements the citizens of the city of san francisco chose to honor him by renaming a waste treatment plant on the day he left office
2533095 when one ridicules and debases ones opponent they ridicule and debase their own argument
2533096 if you put it in the oven honey then you baked it
2533097 the solution my friends isnt a one size fits all big government takeover of health care it resides where every important social advance has always resided with the american people themselves with well informed american families making practical decisions to address their imperatives for better health and more secure prosperity
2533098 since you have denounced big government health care and your new plan would get rid of employer based health care when will you be personally refusing all v a health care benefits and your senate health insurance and instead doing what you want every american to do buying your health insurance on the open market tomorrow next week maybe
2533099 is a 60 seat democratic majority possible in the senate
2533100 south carolina lindsey graham too liberal wow well i guess hes against torture but id hardly call him a liberal
2533101 the points that were put forth by the americans were more abominable than the occupation
2533102 but now we are being asked to sign for our own occupation that is why we have absolutely refused all that we have seen so far
2533103 is there sovereignty for iraq or isnt there if it is left to them they would ask for immunity even for the american dogs
2533104 we have given bush our views some new ideas and i find that there is a certain harmony between his thoughts and ours and he promised to tell the negotiators to change their methods
2533105 he said to may toe instead of to maa toe
2533106 theyve been fighting for two thousand years theyre bound to get tired soon
2533107 if the romulans are off shoots of my vulcan blood and i think this likely then weakness is something we dare not show
2533108 you dont fight a junkyard dog with aspca rules what you do is you take the leash off your bigger meaner dog
2533109 when were at war the president cannot be questioned or restrained in any way shape or form
2533110 congress can never ask any question to any person who has ever shaken hands with the president
2533111 well tell you the conclusions we want reached then you can write your report to justify those conclusions
2533112 george bush did this exact thing when he was president therefore what i am doing is no different and at the time congress agreed with bush so if you dont agree with me then youre obviously playing politics with national security and putting our nation at risk
2533113 the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states
2533114 i dont particularly agree with it but to a certain extent i think it is probably inevitable this is about taxes not tracking information
2533115 too little data to be useful for most intelligence gathering efforts
2533116 heres an amazing fact if you take the 2004 results give mccain new hampshire which kerry won which i think is reasonable give obama new mexico colorado and iowa which bush won in all of which now obama is ahead you end up leave everything else the same which is quite possible you end up with 269 269 result that would be fun
2533117 shall be in addition to those appointed by the states but they shall be considered for the purposes of the election of president and vice president to be electors appointed by a state and they shall meet in the district and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment
2533118 i believe art affects a country indirectly i have been studying the decline of morals in this country its sending the wrong message to children that nudity is fine that nakedness is fine there are degrees of vulgarity and it opens up the door for the other stuff
2533119 other stuff what other stuff what the hell are you talking about hey everybody check this out this is funny look at what idiots some people are
2533120 in honor of george carlin examining nipplephobia and buttcrackphobia in america
2533121 the latest presidential poll from alaska from may 14 shows obama behind mccain by eight points 42 to 50 but this is already seven points higher than kerry managed in 2004 35 to bushs 62 which in itself was a democratic high water mark in alaska for the past four presidential election cycles
2533122 until theres either a big enough majority in the senate or a change in the presidents approach i dont see a significant improvement situation improvement sic in iraq
2533123 do you know general what is going on in the streets of najaf today moqtada al sadr has called for a million people to march today and news footage shows he may not have one million but that he does indeed have the support of a large number of iraqis would you care to comment sir
2533124 can you explain how what the new york times calls dozens of officers including at least two senior field commanders from the iraq army deserted their posts during the recent operation in basra is the iraq army ever going to be able to stand up so that american forces can stand down or is this a hopelessly optimistic goal that will never in fact be achieved
2533125 our troops in iraq are paying about 3 25 a gallon for gas in iraq comparable to what we pay here while the iraqis are paying 1 36 a gallon this is a raw deal for the american taxpayer
2533126 i guess the media had better things to do this week than investigate a bush cabinet member who resigned under several dark clouds and investigations just when the housing crisis in this country is reaching its worst we find that the man in charge of hud appears to be about as competent as bushs former fema director heckuva job alphonso
2533127 it amazes me that john yoo is still a professor of law at berkeley when he so obviously does not understand even the basics of the bedrock of all american law the constitution while i am relieved he does not currently hold a position in bushs white house i am concerned what he is teaching to berkeley students of law now berkeley should be publicly called upon to explain why it pays this man to educate future lawyers
2533128 a recent survey of 109 professional historians showed that 98 percent of them thought the bush presidency will be judged a failure by history who am i to argue with the professionals i just hope we can get through the next ten months without further disasters until we can put a democrat in the white house again
2533129 should the city and county of san francisco rename the oceanside wastewater treatment facility the george w bush sewage plant
2533130 i can think of no more fitting statement on the policies and legacy of george w bush than renaming a human waste processing facility after him my only concern is that it probably should be located either in midland texas or perhaps in washington d c
2533131 lincoln had the so called sewards folly which gave us the state of alaska bushs folly has instead given us a sewage plant in san francisco
2533132 veterans said to me in their speeches and in private that the american people did not know anything about the meuse argonne battle
2533133 when we joined we promised to visit the grave once a year and to lay flowers on the grave sometimes people take flowers from their own gardens and they say it is like a son like a cousin like a brother it is a member of the family
2533134 these words and the words that follow were not just written for the yangs but for the kohms as well
2533135 they must apply to everyone or they mean nothing do you understand
2533136 i do not fully understand one named kirk but the holy words will be obeyed i swear it
2533137 we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
2533138 will you be a lousy scab or will you be a man
2533139 what weve got is a deficiency in our message and a loss of confidence in the american people that we will do what we say were going to do
2533140 we havent hit bottom yet ive never seen members so frustrated or demoralized
2533141 these races were not in new jersey or new england where republican erosion has taken place over the last decade they were in the heart of the bible belt the social conservative core of our coalition members and pundits waiting for democrats to fumble the ball so that soft republicans and independents will snap back to the gop fail to understand the deep seeded sic antipathy toward the president the war gas prices the economy foreclosures and in some areas the underlying cultural differences that continue to brand our party
2533142 dr kings dream began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964 when he was able to get through congress something that president kennedy was hopeful to do presidents before had not even tried but it took a president to get it done that dream became a reality the power of that dream became real in peoples lives because we had a president who said were going to do it and actually got it accomplished
2533143 well why cant obama be a dreamer and actually have that political power himself as well
2533144 is this really the best way to win the democratic nomination by belittling one of the most beloved democratic presidents ever while at the same time pointing out the ineffectiveness of the patriarch of the civil rights movement isnt that kind of disrespectful to two icons of what the democratic party stands for
2533145 he should pick clinton for his vp if anything ever happened to him shed make a great president
2533146 clinton camp used what later seemed to become the campaigns modus operandi for such statements make a provocative statement immediately deny that it means what it seems to mean on the face of it attack the obama camp for pointing out that these words actually came from her mouth and then jump all over the media for drawing attention to such a non issue and demanding the benefit of the doubt for what she said
2533147 if you look back some people have been comparing one of the other candidates to jfk and he was a wonderful leader he gave us a lot of hope but he was assassinated and lyndon baines johnson actually did all his work and got the republicans to pass all those measures
2533148 hes a great guy but if you elect him hell get killed and ill have to do the work anyway so just elect me instead
2533149 the point at which you have no power left in washington because everyone is waiting for your successor
2533150 i think it is disgraceful that republicans talk a good line about supporting vets but when it comes down to paying for vets education on the day before the memorial day weekend 22 of them in the senate voted to stiff americas proud veterans democrats wrote this bill democrats pushed it through democrats voted for it its shameful that some republicans didnt i guess all that talk about supporting the troops is just that talk we need more democrats in the senate next year so that we can truly support the troops instead of ignoring them when they come home
2533151 the house and the senate just overrode the second bush veto on the farm bill we just passed as more and more republicans realistically weigh their chances for getting re elected this november we are likely to see this sort of thing happen more frequently than twice in seven years republicans in both the house and senate realized that their leadership is telling them to obstruct everything the democrats try to get done but that eventually they have to answer to their constituents back home at the ballot box of course if voters elect more democrats this fall we wont have to worry quite so much over the only thing the republican party has to offer america endless obstructionism if you want to see congress get some things done its time to vote these obstructionist republicans out of office
2533152 the pentagon just announced it has no idea what happened to
2533153 funny i didnt hear president bush denounce the state of israel for some neville chamberlain like appeasement after they announced they are going to begin talking to the syrian government since he has not done so it is obvious that his real intent in his remarks in the knesset were to bash barack obama inserting the upcoming american political season into a speech to a foreign government his silence on israels action speaks volumes i guess youre only an appeaser if youre a democrat running for an american office huh
2533154 george bush decries talking to iran as appeasement which is interesting just talking to an enemy isnt the definition of appeasement but giving in to them in negotiations and doing secret deals with our enemies to further their goals is appeasement now lets see is there an example from iran and americas recent past that fits that definition perhaps selling them weapons and spare parts after they took americans hostage i seem to recall that happening on a republicans watch bush might want to ask his daddy about what happened when he was ronald reagans vice president with regards to appeasing iran maybe george h w bush can help define the term for his son with particular attention paid to iran
2533155 john mccain has said over and over again that he fights lobbyists in washington and thinks lobbyists are a problem
2533156 friday talking points 33 if it quacks like a lame duck
2533157 a person is smart people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it
2533158 can you imagine the mess this country would be in if al gore had been the one to respond to 9 11 you cant see me but i am cringing at the thought
2533159 they want this because they are afraid that 16 will decide to go to college rather than re up where they got this figure i dont know but i would bet that it doesnt take into account the fact that recruiting would be an easier job with better benefits at the end of a first tour
2533160 hillary clinton graciously quits the race by this time next week
2533161 well she wants to exit on a strong point and so shell quit after she wins west virginia
2533162 attention all planets of the solar federation we have assumed control
2533163 a different reason why barack obama should not pick hillary clinton as vp
2533164 am i ever even going to wear this probably not
2533165 today we are standing for the majority of americans who are against the iraq war
2533166 were democrats republicans and independents and were sending a signal to our politicians that its time to get out of iraq now
2533167 big foreign corporations that control global shipping arent loyal or accountable to any country
2533168 but longshore workers are different were loyal to america and we wont stand by while our country our troops and our economy are destroyed by a war
2533169 the president still doesnt understand that americas limited resources cannot support this endless war that hes gotten us involved in
2533170 this is not a so called troop withdrawal pause with todays announcement the president signaled to the american people that he has no intention of bringing home any more troops
2533171 the president has a time line january 20th of next year our troops also need a time line
2533172 the president has taken us into a failed war hes taken us deeply into debt and that debt is taking us into recession
2533173 he is just dragging this out so he can put it at the doorstep of the new president of the united states
2533174 the best way to characterize moqtada al sadr is that he is the face and the leadership of a very important and legitimate political movement in iraq
2533175 it is a movement that has to be not just acknowledged but addressed dealt with reached out to by the government of iraq
2533176 and i think it is fair to say that that is the intention of the government
2533177 it is an important element in the iraqi landscape and certainly as a political movement no i would not consider it our enemy
2533178 well certainly anybody who shoots at our forces at iraqi forces or innocent civilians has to be dealt with
2533179 cloaking their actions in the name of what again is a respected movement a nationalist movement and one that is known for having reached out over the years to the poor and downtrodden in iraq that stayed in iraq during the saddam hussein period and suffered greatly at its hands
2533180 i believe marriage should be between a man and a woman and a woman and a woman
2533181 the quicker this page is turned by many americans including a lot of republicans the better
2533182 this administration is pretty tired right now and i think even the most die hard republicans are ready to move on
2533183 please john mccain oh please please pretty please make me your running mate
2533184 i do not believe that they iraqi elections will be in october probably november is the more accurate prediction but again theres every intention to have elections in the fall
2533185 we are winning in iraq we have achieved success after success and the only way to continue this success is to put republicans back in office if you vote for democrats you are voting for failure surrender and probably treason vote responsible republicans into office and we can get on with responsibly declaring victory and getting the troops out of iraq while leaving behind a shining beacon of democracy for the entire middle east to envy president bush was right all along john mccain is right as well and the only way we can continue this parade of victory is to elect john mccain our next president and give him a republican congress to get the nations business done safely responsibly and victoriously
2533186 at least a few media cycles before the american election
2533187 americans want to win in iraq they dont want to pull out if it means losing
2533188 well get the soldiers out gradually as victory is achieved
2533189 well get the soldiers out of iraq in a safe manner over a year and a half or so not precipitously i did not say the word precipitously or for that matter immediate withdrawal so dont say that i did
2533190 just get the troops out six months would be fine ok take a whole year to do it but just bring them home we could care less what happens afterwards
2533191 i think john mccain has exhibited the ongoing debate in his own campaign between john mccain and john mccain you dont know what he means on torture taxes tolerance of jerry falwell changed on drilling here you have a flip flop by john mccain flipping to the right and then flipping backward
2533192 its ok to torture others but not ok to invade on their rights the only thing more to say what hypocrites these people are
2533193 i posted a comment made on a blog as an argument
2533194 when faced with a no win scenario one has to choose the lesser of two evils
2533195 this is my campaign and i will make my own personnel choices
2533196 once you pay off my campaign debts then ill go campaign for you
2533197 his bump isnt as big as it should have been
2533198 the news media was sexist towards my campaign but theyre now being both sexist and racist at the same time towards michelle obama fox news recently called her obamas baby mama that is insulting and disrespectful on so many levels as well as proving that they dont even know the definition of the term baby mama and john mccain recently cancelled a fundraiser from a supporter who is a mainstream republican and ran for the governorship of texas while campaigning he compared the bad weather at a campaign event to rape his exact words were and i quote if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it he later said that he was just joking john mccain cancelled his appearance at this misogynists house but you know what mccain now says hes going to keep the money raised anyway that is who barack obama is running against if you dont think rape is a joke how can any woman or man for that matter vote for john mccain i call on all my supporters who have a little more respect for women than that to stand with me in supporting barack obama for president
2533199 work my heart out to make sure that senator obama is our next president
2533200 anyways in this atmosphere i dont see how obama can prevail in the general let alone any of the down stream races going dem
2533201 obama is worse much worse than mccain bush is probably better than obama
2533202 a comment in a blog or the actual polls that prove that the comment and commenter and thus michale is full of it
2533203 oh look these people actually like bowling isnt that quaint
2533204 gosh some of these people actually agree that theyre bitter about the economy
2533205 clinton was seen drinking an exotic concoction in these parts which weve learned is apparently called a boilermaker isnt that cute
2533206 if hillary wins how many points did she win by
2533207 you cant put a price on freedom unless youre rep chris carney that is
2533208 west virginians please note i refrained from making any sort of hillbilly jokes here although with senator clintons first name and her husbands as well the temptation to do so was almost overwhelming but i consider the term to be derogatory hence my restraint
2533209 theres always a lag between the end of an age and the realization that the age has ended
2533210 in early november after the earth has traveled four times around the sun the united states holds a presidential election the timing is entirely predictable but has little to do with political need
2533211 american voters carry a heavy burden they are asked to choose among more candidates for more offices more frequently than voters in any other country
2533212 the 14 8 million canadians who voted in their 2006 election cast just 14 8 million votes all for parliamentary candidates the 122 3 million americans who went to the polls in 2004 cast over 1 billion votes voting for president congress state executives state legislators county executives judges and miscellaneous offices on their ballots
2533213 i would call my attorney general in and review every single executive order issued by george bush and overturn those laws or executive decisions that i feel violate the constitution
2533214 in my first 100 days as president i will pass health care reform
2533215 sexual orientation discrimination is hereby over all can now proudly serve in the united states military
2533216 those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolution the first waves of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age we mean to be a part of it we mean to lead it yet the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we in this nation are free free from the dependence on other countries and therefore we intend to be free in short our leadership in science and industry our hopes for peace and security our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort to solve these mysteries to solve them for the good of all men and to become the worlds leading alternative renewable energy producing nation we choose to accomplish this task we choose to accomplish this task in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to accomplish that we must accomplish in order to be free it is for these reasons that i put forth that the decision to shift our efforts in alternative renewable energy from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the presidency
2533217 focused less on the threat and more on the tactics the nation has chosen to deal with the threat
2533218 lead follow or get the hell out of the way
2533219 moreover he needs hillary supporters to see that his aims are their aims
2533220 why do we know details like this about barack obamas life when you havent even scratched the surface of john mccains life when is the last time you informed your viewers about the keating five scandal i am sure that your network has video of what happened to john mccain as a result of this and yet i bet you have not shown one single second of that video during his entire campaign this is a scandal he was involved in while he was in office and you havent even mentioned it during the campaign because youre so obsessed over what barack obama was doing when he was eight years old theres a reason why if you asked ten voters on the street nine of them couldnt tell you what the words keating five mean and that reason is that the media just has not done its job in examining john mccain as a candidate for president you sir are showing your bias in asking questions like the one you just asked me about obama while absolutely refusing to do the same for john mccain is this network owned by the republican party or what
2533221 im not here to say that the government is always right but when the government tells you to do something im sure you would all agree that i think you all recognize that is something you need to do
2533222 the proposed fisa deal is not a compromise it is a capitulation the house and senate should not be taking up this bill which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the presidents illegal program and which fails to protect the privacy of law abiding americans at home allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity and under this bill the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent americans in the u s with no connection to suspected terrorists with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power instead of cutting bad deals on both fisa and funding for the war in iraq democrats should be standing up to the flawed and dangerous policies of this administration
2533223 senator mccain you have made an issue of your military service in your campaign even running ads with pictures of you as a prisoner of war so why have you refused to sign the militarys standard form 180 and by doing so release your full military record to the public senator john kerry was completely unafraid to do this when he ran for president in 2004 why havent you volunteered to do what john kerry willingly did if you are proud of your military record then why hide it why not put it out there for the public to see or is there something in there you dont want the public to find out about arent you as courageous as john kerry senator
2533224 senator mccain your current wife to date has released only two pages from a single year of her tax returns will she ever fully release her tax returns to reporters how are the american people supposed to know if you will have any conflicts of interest if you wont even release your immediate familys tax returns senator obama has released all of his tax returns for recent years which include his wifes income and yet your wife refuses to do so what is she hiding in the tax returns that she has not released are you just afraid taxpayers will find out how wealthy she is or is there a specific reason she has not come forward with this information dont you think the voters need to know where your family gets its money senator
2533225 senator mccain you personally intervened with the pentagon over an air force tanker contract that contract went to northrop grumman and the parent company of the european company airbus now it has been shown that the pentagon did not handle the bidding process properly and it looks like the american company boeing will get another chance at the contract so why did you intervene to send thousands of aerospace jobs overseas senator could it have anything to do with the lobbyist northrop grumman hired who until a month ago was your national finance chairman to put it bluntly this doesnt exactly sound like straight talk sir it sounds like lobbyists buying influence
2533226 senator mccain you abruptly cancelled an appearance at a fundraiser recently the man whose house at which the fundraiser was held clayton williams was quoted while running as a republican for the governor of texas when he made a joke about being raped he actually equated the bad weather at a campaign stop to being raped his exact words talking about the weather and being raped were quote as long as its inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it unquote during the same campaign he compared his opponent ann richards to cattle on his ranch saying he would quote head her and hoof her and drag her through the dirt unquote and yet you senator mccain while you did not appear at his fundraiser have accepted 300 000 which williams raised for you what sort of message to the women of america do you think that sends senator
2533227 if elected you would not be the first man who has been held prisoner of war by an enemy as andrew jackson had that distinction from his participation in the war of 1812 but you would almost assuredly be the first president who had ever been tortured by an enemy yet your views on torture seem to have to put it politely evolved over the past year at first you were strongly against it but then you voted to allow the c i a to use techniques on prisoners held by the united states which if used against you in vietnam would surely have been called torture so what is your stance on torture senator mccain should the united states government limit itself to the procedures outlined in the army field manual or should the c i a be given latitude to use what many call torture against prisoners of the united states in short senator where exactly do you stand on torture and where exactly do you draw the line if as president you discovered that george w bush used the exact techniques on american prisoners as were used against you by the north vietnamese what would you do about it would you tell the american public that such things had been done in their name
2533228 but senator mccain earlier this year 60 minutes aired a clip of you answering the question is waterboarding torture by stating quote sure yes without a doubt unquote you were then asked so the united states has been torturing pows to which you responded yes these are your own words senator
2533229 friday talking points 36 end the medias pro mccain bias now
2533230 go steal that guys laptop its ok im a cop itll be legal
2533231 certainly well help you out with whatever you want once you show us the warrant from the fisa court since that is the only way for us to legally do so
2533232 go steal that guys laptop its ok im a cop itll be legal
2533233 hmmmm maybe all of those people know something that i dont
2533234 i want you to with full public awareness go into that store and steal that candy or i will tell everyone that you previously went into that store and stole that candy
2533235 look st pete ive got a taped interview from 32 a d showing you were
2533236 we looked forward to having a serious debate over the difference between democratic and republican senatorial candidates this fall but it now seems the gop has given up on challenging us in four states we urge voters everywhere to take notice that republicans are already conceding states very early in the process and ask why they should even consider voting gop if the party has publicly given up on them
2533237 the republicans in the house cant even manage to audit their own campaign committee and were bilked out of almost three quarter of a million dollars by the guy they trusted as their treasurer if this is how they handle their own campaign contributions why would anyone vote to put them in power of the nations budget vote for fiscal responsibility this november vote democratic
2533238 well you also have to look at a certain segment of the republican party who is not exactly thrilled about their nominee ron paul raised a lot of money earlier in the race online and he has now told his supporters to back libertarian candidates and everybody knows the ron paul crowd is just as fervent as the hillary or nobody crowd so youve got to wonder how many ron paul supporters are going to vote for bob barr the libertarian nominee or just stay home because in a handful of states this could be crucial to the outcome of the race
2533239 on the other hand hes changed his position on torture so what does john mccain really believe who is he is he just a guy who wants to be president and hell say whats necessary to get the job
2533240 dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of
2533241 by a margin of 52 to 43 percent citizens want congress to impeach president bush if he wiretapped american citizens without a judges approval according to a new poll commissioned by afterdowningstreet org a grassroots coalition that supports a congressional investigation of pres bushs decision to invade iraq in 2003
2533242 this nation sits at a crossroads one direction points to the higher road of the rule of law sometimes hard sometimes unpleasant this path relies on truth justice and the rigorous application of the principle that no man is above the law now the other road is the path of least resistance this is where we start making exceptions to our laws based on poll numbers and spin control this is when we pitch the law completely overboard when the mood fits us when we ignore the facts in order to cover up the truth no man is above the law and no man is below the law thats the principle that we all hold very dear in this country
2533243 there can be no shading of right and wrong the complicated currents that have coursed through this impeachment process are many but after stripping away the underbrush of legal technicalities and nuance i find that the president abused his sacred power by lying and obstructing justice how can parents instill values and morality in their children how can educators teach our children how can the rule of law for every american be applied equally if we have two standards of justice in america one for the powerful and the other for the rest of us
2533244 the suspicion some people have about the presidents motives in this attack on iraq is itself a powerful argument for impeachment
2533245 after months of lies the president has given millions of people around the world reason to doubt that he has sent americans into battle for the right reasons
2533246 there are hillary supporter talking points that state that obama cannot run for president because he was born in hawaii before it became a state
2533247 i made the best decision i could have made with the evidence i had at the time and in accordance with my duties as commander in chief and the authorizations given to me by the us congress
2533248 that the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons
2533249 we may need to curb the harsher operations while icrc is around it is better not to expose them to any controversial techniques
2533250 in the past when the icrc has made a big deal about certain detainees the dod defense department has moved them away from the attention of the icrc
2533251 but the criminal justice system has safeguards to prevent innocent people blaa blaa blaa
2533252 do you honestly believe that these detainees are in there because they stole someones milk money or didnt pay a parking ticket these are some very very bad people
2533253 an eight month mcclatchy investigation in 11 countries on three continents has found that akhtiar was one of dozens of men and according to several officials perhaps hundreds whom the u s has wrongfully imprisoned in afghanistan cuba and elsewhere on the basis of flimsy or fabricated evidence old personal scores or bounty payments
2533254 mcclatchy interviewed 66 released detainees more than a dozen local officials primarily in afghanistan and u s officials with intimate knowledge of the detention program the investigation also reviewed thousands of pages of u s military tribunal documents and other records
2533255 this unprecedented compilation shows that most of the 66 were low level taliban grunts innocent afghan villagers or ordinary criminals at least seven had been working for the u s backed afghan government and had no ties to militants according to afghan local officials in effect many of the detainees posed no danger to the united states or its allies
2533256 oh yes sure there may be one or two that are completely innocent the possibility does exist just like in any criminal prosecution the possibility always exists does that mean we throw out the entire criminal justice system just because it might convict an innocent person
2533257 i said to him that if we come up short and there are some acquittals in our cases it will at least validate the process
2533258 at which point hayness eyes got wide and he said wait a minute we cant have acquittals
2533259 i dont recall seeing this memorandum before and im not even sure this is one ive seen before i dont recall seeing this memorandum and i dont recall specific objections of this nature well i dont recall seeing this document either i dont recall specific concerns i dont recall these and i dont recall seeing these memoranda i cant even read this document but i dont remember seeing it i dont recall that specifically i dont remember doing that i dont recall seeing these things
2533260 you cant be patriotic if you want your fellow americans to die
2533261 warren buffett pays a lower rate in taxes than his secretary does
2533262 senator clinton you have publicly criticized senator obama for his present votes in the senate as if they were not actual votes when in fact present votes are practically the equivalent of no votes in the senate and his abortion related present votes were with the blessing of planned parenthood did you not already know this if you did then why did you attempt to deceive the voters with it and if not then with your 35 years of experience in american politics why not
2533263 senator clinton is committed to having a united democratic party at the end of this process senator obama is committed to having a united democratic party at the end of this process and we will have a united democratic party at the end of this process
2533264 all that negative stuff was penns fault which is why i removed him as campaign leader
2533265 the last weeks of the campaign showed my true feelings and party loyalty after we got rid of the negative influence of mark penn and i urge my supporters to vote for barack obama
2533266 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
2533267 communism is wrong and bad capitalism is good and right
2533268 given the situation in tibet if you were president right now how would you handle the situation during the upcoming beijing olympics
2533269 given that taiwan is a democracy do you support their independence or do you support their dominance by communist china
2533270 are you worried that china could manipulate the dollars value on the world market and what would you do about it
2533271 there is nothing we can do about chinas growing strength
2533272 i can win the general election and obama cant i trust the superdelegates to see this and to award me the nomination
2533273 its all about the sports and it has never been about the politics
2533274 the sportive knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics it doesnt separate but unites the combatants in understanding and respect it also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace thats why the olympic flame should never die
2533275 see you should have trusted me were going to get the troops out
2533276 reported more difficulty accessing behavioral health services but lower stigma associate with seeking care behavorial health personnel reported a shortage of behavioral health assets and higher burnout
2533277 soldiers on their third or fourth deployment were at significantly higher risk than soldiers on their first or second deployment for mental health problems and work related problems
2533278 suicide rates continue to be elevated relative to historic army rates most suicides involve failed relationshiops with spouses or intimate partners
2533279 ratings of unit morale are influenced by gender males report higher unit morale than females rank ncos rate unit morale lower than the e1 e4 group and officers rate unit morale higher than the e1 e 4 group and months in theater a detailed analysis is provided in section 6 3 1 each of these variables however differs from 2006 to 2007 see table 2 therefore to determine whether bct soldiers report changes in unit morale it is necessary to normalize the data on these key variables
2533280 using this breakdown both individual and unit morale significantly increase from 2006 to 2007
2533281 no new taxes for anyone making less than 200 250 000 a year
2533282 why warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary
2533283 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes
2533284 if you actually become president what are you going to do
2533285 ill end the use of signing statements to rewrite the laws congress has passed ill shut down guantanamo disavow torture and restore the right of habeas corpus
2533286 and ill end the practice of using executive privilege as a shield against the publics right to know and congresss duty to oversee the president
2533287 in short starting from day one the bush cheney era will be over in name and in practice
2533288 and ill end the practice of using executive privilege as a shield against the publics right to know
2533289 i just want to get through this crap and go home
2533290 well you know after listening to general petraeus and george bush it seems like their surge strategy should now be called the stall strategy because thats exactly what it now is stalling for time until the next president can clean up this mess
2533291 the united states is not seeking permanent military bases in iraq
2533292 a bush administration official admitted that whenever the president talks about not building permanent bases in iraq the term doesnt really mean anything from a member of his own administration we now are told that anything bush says about not wanting permanent bases in iraq is meaningless if his own administration doesnt believe him on this issue why should any other american
2533293 the bush administration cant even give a straight answer to the question who is our enemy in iraq it seems right now that our enemy is whoever prime minister maliki says is our enemy this is a dangerous state of affairs and needs to end president bush needs to tell america exactly who is our enemy right now in iraq the fact that he cant or wont should speak volumes about the lack of strategy we have for any kind of success in iraq
2533294 for us to walk away from iraq i think would have at least that bad an effect probably worse because if al qaeda were to take over big parts of iraq among other things they would acquire control of a significant oil resource iraq has almost 100 billion barrel reserves producing 2 5 3 million barrels of oil a day if you take a terrorist organization like al qaeda and give it that kind of revenue theres no telling the amount of trouble they could get into
2533295 there is absolutely no chance that al qaeda is going to get its hands on iraqs oil according to every military expert on the planet but that doesnt stop vice president cheney from using the specter of such an outcome to fearmonger the american public once again im really beginning to wonder whether cheney has passed over into what can only be described as clinical delusional behavior
2533296 lets be clear republican plans to give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans when the rest of american families are struggling to pay the rent buy groceries or cover the cost of their healthcare will add billions more to president bushs deficit and cost us the opportunity make needed investments that will create and keep jobs here at home
2533297 we also cannot lose sight of the iraq wars impact on americas economy which is another source of strength of our country this president has taken us into a war that is taking us deeply into debt that can take us into recession
2533298 president bush has shown great wisdom in pushing the iraq quagmire until our democratic nominee whoever it will be is in the white house and can fix the mess he made
2533299 there is absolutely no chance that al qaeda is going to get its hands on iraqs oil according to every military expert on the planet
2533300 the percentage of americans who think that the democrat controlled congress is doing a good job is half of the percentage that thinks bush is doing a good job given that how does it feel dems to know that twice as many americans think that bush is doing a good job than those americans who think that the democrat controlled congress is doing a good job in other words dems bush has yaall beat 2 1 in popularity
2533301 if the president wants to go toe to toe with us on that i say fine lets do it
2533302 president bushs speech on global warming last week was a disaster rather than setting ambitious goals for america to tackle the climate change threat head on and lead the rest of the world towards a solution president bushs plan does absolutely nothing
2533303 if we dont see that happen colleagues of mine are going to take matters into their own hands
2533304 once again the courts have found that the bush administration has been violating the law when it comes to protecting the environment in this case the administration clearly missed the deadline for action to protect the polar bear a deadline they agreed to interior secretary kempthorne like epa administrator stephen johnson has been stonewalling our committee and i am very pleased that the court has ordered the interior department to stop stalling and finalize its decision regarding polar bears these magnificent creatures are in peril and this administration has no right to walk away from protecting them
2533305 well you know insert name of vapid television interviewer here if john mccain was in charge he would completely do away with employer based health care and replace it with absolutely nothing meaning that every american would no longer qualify for a group health plan and would instead be forced to purchase individual health care on the open market this is outrageous to say the least but the true hypocrisy is that mccain decries big government taking over health insurance while he is currently covered by not one but two government run health care plans the veterans administration and his congressional health care plan which are both directly paid for by american taxpayers so since hes so big on everyone buying health care themselves and hes so down on government health care i openly challenge him to immediately opt out of both the va and his senate health care plan and then publicly buy his health care on the open market since he has many pre existing conditions including a recent bout with cancer i doubt he would be able to buy such insurance at any price how about it john mccain stop taking taxpayer money for your own health care if you think its such a horrible thing to do put your money where your mouth is
2533306 actually what john mccain house republicans senate republicans the republican party my republican opponent in the election says is nothing more than a continuation of president bushs disastrous policy weve had to suffer through eight years of bush and we can see the wreckage of the american economy foreign policy americas standing in the world the constitution as a result republicans have had their chance to run this country and what bush and his republican friends did was to run this country into the ground we can change that in november vote to change bushs policies vote democratic
2533307 i spoke to a lot of journalists about how i should speak up here and everyone all the journalists said craig your duty is speak truth to power thats what you do you hold the truth up for everyone to see and i am sorry i dont see it that way that is your job i am a late night television show guy
2533308 the new york times unfortunately did not buy a table they felt that this event undercuts the credibility of the press its funny you see i thought that jayson blair and judy miller took care of that what did i go too far now let me try this shut the hell up new york times you sanctimonious whining jerks
2533309 you know i have here a quote from comedian craig ferguson talking to the white house correspondents shindig last week that id like to read because that last question earned it
2533310 you know if you would just ask the white house some tough questions about constitutional and moral issues the way helen thomas recently did maybe you would be flooded with flowers from an adoring public too
2533311 when president bush took office according to aaa the price of gasoline was 1 49 a few months ago bush said he hadnt heard that gas was going to hit four bucks a gallon soon now it seems like a day doesnt go by without another oil company announcing a record breaking profit i guess maybe putting two oil men in charge of the country wasnt such a bright thing to do huh mission accomplished i guess
2533312 you know what the stimulus checks did and what the gas tax holiday will do they will put america farther into debt and you know what happens when our debt gets bigger other countries push the dollar down and you know what happens when the dollar is weak oil costs more a lot more a third of the cost of gas in america right now is a direct result of the weak dollar politicians have got to realize that going on a spending spree with a bank of china credit card is no way to run a country
2533313 we have lost three specials in a row in areas we normally expect to win clearly we have got problems that are deep and serious in terms of how we are going to do in the fall
2533314 but if the mccain clinton ticket lost hillary would claim she was a
2533315 so you support the troops but you wont pay for their education smells like hypocrisy to me
2533316 l b j got the civil rights act passed not m l k
2533317 some people compare one of the other candidates to john f kennedy but he was assassinated and lyndon baines johnson was the one who actually
2533318 we were not aware that this person was going to make those comments and disapprove of them completely they were totally inappropriate
2533319 the more i look at this im seeing there are a lot of red diaper babies around here
2533320 we decided to start going back and seeing what things influenced him even before he was born
2533321 this is the atmosphere that young barack obama grew up in
2533322 the suggestion that things which happened before i was even born somehow make me a communist is absolutely ridiculous it would be just as ridiculous as me calling the republican party communist because they are shown on the map as red states john mccain and his supporters need a reminder that the cold war is over and has been for almost two decades
2533323 ive noticed that right wing media types are denying that john mccain will be exactly like george bush if he gets into office but the fact is its hard to deny such an obvious statement especially when we find out that john mccain voted with bush one hundred percent of the time last year in the senate doesnt sound much like a maverick to me in fact his voting record shows that he would indeed be exactly like george bush
2533324 john mccain wants to continue george bushs iraq war policy mccain wants to continue bushs other foreign policies mccain wants to make bushs tax policy permanent mccain agrees with bushs domestic agenda as well so if you think the countrys doing great and we should continue the direction george w bush has been taking us for eight years then vote for john mccain because hell give you a third term of bush policies if you want a change then vote for me
2533325 when i say i support the troops i mean it when a bill comes before congress which gives our brave fighting men and women gi benefits which i do not consider too expensive or too generous then i proudly vote for it if george bush vetoes it i will proudly vote to overturn that veto why do bush and john mccain not support our troops the last time this bill came before the senate john mccain wasnt even there for it he was out fundraising instead of doing the job he was elected to do democrats support our troops by allowing them to go to college after their service john mccain and george bush think thats too expensive i do not thats the difference between us when i say i support the troops its not a political slogan i actually support the troops john mccain and george bush should do the same
2533326 i can tell you that it is succeeding i can look you in the eye and tell you its succeeding we have drawn down to pre surge levels basra mosul and now sadr city are quiet and its long and its hard and its tough and there will be setbacks
2533327 either john mccain doesnt know the facts on the ground in iraq or he is continuing the bush administrations pattern of intentionally misleading the public either way he is the wrong choice for americas future
2533328 weve had a long primary race and looking forward to november i welcome any help hillary clinton and president bill clinton will give me on the campaign trail beating john mccain is crucial for this countrys future and i hope to work with the clintons to try to get every vote we can possibly get to elect a democrat to the white house again
2533329 3 isnt it hard to bash mccain when 30 of democrats have stated they are going to vote mccain over obama
2533330 4 as callous as it is to say the mission of the military comes before the needs of military personnel this is something that the troops understand going in so if the bill has provisions that would harm the ability of the military to complete its mission then mccain is right to oppose it
2533331 as for the troops you do the simple deflect and attack that the repubs do and why i changed over to dem recently and why i feel they are losing
2533332 this is not who i am this is not who defines me this is not who i am as a person
2533333 you know what we believe in you its about the issues we believe that on day one youre going to take care of us in terms of jobs the economy the war in iraq as well as these gas prices
2533334 you could all be there right now lending your services but 48 hours have passed since we made this offer and we have received absolutely no response
2533335 hey idiot the voters just dont care and its all youve been talking about for three weeks and have you seen the price of gas lately
2533336 warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary does
2533337 how do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains how high will that 15 percent rate go
2533338 another old white guy or how about a change for the better
2533339 well obamas ad is pretty convincing about how john mccain kicked a puppy once but hillary makes a good point that horns cloven hooves and a tail are visible in photos of mccain they both make a good case its going to be hard to pick one to vote for
2533340 this is why i would make a better president than john mccain
2533341 when a candidate is finally chosen the democratic party will come together
2533342 the more you tighten your grip the more systems shall slip thru your fingers
2533343 when will the iraq army be able to provide security on their own
2533344 see chaos would have happened if bush hadnt sent the surge troops in and this is why american troops need to stay in iraq for a long time to come
2533345 the maliki government is a powerless u s puppet and no matter how long we stay theyre going to have a civil war when we leave keeping troops there just means more american casualties until the inevitable final battle takes place between the iraqis themselves over who will control the country
2533346 see fully training the iraqi army worked victory is possible in iraq we just have to be a little patient while they build on the success in basra
2533347 we told you the british method of pulling back made the most sense when you leave the fighting to the iraqis themselves they are successful this means we should bring the troops home quickly
2533348 we told you the british method of pulling back made the most sense when you leave the fighting to the iraqis themselves they are successful
2533349 well thats fine as long as its not american lives being lost
2533350 barack wins it through default when hillary bows out on may 7
2533351 if i dont get my way im taking my bat and ball and going home
2533352 democrats believe the flying public should not have to check all their rights with their baggage when they fly we strongly support the federal passengers bill of rights and challenge our opponents to do the same or explain why to their voters this fall
2533353 apparently the bush administration feels that its ok to outsource the creation of american passports i guess bush feels that there arent any americans who could be doing this work but it really isnt that surprising when you consider how many american companies have moved their jobs overseas during the bush years to say nothing of the security implications of having foreign companies making supposedly secure passport components
2533354 if president bush can watch the scenes we are seeing on our television screens nightly and say that quote normalcy is returning unquote to the country then why should any american believe anything he says about iraq at all his viewpoint is so divorced from reality its an embarrassment for this country
2533355 is president bush making deals with iraqi prime minister maliki to use the american military in an internal iraqi political struggle i dont think this is what america signed up for in iraq the white house needs to provide some answers about our involvement in basra and whether it is truly targeting only one shiite militia at malikis request while giving others a free hand
2533356 bushs department of agriculture has come up with a novel way of keeping the public safe from tainted meat dont let them know about it boy thatll really help solve the problem and let consumers feel good about the meat they buy is this where fema director michael brown wound up working or what
2533357 baseball fans have rendered their verdict on bushs legacy when he threw out the first pitch the country as a whole obviously wants to move on from the bush years
2533358 a man in texas was just awarded a prize for the best design of the bush library in a contest the
2533359 the road goes on forever and the party never ends
2533360 its going to be over in a matter of days
2533361 north carolina is bigger than indiana and only 25 delegates smaller than ohio
2533362 isnt it ironic that the dems have annointed the good ol boy vote as the most crucial when they tossed aside their very own good ol boy candidate
2533363 to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states
2533364 if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen
2533365 president bush and john mccain think that paying 4 00 a gallon for gasoline isnt enough they both are strongly supportive of military action against iran at some point in the near future mccain has even joked about it on the campaign trail but its no joke if america attacks iran we could easily be faced with a doubling of gas prices in this country and thats definitely no joke at the gas pump
2533366 americans were lied to by president bush about the costs of the war in iraq and look where we are as a result so if bush or john mccain stands before the american people and tries to convince the public that bombing iran would be a good idea heres the question that supporters of such a policy should be asked if you support attacking iran would you be willing to pay 8 00 a gallon for gasoline as part of the price of such an attack
2533367 john mccain will change any position and say anything just to get elected president his flip flopping on issues large and small should be exposed to the american public for what it truly is pandering for votes i just wish the media would give him the same level of scrutiny they routinely give to every word that democrats say lets end the free ride in the media for mccain we dont want a flip flopper in chief we want a president who says what he means and means what he says a real straight talker not a flip flopper on an express bus to panderville
2533368 i guess putting politics above competence worked out so well for president bush when fema tried to deal with hurricane katrina in new orleans that he is using the same model to run the epa its no wonder that nobody believes a word he says about fighting global warming when his political minions wont let epa scientists do their jobs in telling us how bad things are good enough for fema good enough for the epa as far as george bush is concerned heckuva job georgie
2533369 did you get that question straight from the pentagon i find it incredible that a story broke last week about your so called military experts which showed how they profit from parroting the pentagons talking points you pass them off as some sort of independent analysts and your own news organization was not only silent on this story you seem to still have the same retired generals on your payroll maybe you should put up a graphic whenever these generals appear which says not military expert but rather paid propaganda from the pentagon it would certainly be more honest
2533370 do you actually think the american people care that much about this non story perhaps you were too busy following this monumentally trivial so called news to follow up on how torture was approved by meetings which held numerous cabinet members from the bush administration and that bush himself approved john ashcroft even said during one of these meetings history will not judge this kindly answer me this how much reporting did you do on this story versus how much you did on what you just asked me about the american people deserve better from their media than they are getting
2533371 riots in denver at the democrat sic convention would see to it that we dont elect democrats
2533372 heckuva job gore you not only created the internet but you are also responsible for massive world wide food shortages heckuva job
2533373 you mean to insult me there is no dishonor in not knowing everything
2533374 are you a regime change kind of guy or a conduct change man
2533375 i just think that they are terribly misguided and that their national security strategy has been an abject failure
2533376 but when they are in positions of power and are censoring government scientists who work for you me and everybody then i have a huge problem
2533377 i dont know whether it would be fascinating or utterly depressing to peer ahead 100 years into the historical interpretation of the bush administration i would only hope that people wouldnt still be suffering from the long terms effects of it
2533378 if you are suggesting that john mccain would make a find sec def in an obama administration then we are bound to have some very interesting
2533379 mccain is too partisan in that respect just not in his dna so to speak
2533380 after the choice of the president the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice president
2533381 when the united states did not exist when we were just colonies
2533382 our plan cuts payroll taxes both for businesses and for 94 of american workers the remaining 6 would just be paying their fair share the same flat tax percentage everyone else pays how can the republicans be against a tax cut for 94 of americans
2533383 between 200 and 250 000 for the upper income limit that he is now pledging not to raise taxes on
2533384 i certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was 28 percent
2533385 the two candidates are the same on all the issues
2533386 in florida a number of revote options were proposed i am not aware of any that you supported
2533387 i have a tendency to comment on blogs and posts that i have not bothered to read in full its a very bad habit that gets me into trouble sometimes
2533388 seriously you guys are the masters at producing ads like this and have been for decades
2533389 why wont the media ask what cindy mccain is hiding why wont she release her tax returns in his famous
2533390 boy how times have changed eh from the concept of a candidates wife having a quote respectable republican cloth coat unquote to cindy mccain you think maybe cindy mccains worn a mink coat or two in her life the republicans have become the true elitist party as evidenced by cindy mccain trying to hide her enormous wealth from the public how is it that mr straight talk mccain cant even get his own wife to release her tax returns
2533391 mccains policies are the old way of doing business in washington
2533392 mccain seems to have a twentieth century viewpoint which is not what american needs to go into the future
2533393 barack obama has the youth of america excited in a way we havent seen for decades of course john mccain remembers the last time this happened
2533394 john mccain said recently we needed a league of nations now i know the league of nations was around when he was a child but most of us know that the united nations now exists
2533395 john mccain said recently that we should put missiles in czechoslovakia which is interesting since that country hasnt existed for over a decade perhaps he was just going from his own memories of the cold war i dont know
2533396 i think the american people are going to say in this election out with the old in with the new
2533397 are you better off now than you were eight years ago vote democratic in 2008
2533398 when george bush entered office the price of gas was 1 49 we cant afford any more republicans running this country like this vote democratic in 2008
2533399 republicans have become so obsessed with obstructionism and so blind to the voters wish that congress get something done that they actually voted against honoring mothers day this is a disgrace the washington post ran a story about it with the headline i mean what is next are the republicans going to come out against apple pie too america deserves better than this vote democratic in 2008 you know why because democrats love their mothers but apparently 178 house republicans dont
2533400 yes considering there could have been many more thousands of terrorist causalities here in the us
2533401 are suing blackwater under a wrongful death claim in civil court
2533402 investigating whether blackwater played a role in a weapons smuggling case linked to the kurdish militant group pkk a u s designated terrorist organization
2533403 the republicans can whine about quotes out of context all they want the mccain quote is in context
2533404 the dnc ad conveys is the opposite of what mccain said
2533405 whoa daddy i guess i just explained why talking points are so effective if i talk long enough i can disprove anything i say
2533406 for example he should try explaining to the troops and vets of the war in iraq and afghanistan for that matter how exactly he expects to keep us forces in iraq at the numbers he suggested for 100 years given that the army and marine corps are currently at the breaking point and the mission in afghanistan is circling the drain and thats just for starters
2533407 if you hear it three times you are much more likely to remember it
2533408 two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun
2533409 i voted for the war before i voted against it
2533410 check out how many people still believe saddam had wmd s that were a threat to the united states
2533411 if iran were to attack israel then i would order iran obliterated
2533412 again i have to use the illustration of us forces in germany and japan
2533413 our office recently concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations
2533414 authority for use of military force to combat terrorist activities within the united states
2533415 the recent disclosures underscore the bush administrations extraordinarily sweeping conception of executive power
2533416 the administrations lawyers believe the president should be permitted to violate statutory law to violate international treaties and even to violate the fourth amendment inside the u s they believe that the president should be above the law
2533417 each time one of these memos comes out you have to come up with a more extreme way to characterize it
2533418 no country has ever been saved by good men because a good man will not go the the lengths or depths necessary
2533419 no great country was ever saved by good men because good men will not go to the lengths that may be necessary
2533420 this world is a comedy to those that think a tragedy to those that feel
2533421 this world is a comedy to those that think a tragedy to those that feel
2533422 if you are not a democrat at 20 yrs old you have no heart if you are not a republican at 40 you have no brain
2533423 look we have had these bombings we know of your hatred of anything military so we would like to talk to your group to make sure you had nothing to do with it
2533424 our office recently concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations
2533425 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2533426 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that i will obey the orders of the president of the united states and the orders of the officers appointed over me according to regulations and the uniform code of military justice so help me god
2533427 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability
2533428 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter
2533429 law is often but the tyrants will and always so when it violates the right of an individual
2533430 an equal application of law to every condition of man is fundamental
2533431 a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever
2533432 the right of a nation to kill a tyrant in cases of necessity can no more be doubted than to hang a robber or kill a flea but killing one tyrant only makes way for worse unless the people have sense spirit and honesty enough to establish and support a constitution guarded at all points against the tyranny of the one the few and the many
2533433 i would rather die by my ideals than to live by my compromise
2533434 those who ignore the deadly tyrants that would enslave and butcher are nothing but slaves themselves
2533435 i am not going to let fear rule my actions
2533436 if we wait til there are midnight knocks at the door it will be too late
2533437 i want you to list the rights that you personally have lost
2533438 its actually ironic in a sad sort of way the left and al qaeda have the same exact opinion of america and the bush administration
2533439 restitution for world war ii internment of japanese americans and aleuts
2533440 americans were responsible for about three quarters of the 335 incidents between 1980 and 2000 that the fbi has classified as suspected or confirmed terrorism
2533441 lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided
2533442 the killing of jews and americans is one of the biggest duties
2533443 lord if i could only have talked to hitler all this might have been avoided
2533444 bringing up hitler in an argument on a blog comment thread is one thing but bringing up hitler to bolster your argument in front of the knesset is a whole different ballgame
2533445 mr president and mr prime minister thank you for inviting me to speak at the knesset tomorrow i hear its a place of many a sharp elbow laughter im looking forward to giving my speech laughter im not going to be throwing any elbows
2533446 all the superdelegates who have been getting off the fence and making their endorsement known
2533447 this is bullshit this is malarkey this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement
2533448 hes the guy whos weakened us hes the guy thats increased the number of terrorists in the world his policies have produced this vulnerability the united states has his intelligence community pointed that out not me the nie has pointed that out and what are you talking about is he going to fire condi rice condi rice has talked about the need to sit down so his first two appeasers are rice and gates i hope he comes home and does something
2533449 need to figure out a way to develop some leverage and then sit down and talk with them
2533450 this is the same president who talks about appeasement the same one who asks me to get on a plane and talk to qaddafi
2533451 the same president who made a deal with qaddafi he writes letters dear mr chairman to kim jong il
2533452 we should take zero backseat to this pres talking about appeasement under him israel is less safe
2533453 president bush got it exactly right today when he warned about the threat of iran and its terrorist proxies like hamas and hezbollah
2533454 it is time to turn the page on eight years of policies that have strengthened iran and failed to secure america or our ally israel
2533455 instead of tough talk and no action we need to do what kennedy nixon and reagan did and use all elements of american power including tough principled and direct diplomacy to pressure countries like iran and syria
2533456 george bush knows that i have never supported engagement with terrorists and the presidents extraordinary politicization of foreign policy and the politics of fear do nothing to secure the american people or our stalwart ally israel
2533457 im a strong believer in civility and im a strong believer in a bipartisan foreign policy but that cause is not served with dishonest divisive attacks of the sort that weve seen out of george bush and john mccain over the last couple days
2533458 naive and irresponsible belief that tough talk from washington will somehow cause iran to give up its nuclear program and support for terrorism
2533459 they arent telling you the truth they are trying to fool you and scare you because they cant win a foreign policy debate on the merits
2533460 but its not going to work not this time not this year
2533461 president bushs comparison of any democrat to nazi appeasers is offensive and outrageous on the face of it especially in light of his failures in foreign policy
2533462 this is the kind of statement that has no place in any presidential address
2533463 i have differences with sen obama on certain foreign policy matters but i think we are united in our opposition to the bush policies and to the continuation of those policies by sen mccain
2533464 i disagree that any president would ever meet with a leader of a country which we have such deep and profound differences as iran for example however i believe there should be diplomatic engagement which president bush has resisted from the very beginning so i think that i have more in common with sen obama and the democratic position in our understanding of what we have to do to re engage with the world
2533465 you know we have a protocol sort of a custom informally around here that we dont criticize the president when he is on foreign soil
2533466 one would think that that would apply to the president that he would not criticize americans when he is on foreign soil
2533467 i think what the president did in that regard is beneath the dignity of the office of president and unworthy of our representation at that observance in israel and i would hope that any serious person would disassociate himself from the presidents remarks who aspires to leadership in our country
2533468 the engineer of the worst foreign policy in our nations history has fired yet another reckless and reprehensible round
2533469 more than seven years into his presidency and in the sixth year of the directionless iraq war president bush has yet to learn that his brand of divisive partisan rhetoric is precisely what has made america and our allies less secure
2533470 president bushs own actions demonstrate that he believes negotiations at the right moment under the right conditions and with the right leaders can both show strength and produce results
2533471 he has relied on negotiations with north korea and libya two state sponsors of terror and by conducting discussions with russia china libya north korea and iran in recent years president bush has demonstrated his belief that negotiations can be a tool to advance america and israels national security interests
2533472 to explain the inconsistency between his administrations actions and his words
2533473 is still playing the disgusting and dangerous political game karl rove perfected which is insulting to every american and disrespectful to our ally israel george bush should be making israel secure not slandering barack obama from the knesset
2533474 bushs outrageous comments are an embarrassment to our country not based in fact and bring us no closer to our goal of ending terrorist attacks against israel and bringing peace to the region
2533475 if john mccain is really serious about being a different kind of republican hell denounce these remarks in the strongest terms possible
2533476 it is an attack on sen obamas position that we should not be avoiding even those we disagree with when it comes to negotiations and diplomacy
2533477 the tradition has always been that when a u s president is overseas partisan politics stops at the waters edge president bush has now taken that principle and turned it on its head for this white house partisan politics now begins at the waters edge no matter the seriousness and gravity of the occasion does the president have no shame
2533478 friday talking points 32 democrats throw bush a few elbows
2533479 diplomatic talks before force is taken is normally the best idea
2533480 let he who has never uttered the word bullshit in his entire life cast the first stone
2533481 you know what i love america and i will keep her safe and anyone who tells you differently is a liar
2533482 wow i wonder what would have happened if kerry had done this
2533483 some people suggest if the united states would just break ties with israel all our problems in the middle east would go away
2533484 can you give me one example of anyone who actually says this
2533485 wow this guy is leading a fight within america to keep america israels ally that must mean whoever his opposition is wants to cut all ties with israel
2533486 you dont negotiate with your friends you negotiate with your enemies
2533487 all that freedom talk is malarkey we deal with the world on a situational basis if a country has oil that matters if a country has nukes that matters if a country is trying to get nukes that matters if the countrys leader happens to be named castro that for some bizarre reason matters if a country is the enemy of our biggest trading partner that matters and well even go along with them and not even call the enemy a country it all just kind of depends you know democracy and freedom and human rights are all great for speeches but where the rubber meets the road its all about other priorities
2533488 i cant describe it but i know it when i see it
2533489 we believe that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights
2533490 the fight against terror and extremism is the defining challenge of our time it is more than a clash of arms it is a clash of visions a great ideological struggle on the one side are those who defend the ideals of justice and dignity with the power of reason and truth on the other side are those who pursue a narrow vision of cruelty and control by committing murder inciting fear and spreading lies
2533491 defend the ideals of justice and dignity with the power of reason and truth
2533492 some people suggest if the united states would just break ties with israel all our problems in the middle east would go away
2533493 for the sake of peace the world must not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon
2533494 i would never belong to a club that would have me as a member
2533495 necessity may require us to take actions in defense of democracy which will stray from democracys own foundational commitments to dignity the best way to minimize harms is to maintain a clear distinction in our minds between what necessity can justify and what the morality of dignity can justify and never to allow the justifications of necessity risk threat imminent danger to dissolve the morally problematic character of necessary measures
2533496 yea i know i have been trying to get my fellow americans to cut back but ya know they just love their freedom if you have any suggestions on how i can rule my country please let me know
2533497 yea how about i shove my fat boot up your skinny ass hay secdef release the hounds
2533498 the israeli supreme court has ruled that an agent of the state may make a defense of necessity is accused of torturing someone this excuse might mitigate the penalty for violating the law but it would not excuse the torture itself which remains criminal

2533514 este es un gran paso para que serbia ocupe un lugar en europa a donde el pa s pertenece serbia ahora debe llevar a cabo este juicio recomendaciones sobre los niveles futuros de soldados que incluyen importantes reducciones en nuestras fuerzas de combate si las condiciones lo permiten
2533515 no se lograr un proceso de paz ni en este ni en los pr ximos a os israel respaldado por estados unidos no pretende cumplir con las exigencias b sicas del pueblo palestino la creaci n de un estado independiente y por lo tanto recurrimos a las actividades militares para presionar a la ocupaci n y lograr nuestro objetivo utilizando un m todo alternativo
2533516 condenamos firmemente esta decisi n del ministerio de defensa de permitir nuevos asentamientos en cisjordania en el valle jord n no es del inter s del pueblo israel ni del p blico israel tener nuevos asentamientos mientras tenemos negociaciones con palestinos acerca de tener dos estados
2533517 termin con las negociaciones de an polis ayer cuando declar que no hab a ninguna posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo antes de fin de a o destruy las negociaciones de an polis al declarar que jerusal n no es parte de la discusi n y hoy probablemente proporcion las municiones para aniquilar por completo el proceso de an polis olmert est retir ndose en medio de fracasos pero su mayor fracaso es que ha demostrado que hasta el momento no hay ning n socio para la paz en israel
2533518 la misi n consiste en entrar a gaza sin pasar por el territorio de israel o de egipto navegando desde las aguas internacionales directamente hasta gaza esto no se ha hecho desde 1967 y hay motivos para pensar que nadie va a interferir en esto porque israel dijo que ya no est ocupando gaza as que queremos ponerlo a prueba

2533520 se plantearon docenas de ideas acerca de c mo provocar la guerra la que me interes m s fue por qu no construimos nosotros en nuestro astillero cuatro o cinco botes que se parezcan a los botes pt iran es colocarles sellos de la armada con muchas armas y la pr xima vez que uno de los botes ingrese en el estrecho de hormuz comenzar un tiroteo podr a costar algunas vidas y fue rechazado porque no se puede hacer que estadounidenses maten estadounidenses ese es el nivel de cosas del que estamos hablando provocaci n pero eso fue rechazado
2533521 los centros de fusi n son parte de una tendencia mucho m s amplia aqu una tendencia del movimiento de nuestras naciones hacia la sociedad de vigilancia donde nuestros movimientos y cada transacci n que hagamos es vigilada y examinada en busca de indicios de comportamiento sospechoso y ese tipo de visi n de c mo hacer cumplir la ley c mo detener el terrorismo se transforma en una justificaci n de llevar un registro de todos nosotros en nuestras vidas cotidianas
2533522 no me sorprender a que haya visto algunas encuestas en las que hayamos ca do un poco como consecuencia del viaje hemos estado fuera del pa s durante una semana a las personas les preocupa el precio de la gasolina les preocupan las ejecuciones hipotecarias el motivo por el que cre que este viaje era importante es porque estoy convencido de que muchos de los problemas que afrontamos en nuestro pa s no ser n resueltos tan eficazmente a menos que tengamos socios fuertes en el extranjero

2533530 i believe it is my responsibility as an israeli who lives in a society that allows occupation to say no more we hope the excursion will open a new channel to the strip
2533531 international law gives israel every right to inspect us for weapons but beyond that they have no right to delay us in any way any siege especially one that is aimed against civilians is illegal
2533532 it is currently unclear how long the boating trip will last because we havent decided whether to use sails or motors in any case fuel must be conserved for the trip back in case the navy detains us for a while
2533533 i have decided to participate in the event in order to say in a clear voice to barak and olmert you will not do this in my name
2533534 if we succeed in breaking the siege once more ships and boats will come and a channel will open between gaza and the outside world that can also transfer assistance and supplies
2533535 the israeli government is attempting to present us as eccentric but i think it will be trapped because it cant stop us
2533536 as a palestinian i am appalled at the ongoing situation in gaza and shaken at the international communitys disregard for human rights in this case
2533537 i think people must take action and so i have decided to participate in this symbolic boating trip
2533538 we had a feeling we had missed out i hope this time we are able to get the message across that there is a siege on gaza any logical person can understand that the gaza strip is under israeli control
2533539 i wasnt sure i had really seen what i thought i had
2533540 it was strange i hadnt encountered anything like it before i wanted to make sure so i asked the cashier what the discount was and why he was not giving it to me
2533541 he insisted that it wasnt a discount but i said cancel the purchase and scan it again so he relented and said its a discount only for minorities
2533542 i asked him what it meant and he said a discount only for arabs i said what do you mean if i was arab you would give me a discount he said yes definitively it was really strange i decided not to argue and to forgo the discount so i paid full price for the products i had purchased
2533543 i didnt expect to get a discount but i was appalled when i realized that had i been arab i would have received one i tried to think what would happen if it was a discount only for jews or sephardim or ashkenazim
2533544 home center offers a wide range of attractive discounts throughout the year as part of a plan to target specific communities the chain offers different discounts for different sectors from time to time

2533550 we were informed by the city that there were no emergency shelter beds available for them so we stopped
2533551 with the drug dealers come violence weapons and intimidation and it turns into an ugly situation quite quickly
2533552 the main concern with that is the negative experiences people have already had with private security the folks here have a serious level of mistrust
2533553 if more shelters dont open soon there is going to be tent city this fall whether we like it or not
2533554 its dangerous for the users and the people around it
2533555 they were mainly newborns we are now working in conjunction with wild arc animal rehabilitation centre
2533556 what i have heard is that it is malnutrition they were just not getting the nourishment they need
2533557 so now we have put mineral licks and salt licks in the forest and we hope that will give them the nourishment that they need
2533558 the deer are not going to go away they are part of the landscape its part of the lovely atmosphere here and we have to make sure they are ok
2533559 i did think it was a little strange having that many on the golf course but it may be that people see more clearly on a golf course
2533560 we have had a lot of young deer come through this year and a lot of them are in poor condition
2533561 the roars of the anfield crowd at the close were solely of defiance

2533568 when a company arrived into fob delhi the frontline was 200m away and they were fighting for the first two months intense fighting
2533569 now with the assistance of the marine expeditionary unit meu theyve been able to push the taliban south and the local community of darvisham are back into the town again
2533570 it wasnt long after a company arrived there that meu conducted their operation in the south
2533571 the taliban were completely caught off guard and the command and control were clearly overwhelmed with the speed and reaction of the isaf international security assistance force troops
2533572 the businesses have opened shops are trading people are back into their houses and farmers are back in the fields
2533573 this is genuinely something we didnt expect to see in the six months we were there for us its massive progress in garmsir
2533574 its that far away from civilisation that if anyones going to attack we can see them for kilometres
2533575 it is about making progress its not about body bags its about improving the lot for people who have to live there

2533577 there are a lot of holes out here that are almost unplayable they are a little ridiculous
2533578 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2533579 this is the hardest golf course ive ever played so if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2533580 look ive got two more rounds to go so ive got to play this thing two more times and i dont really want to go into whether or not its fair
2533581 it was one of those days in a major championship where you just grind it out
2533582 i was hitting good and a few holes where i had been hitting 3 wood the wind was good enough today that i could go ahead and get over all the bunkers
2533583 that was the goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team
2533584 ive put myself in a situation where i have a chance you can play for your country and to do it in your home state that would be a dream come true
2533585 this is a major its not supposed to be easy
2533586 were pushed to the limit but things can happen at any time so i just hope that i got rid of my bad moments today

2533592 i dont know that that would be a time to need or desire to shut all my options off it wouldnt mean that i couldnt sign with them at the end of the year ive been here for a long time and im willing to stay anytime the team comes to you to talk youre always going to listen but thats about as far as i can go because nothing has ever come about

2533600 the individual pursuit is my number one goal it would be the icing on the cake theres been a lot of ups and downs it would mean the world to me to be on the top of the dais ill do everything i can to get there im in great shape and in a great space so i cant see why i cant do it
2533601 its totally different to what im doing at the olympics but to back it up four days in a row on the road and be strong even on the last day shows ive hit some pretty good form and im in good condition i couldnt ask for a better way to lead into this final phase
2533602 ive had no trouble at all it doesnt even enter my mind now it feels like so long ago that its a waste of energy even thinking about it
2533603 its just matter of doing the fine tuning on the track hes shown from when he decided he was going to target the individual pursuit at the start of this season that hes in the class of the rest of the riders who hes up against
2533604 whenever hes set target times during the season hes done it every time everythings going really well its a matter of getting things right over the next few weeks and we should be able to deliver him in pretty good form to compete strongly for a medal
2533605 im going to do everything i can to set myself up for gold in the individual pursuit
2533606 the beauty about the individual pursuit is that i control absolutely everything
2533607 with this batch of racing behind us the whole team is going to come up a level you cant replicate this type of racing in your training its so much harder than anything youd ever done thats one big thing that will be on our side going into beijing
2533608 all the boys were fizzing meeting up in bordeaux with the rest of the team its a great vibe and everyones in a really good space
2533609 i wont be finished after this year definitely its a pretty important time in my life mentally im more mature and can handle a lot more certain things dont get to me like they used to thats why im starting to go good now
2533610 if a bit of luck goes our way we can definitely get to be on top of the dais thats for sure
2533611 when we initially left we got to the lights and i said to him have you still got the piece with you he said no
2533612 so we drove back got the piece delivered him to the hospital and they reattached it
2533613 he was losing a bit of blood as you do with the nerves that run into the tips of your fingers i made sure he was well and he was looked after

2533616 il calore rappresenta il nemico numero uno del pc e di tutti i suoi componenti
2533617 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like
2533618 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2533619 ive had letters before from the bass player in some local band who is pissed off because i said his record is crap but ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact he was great to talk to and no matter what i think of those songs other people clearly love them because hes sold over 150 million records
2533620 he was undefeated in 21 fights so i do feel fortunate that im not living in new york so he cant come around and smack me one
2533621 given the absence of wood in the miserable tv3 building i allow myself to touch a wood product ie paper because im usually carrying scripts im covered
2533622 sometimes i leave it at home and it feels really odd to do the show without it
2533623 i had lucky silks lucky sticks i always put my right boot on first i always folded the the tags on my towels inwards
2533624 i had a mad mother i was brought up with things like never put shoes on the table even when theyre new i still do those things

2533626 when the sceptics conference opened on year on a friday 13th we had a ladder parked over the entrance doorway and everyone came through under it we also had a box of mirror glass to break chain mail letters to ignore salt to spill umbrellas to open inside it was the one onference where all the speakers ran to time
2533627 for cultural reasons and often because the money is collected for a good cause
2533628 i got to the point of thinking that being told to be wary of someone simply because they were a scorpio was as distasteful as being told to be wary of samoans or jews
2533629 its terrible weve been warning the police about this for some time now and nothing has been done
2533630 this is the only country in the world as far as we know where youre allowed to do this its bloody disgusting
2533631 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are
2533632 weve got a system in place that is trusting people to do the right thing
2533633 theres nothing stopping them from saying i saw his licence its your word against theirs
2533634 i would expect the police to be looking at this and the minister national will be looking at this if we get in later this year
2533635 we need to put 6 000 people in this place and there is no reason that we cant do it we need help from the community it is a good way for the community to back jason and hockey for youngstown

2533642 why do you keep buying things that you dont need
2533643 turn around right now and you tell them you made a mistake
2533644 goddamnit you crazy son of a bitch this better be your first experiment in lying to me
2533645 you told me if i wanted this i better start being serious and i better start with
2533646 its too soon and if youre fucking around right now ill peel off your skin cover you in fireants and honey and set fire to the rest
2533647 its important ill fill you in when its over just finish what you have to ill still be right here and take a walk to cool off or something youre not acting like yourself
2533648 well you could try explaining to him that we fulfill different needs for you
2533649 this is not how this should be any of it
2533650 are you fucking mad you just gated into a secure area and entirely compromised it
2533651 jesus baby you didnt even change yet and youre getting blood all over the carpet damn it
2533652 i just i just did the unthinkable and you you
2533653 the emotional firecracker and the immovable practicality i often wish you had at least one grain of detached intellect that could go on autopilot at times like this instead of your rollercoaster conclusions
2533654 and if youre going to start breaking stuff go outside
2533655 i forgot this and now im going back to work
2533656 so what sort of mutilated thing do you think hell drag back to you
2533657 it wont have skin on it im sure lets give him a few hours to exhaust himself then well get some rope i know somebody that wants to test some new chloroform much safer than leaving him loose like this
2533658 youre about to take the only thing i care about and im supposed to stay calm
2533659 im only gonna take this off if you promise to behave yourself okay
2533660 how could you think i wouldnt be livid when i catch you red handed trying to run off with my my woman and how could you do that were practically youre like my brother
2533661 how long have you two been planning this right in front of me right behind my back
2533662 would you like me to count off the times you had something better to do and you left me with him or you sent me to him on things you didnt want to deal with or all the times you left me places and rebroke my heart just just because you could
2533663 and you never once thought all the times that you encouraged a friendship something else might happen
2533664 you really didnt know what you were doing you decided it was okay for me to fuck your wife when you were too busy for that too but not to actually give a shit about her
2533665 thats a pity i thought you knew i was in love with her its not like i never told you before
2533666 id much rather she was in love with both of us rather than sit up wondering if it means anything at all to her wondering if in her head one of us is just a cheap slut shes using for amusement and cant wait to toss aside when something newer comes along
2533667 based on your behaviour this last year maybe you deserve to be with some dumb bitch thats fucking everything in three zip codes

2533670 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2533671 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that

2533733 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2533734 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2533735 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2533736 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2533737 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2533738 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2533739 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2533740 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2533794 its funny you should call just now because i was about to call you weve had a sighting of the suspects in kentish town
2533795 i dont know what happened there mark are you sure it wasnt like that before
2533796 its as if none of you can think of anything except yourselves
2533797 you cant communicate with each other or with anyone else
2533798 you dont know yourselves you dont know each other you dont know the world
2533799 without me you have fallen scattered blown apart as if carried by the four winds
2533800 well if you forget about statistics for a moment and ask yourself instead what is the likelihood of us all having the same dream you would instinctively answer that it is not very likely at all and you would be right to do so but its like my dice theory
2533801 its quite simple if you repeat something enough times the laws of probability cease to apply if you roll a dice enough times eventually it will settle on one number and every time you roll it will be that number for ever more
2533802 right no matter how you throw it and what i am saying is that dreams work in a similar way
2533803 that mathematics doesnt know what the fuck its on about
2533804 because i spent weeks looking at you thinking you were unattractive and flat chested
2533805 because i had a finger in your sister a few weeks ago
2533806 because i am harbouring your mothers killers in my home
2533807 what are your plans now you said you would be thinking about moving on once the dust had settled on the funeral
2533808 but ive not really thought it through are you trying to get rid of me or something
2533809 but if youre always this quiet and dull its no wonder youre single
2533810 like get a bench or get an asteroid named after her or something
2533811 she hated it she said it was too small and too low you cant read it she said and the writing blended with the background as well
2533812 what would happen we would find a carpenter on the internet pay him to make the bench get a plaque done call the council its lazy impersonal
2533813 whats all this about being personal all of a sudden like you were ever the model daughter
2533814 what the fucking hell are you on about who the fuck is rod
2533815 okay so were saying the bench is a bad idea
2533816 maybe we could think about putting it where more people could see it though
2533817 this might sound crazy but what if we used the tree
2533818 we could chop it down chop it up and carve a statue of mum out of it it wouldnt matter if it wasnt perfect it wouldnt be lazy and it would involve us communicating with each other thats what she wanted in the dream wasnt it
2533819 so were agreed well build a statue of mum and a big one at that well all work on it itll be like fucking babel
2533820 triple time if you finish or i kill you if you dont
2533821 hey steve guess what the nasty men are taking poor marks things

2533827 i dont know the police said it should be any day now they said it took a while because its so difficult to dust skin for fingerprints
2533828 i dont know they say they got all they needed
2533829 but can you imagine it wed have to cry wouldnt we theyd tell us to cry so as to make people more likely to call in
2533830 i hope you dont mind me coming over unannounced im taking over as your police liaison officer i just wanted to meet you all and to see if youd thought anymore about the public appeal
2533831 we were just talking about that we decided if you think its a good idea and if itll help find the men who did this well do it
2533832 do you understand me do not even think about fucking moving or i will hunt you down and kill you
2533833 have as many as you want but stay the fuck here
2533834 i mean i appreciate it but well the thing is this isnt my phone
2533835 yeah no i mean it meant a lot to me well not that much i mean this is just as good better better im pleased with this its great um so thanks
2533836 a week ago today at a little before one in the afternoon a terrible crime was committed
2533837 valerie barrett was murdered in her own home during a burglary
2533838 janice pine a family friend arrived at the scene at this point around 12 50 pm
2533839 if you see these men do not approach them they are considered armed and highly dangerous this was an horrendous crime that resulted in the death of a dedicated mother of four if you witnessed anything on that day not matter how trivial you might think it is let us know if you have any idea about the whereabouts of these men please let us know you can call with any information on the number on the bottom of your screen now thank you
2533840 was a peaceful religious woman who wouldnt have harmed a fly
2533841 please if you know anything anything at all call the number and let the police know
2533842 im after you fuckers im going to hunt you down
2533843 well whatever way you look at it weve got a problem
2533844 but this fucking guy rowan going crazy on tv its no good it means people will pay attention to be on the news and everything im sure son of murdered woman goes crazy on tv that means our pictures will be all over the place
2533845 i might have idea ive got a cousin we could stay at his for a while
2533846 right in one youre going to do me a little favour dearest cousin of mine
2533847 they think the men who killed dad are the same as the ones that killed that poor woman
2533848 it doesnt matter how or who did it or what the details are it might seem like it matters but it doesnt
2533849 when they talk about who killed him it means theyre still saying his name jill it makes it sound like he like he is still alive
2533850 thats the funniest thing ive heard in ages i bet she ate you for breakfast
2533851 is she i mean um i dont know how to put this is she
2533852 mrs pine has been working with our e fit team to produce the images of the two men you are seeing on your screen now we believe them to be steven slater and simon sanders two known associates of the deceased sean sutton
2533853 steven this is my cousin mark well be staying with him for a week or two
2533854 you get yourself back to work and ill have dinner ready when you get back
2533855 and i mean this from the bottom of my heart if the police ever ever turn up when im at your place i will kill you
2533856 its nice to know i can help people but yeah some cases can really get to you
2533857 i bet its hard to socialise i had a friend in the police
2533858 he was always saying how hard it is to hold down a relationship
2533859 he said that the police often dated other police because they understood each other or something
2533860 you must be kidding i havent had one of those in years
2533861 it must be difficult to work all day in something like this and go home alone at the end of it
2533862 do you think youll catch them the men simon and steve
2533863 i wouldnt want to get your hopes up unduly but i wouldnt want to lie either the more we know about the criminals the greater the chance of catching them in this case we know everything so there is a very high chance theyll be caught
2533864 but you have to remember what its really about catching a criminal is down to high quality police work not probability
2533865 the point of this was supposed to be that it would be easy straight in straight out no hassle
2533866 maybe we should try the hospitals or the police even
2533867 i mean on any other day we wouldnt have thought twice about rowan not turning up at home would we how often does he do this every other night at least
2533868 how would you know its not like youre ever home either
2533869 i think shed rather we found her youngest dont you
2533870 sean you take that one steve you take that one ill have a look in here
2533871 look ill be straight with you were here to rob your house you can either let us get on with it or we can hurt you
2533872 a friend of a friend you know his name was tim richardson he was a scouser i think anyway this guy tim he was in a plane flying somewhere out east china or something about halfway into the flight there was some turbulence nothing too bad at first but over the course of half an hour it got worse and worse suddenly the plane started dropping straight out of the sky thirty five thousand feet thirty thousand feet twenty five thousand feet just like that like a stone at about five thousand feet the pilot managed to pull up but not enough the plane still came down just not as hard as it could have done there were two hundred people on that plane simon and tim fucking richardson survived
2533873 steve what the fuck has that got to do with sean
2533874 did timothy richardson fall down the stairs in that crash
2533875 did he end up wrapped round someone as if he was in some kind of old woman porn
2533876 fucking great that is steve so whats the conclusion seans got a one in two hundred chance of surviving
2533877 you always have to take into account the observer effect
2533878 lets say i was going to follow you everywhere to study your behaviour
2533879 if i tell you im going to watch everything you do you wouldnt behave the same way as if you didnt know i was watching you right
2533880 so the odds of you i dont know walking around naked would be reduced right
2533881 its just an example camille anyway the point is the probability of you doing or not doing things would change because you know youre being watched yes
2533882 i was just wondering when your mum gets murdered and you go to the pub is it more normal to roll dice and talk about stalking people or to smash glasses
2533883 excuse me sara can you show us the name on your bank statement please
2533884 well the shock can do it to people i suppose
2533885 its the least we can do for the poor loves
2533886 no no its okay i was just thinking about how long its been since ive spoken to anyone days i think janice is here you know i heard her earlier she knocked on my door
2533887 i dont know i suppose its more that ill expect her to be there and then she isnt than i sit here thinking about the fact shes dead
2533888 i know what you mean i expected her to lose her mind a bit and fade away to die of old age perhaps
2533889 yeah well about how people will die you can usually tell
2533890 i think theres a good chance youll live to be old to die of old age
2533891 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2533892 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2533893 anyway who cares next rounds on me itll be a cheaper one now
2533894 i dont care listen to me row rowan listen rowan be quiet and listen to me a moment it doesnt matter about the window i want to ask you something i want you to do something for me
2533895 i want you never to tell anyone it was you who did the window
2533896 it doesnt matter why rowan im asking you if anyone questions you you say you dont know anything about it you say it was probably the lads who attacked jim do you understand me
2533897 can pretend neo get out to see his pretend friends
2533898 the whole family will be here would you like to join us

2533928 davis said that a tennessee law exists which states that if a person consistently votes in one partys primary elections and then switches to another partys primary that vote can be challenged
2533929 davis added that he is aware of anecdotal evidence that democrats switched over in several counties in thursdays election
2533930 brook thompson state coordinator of elections stated the process is to challenge them at the polls on election day
2533931 an election day challenge would involve poll watchers who based on their own knowledge could challenge someone who has always voted in one partys primary when that person suddenly seeks to vote in the other partys primary
2533932 the state coordinator said the law allows for challenges on election day but not afterward adding i dont know of any election that has been challenged after the fact based on that law

2534027 when youre high up wind gusts are so high your scaffolding trembles and you need to stop the work until its over
2534028 you get used to being up there but some people are cut for this work some are not
2534029 this kind of job can be dangerous but many hispanics take it because the pays good
2534030 but some employers take advantage of undocumented workers and press them to work without proper security measures
2534031 employers are responsible for the well being of the workers providing proper training and a rigorous equipment maintenance

2534036 esta clase de trabajos pueden ser peligrosos pero muchos hispanos los toman porque la paga es buena
2534037 pero hay empleadores que se aprovechan de los trabajadores indocumentados y los presionan para trabajar sin las medidas de seguridad necesarias
2534038 los empleadores son los responsables de asegurar la integridad de sus equipos y de entrenar a sus trabajadores correctamente
2534039 nuestra agencia esta haciendo todo lo posible para prevenir que sucedan accidentes similares en un futuro

2534045 in 2008 pluto planet of transformation deconstruction and reconstruction will move into capricorn sign of established government and moneymaking enterprises to stay till 2024
2534046 it will trigger the american charts cardinal t square from 2009 opposing venus jupiter the sun and squaring saturn through the following seven years
2534047 pluto has not been in capricorn since the 18th century when the american war of independence occurred so the usa is coming full circle in some sense back to where it began
2534048 then in 2011 disruptive uranus moves into aries to pick up the cardinal square to pluto though uranus will have been in orb for three to four years previously
2534049 2014 sees pluto opposing the usa sun until 2016 and uranus in square to it until 2015
2534050 by 2017 it will be time to pick up the pieces and start the process of assembling a new order different governmental and justice systems a reshaped economy

2534055 another extremely violent muhammad cartoon just published i discuss it here
2534056 violence is wrong unless it leads to profit for us
2534057 take it back because im going to kill you whatever you do
2534058 you generalize and condemn all christians as being personally greedy and violent that is a recipe for genocide
2534059 you dont make any such distinctions do you want to kill us all what you say is either from ignorance or hatred which is it
2534060 as it is you come up with at least partial excuses for kids to kill kids and others with suicide bombings that is just sick
2534061 there are martyrs for this love of the messiah all the time what side of the sword have you really been on
2534062 you are so unreasoning so blinded by hatred that you perfectly express what the islamic fundamentalist fellow should be saying in the cartoon
2534063 but having done that why not come home to the catholic church
2534064 or are you afraid of a love that demands that you really love
2534065 and there is none co equal or comparable unto him
2534066 yes i will criticize but not just for the sake of criticism unlike some uae united arab emirates based english blogs
2534067 yet just to say you have some good instincts here shying away from sura 37 100 113 and looking just to the one this shows you are not a muslim not that anyone said you were or that you are perhaps the kind of muslim described by nostra aetate in the second vatican council
2534068 we publish to be read in every christian country and in all the churches of the christian world could become the very best

2534076 december 5 pope gregory xiv succeeds urban vii as the 229th pope
2534077 im pleased to meet you i am father alex menos
2534078 my name is rabbi shelomoh i am likewise pleased to meet you i wasnt sure if i would it looked as if you were dead to the world especially with those wounds on your face
2534079 when living for the lord it is a blessing to be dead to the world
2534080 it is the lord of history the most high who knows the hour of death when we will be blessed to come closer to him
2534081 it was so vivid i could feel the hot breeze the sun was beating down in mid afternoon i was standing in front of an enormous rock i realised that oh im sorry i shouldnt be boring you with my dreams
2534082 i took a semester off from studies in rome to go to hebrew university on mount scopus i also took some special classes at hebrew union college
2534083 im studying the liturgy i couldnt imagine continuing without knowing the jewish liturgy better the latin rite catholic mass is filled with references to the hebrew scriptures
2534084 i saw a very old man and a young boy
2534085 god will provide for himself a lamb for the holocaust my son
2534086 the ambiguous reply of abraham the old man left the boy isaac devastated
2534087 an angel stopped him and showed him a lamb caught in a thicket by its horns which he was to sacrifice instead i know
2534088 that abraham kneels and says i praise you god lord of heaven and earth for instructing us your children that no son of adam is worthy to be sacrificed damaged as he is with adams sin i was ready to obey knowing you would raise isaac from the dead immediately for there would be no other way to raise a progeny from him as you promised thank you for teaching us that you will provide someone who will be a lamb without blemish someone innocent who will take on the sins of all taking on the death we deserve for our sins and so fulfilling justice while having mercy on us someone who will then rise from the dead conquering death bringing us to life thank you for promising us the womans seed
2534089 that seed must be divine in order to avoid being corrupted by adams sin is that what you are telling me
2534090 you say that there is only one revelation that the messiah is jesus the lamb of god who takes away our sins he is the seed born of the virgin miryam
2534091 and you dont think that this is insulting to me
2534092 rabbi i would insult you if i were not to tell you of my love for the messiah
2534093 so you think that catholics are jews who have accepted the messiah
2534094 of course just because someone calls himself a catholic and publicly professes the faith does not mean that he has truly given assent to christ in living faith
2534095 even gentiles of any background if they believe in jesus also believe in the revelation first received by the chosen people for all of revelation must necessarily point to the messiah
2534096 so you would effectively exclude modern day jews from salvation you would exclude me
2534097 the non acceptance of jesus as the messiah to this day makes us look like we want to be guilty of his crucifixion does it not
2534098 instead it is because jews are the children of the promise that i must speak of the fulfilment of the promise to you
2534099 but when i speak it is not because i have anything to offer you myself how can a student teach his master or a younger brother his elder my having anything of the truth has nothing to do with me it is all according to the providence of the most high
2534100 the romans put christ to death but original and personal sin of all jews and gentiles of all times was the real occasion of his death it would not matter when or where christ walked upon the earth his goodness as the messiah would be perceived as being too incriminating for those who did not want to change their ways he would be put to death in any culture among any people we are all guilty of his blood rabbi if i say that you indeed all jews are guilty of the crucifixion of jesus it is not simply so as to accuse you it is because i am thanking the lord for his mercy and goodness in wanting to bring you to himself laying down his life in front of you he has done the same for me i slew him with my sins it is because i am the greatest sinner the greatest enemy of christ inasmuch as he loves me as an individual and yet i have sinned that i feel unworthy to proclaim his mercy to you yet i rejoice as this is the lords good humour
2534101 so you accuse the jews of killing jesus bringing us to auschwitz
2534102 if the lord excluded the sinful jews among all of the sinful peoples of the world in reckoning who was guilty of his blood only the jews would be excluded from the merciful redemption he wrought for us all so yes praise the lord i am accusing
2534103 youve seen right through me through us beside the horrific actions of some weve been condemning catholics all along for the vapid statements of a few individuals through the ages who have accused us of killing christ as if no one else including themselves needed salvation as if no one needed mercy as if no one needed to have the messiah the suffering servant die and rise for them these few arrogant accusers were simply individuals who were hurtful to others including themselves we know that but we wanted to shove such words in the face of the church to see if the church was anti semitic but many in the church have retreated becoming afraid to say that anyone sinned that anyone was in need of redemption everyone is always nice they say that rubbish is all i hear youve given me some hope but at the same time arent you rejecting the claim that mankind is getting better evolving toward a cosmic omega point of niceness
2534104 anyone who speaks of an evolution of niceness as does each marxist kibbutz speaks for satan
2534105 especially after the human sacrifice in the shoah the violence of the twentieth century and now well into the twenty first century with world wide cultures of death they say the resurrection is an ever dying humanity moving through time so why not have more death to speed up the dialectical process
2534106 but what about the loss of identity being encouraged by the impersonal evolving cosmic nirvana presented by modern catholic theological psychobabble
2534107 in reducing everything to an epistemology of phenomenological relativism they set up a violent dialectic by which they pretend everything progresses toward a wholeness of utopia which they do not even want to see arrive they miss out on the fact that wholeness and integrity find immediate fulfilment with graced obedience to god in faith whose sanctifying grace does not flatten ones present personal worth as does dialectical materialism but transforms the person now into the one he is called to become by this grace even though remaining in this world in the just consequences of sin weak and dying but if mankind is not getting any better as is made obvious by people going into denial about violence this fact does not take away our hope it gives us an impetus to look all the more to the messiah our only hope rabbi people talk about springtime but it is winter mankind is worse not better jesus asked if they do this while the wood is green what will happen when it is dry only in recognising this reality can we begin to have true hope in the unity of justice and mercy in the person of the messiah
2534108 there are many without that hope and that is my fear
2534109 there are more judas priests now than ever the church has well over a billion members jews are in danger if there are no catholics who are willing to speak as you do you hold out the mercy of god to us just as you recognise that he has held out mercy to you the catholic church does not deny sin but practically speaking how many go to confession how many priests or bishops offer this mercy inasmuch as you all think of yourselves as having developed into niceness without god that you are doing well enough without his mercy and goodness what is then to become of us jews if there is no sin you can lead us straight to auschwitz and congratulate yourselves as to how nice you are murdering jesus own family
2534110 john the evangelist called jews jews in a derogatory way as the italians do today but jesus tribe of judah is the most blessed to be called a jew is the greatest compliment that i know and your pius xii said as much so tell me why did your evangelist john do that
2534111 he was simply contrasting the universal nature of gods call emphasised by the death and resurrection of the messiah with the way that much of the tribe of judah at that time was collapsing in on itself
2534112 at first i didnt see the face of the boy it had been covered by the wood he was carrying and then by the hand of the old man when the boys throat was about to be slit when the lamb of sacrifice was burning when the flames where filling the skies and reaching to the heavens i saw the face of the lamb it was that of jesus on the cross his face suffering beaten disfigured tortured as i watched the heavens opened and the weight of the glory of the lord was upon us i was kneeling beside abraham and isaac in the presence of the most high the smoke of the offering arose into the heavens like incense when the heavens closed and we stood to our feet they turned to me and clasped my hands in friendship it is then that i saw the face of the boy
2534113 of course it was the face of jesus isaac is the ancestor of jesus it could not be any other way
2534114 that means nothing unless you understand the suffering face of jesus replacing both that of the lamb of sacrifice and isaac to mean that jesus was set to suffer in the place of those who were to be redeemed he would have to be put to death for their sakes to fulfil justice while having mercy on us is that right
2534115 is what you say about the would be child sacrifice of isaac by abraham what islam also believes
2534116 you a catholic are brave enough to tell me a jew about what you believe you think both of us should believe but i want to know what you think about what the quran has to say about child sacrifice and be concise please i am getting tired
2534117 abrahams would be sacrifice of his son as imagined in the quran has nothing to do with an immediate resurrection which only comes at the final judgment moreover there is no stricture in the quran that a progeny of imams would necessarily come through either isaac or ishmael or both in genesis it must be from isaac that the promised progeny comes excluding ishmael necessitating the instantaneous resurrection of isaac instead the quran imagines allah as being a blood thirsty god who is pleased with child sacrifice as the best method of bribing ones way into his favour it is the essential text used to encourage child sacrifice terrorist bombings it is the central text of islam the quranic version of abrahams would be sacrifice of his son has nothing to do with the account in genesis the true abraham is not the father in faith of islam promoting quranic style child sacrifice is not true religion
2534118 im sure brussels will have something to say about such a diatribe in view of their new law about
2534119 if this critique is offensive to the non emotive language police in brussels it is not because they are ignorant but because they know the truth is being told a truth they want to hide as they encourage the islamicisation of europe africa asia the world they complain that academic critiques like this risk the radicalisation of muslims their words not mine they are cynically aware that it is they who are saying that the roots of islam are terroristic for this is what the word radical means it is those who forbid the truth to be told who are true terrorists they create the conditions in which terrorist bombings will continue they are afraid to permit a reasoned critique of islam a fear which bodes the end of society as we know it
2534120 of course almost no muslims have any idea about the significance of the story as recounted in the quran they think it simply means that they are to submit to allah no matter what not realizing that there is a difference between doing something against reason which would be the qurans account of abrahams sacrifice on the one hand and on the other hand doing something which is not unreasonable such as abrahams sacrifice recounted in genesis muslims are simply victims of muhammad a judaeo christian heretic who advanced his own brand of pelagianism of working his own way to heaven which always involves bribery and violence we must be thankful that muslims have not been deeply infected with muhammads thought most just go through the motions trying to be religious despite the perversion of true religion that muhammad shoved down their throats
2534121 so youre saying that it is not our generosity which gains acceptance by god but our faith which is not so much ours but is gods gift to us
2534122 i was near the same rock of sacrifice but with different mountains in the background
2534123 they were sure that they could keep the law of the lord under their own power they ignored the symbolism of the blood of the sacrifice being thrown on the altar and then upon themselves they loudly proclaimed they could should and surely would do and obey all that the lord had spoken they refused to be reminded by that blood that they themselves should have been put to death for their sin and that they should by grace come before the lord with the humble and contrite heart that he was providing for them they did not look forward on account of that animal blood to the messiah their suffering servant to the redeemers blood which would be thrown on them and on their children they suppressed the truth that he alone could fulfil the justice needed for this ever present mercy the mercy of himself being sacrificed for us
2534124 they should have known that they could not keep the law of the lord without his grace they ought to have said by the grace of god all that the lord has spoken we will do and obey i know all that better than you but many take the cry his blood be upon us and upon our children which we jews screamed during pontius pilots condemnation of jesus and hold it against us
2534125 in my dream all the people had the same face as i watched the blood being thrown upon them the face of the suffering servant who hates the sinner and his sin so that with their repentance he will take them to himself on eagles wings forgiving them transforming them
2534126 next in my dream i saw moses raising the tablets of the law above his head looking down in disgust at the people
2534127 they were worshipping a golden bull in my dream moses threw down the tablets of the law shattering them on the precipice upon which he stood the pieces scattered and broke into ever smaller pieces as they tumbled down the mountain but then these stones grew into the size of the human heart and violently slammed into the chest of each person there from the youngest to the oldest to my horror they did not even notice they had hearts of stone but then they looked up at moses i froze when i saw their eyes it looked like they had no conscience
2534128 the only thing that can be done for someone without a conscience is to shove their faces in their sin even while and because of holding out forgiveness to them and goodness and kindness it is most merciful the lord made them sacrifice the very animals they were worshipping incorrect following of the rubrics could mean the death penalty but as all the prophets have noted they were still not getting the right idea which would have been to look forward to a redeeming messiah with a humble and contrite heart they immediately became proud of their sacrifices as if the very action of the sacrifice would make them worthy to be in gods presence as if they were bribing god by way of their goodness and generosity but only had violence and arrogance to offer now i hope your dream is going somewhere
2534129 the rock of sacrifice then accompanied the chosen people to the promised land
2534130 god was teaching us all about the serious nature of sin
2534131 and that redemption was necessary this was a pedagogical action both for the chosen people and for all nations on earth the chosen people carried the revelation of the most high no one should have had the audacity to be their enemies anyone who did so deserved death
2534132 but what of the little ones the babies surely they were not our enemies how could we slaughter them and why not just go around jericho ignoring it
2534133 the little ones are as much a part of fallen mankind as you or i rabbi and are not exempt from gods justice it was just a matter of sooner rather than later that they died of the just effects of adams sin which corrupted us the children of his corporate person but the lord provides or permits what it takes to get the knowledge across to us that we belong to him including sickness violence or old age in jericho the violence prepared both jew and gentile for the coming of the suffering servant teaching all involved including us how serious is the justice that makes gods grant of mercy the fulfilment of righteousness we know little of what it means that jesus god died and rose for us this truth is too crushing for us the way jericho suffered is nothing compared to what we need to learn about the overwhelming weight of the messiahs sacrifice
2534134 if the sacrifice of human beings at jericho has pedagogical force helping us to keep the full weight of the meaning of the other sacrifices before us is it not true that jews who do not accept that the messiah has come have the right in their own minds to continue this divine pedagogy by slaughtering all of the palestinians as if they were all from jericho a kind of divine mandate shall we say to prepare for the messiah a kind of lesson about gods justice
2534135 in my dream all the people had the same face as i watched the blood being thrown upon them the face of the suffering servant
2534136 0274 reader locations doonside australia where readers read this jackass trilogy of novels on all the murderous intrigue of interreligious politics between jews catholics and muslims and others join the family
2534137 i call upon the catholic community of the archiocese of adelaide to take seriously the churchs call to come to know understand and love their muslim brothers and sisters and to support and deveop further dialogue
2534138 our common future is at stake the very future of the world itself is perhaps at stake
2534139 so let us build on that and strengthen that mutual respect
2534140 only transparent straightforward and guaranteed way of preserving our full range of much needed services for some of the most vulnerable children in the country
2534141 i suspect if a same sex couple arrives at any of the agencies just to test out the system they will not get very far
2534142 we do not know whether we will actually be asked to consider same sex couples for the placing of children because statistically very few same sex couples go for adoption anyway
2534143 we have to give an interview to same sex couples asking to be considered for adoption no you dont be martyrs stop sacrificing children for your own self congratulations about how nice you think you all are but we are not anticipating we are going to get lots of same sex couples is that the stench of cynicism i smell it is much more likely that they will go to their local authority because it is the local authority which makes decisions about matching children with approved adopters not the society
2534144 we need to make it very clear that the assessment of any adopters is very thorough not when you think that homosexual couples are appropriate youve just said that your asessment is from hell poor children it is not about finding children for adults but it is about finding families for very difficult children
2534145 there are bishops who are taking the legal route about this but ours are not i repeat is it that they absolutely hate children with all their hearts souls and minds it remains to be seen whether that would result in more difficulties for their agencies
2534146 the jackass trilogy fisks the catholic news agencys reporting that the largest catholic adoption agency in england and wales has decided to implement an adoption policy that does not rule out same sex couples
2534147 you know that priest was acting against the faith by taking the positon he did
2534148 we can accept a little poison for the amount of good that we do
2534149 we would not be happy to be quoted as such
2534150 oh well there is more to learn best get on with it
2534151 teaching approaches that are focused only on formal concepts and symbol use can be frustrating and readily forgotten very often learners can make no sense of such abstractions that is such notions may remain meaningless and mechanical because they appear to have nothing to do with the knowers organic bodily sensations

2534196 life must become positive in reactions man is not his best friend he is seeking outside for something to quiet his nature he is carrying his reactions with him keeping old habit patterns going for a person to renovate his subconscious mind he must be willing to move out for awhile redesign rebuild redecorate then move back in this is a form of spiritual discipline overlapping reactions are dangerous living in overlapping reactions and understanding nothing of how to get along without them because of no discrimination makes man give up overcoming reaction is easy you can wipe it out of your life and realize the benefit of having done so sit down and think look at your life look at the tendencies within your nature which created your habit patterns and which formed your subconscious mind and gave it the foundation for many more of the same old situations the tendencies will be greater in each succeeding situation unless you apply the brakes of understanding if you sit down and realize the law of cause and effect and live according to the basic laws of life you will overcome the reactions within you you will be able to overcome old reactions by understanding them more realization will burst forth from within you and you will live a more spiritual life you can either walk through a city full of fog or climb above it thinking and believing clearly are only possible when a man knows that he knows when you realize something you only know of your realization after you have realized it not before realization is your teacher realize something every day or something will block the subconscious mind the reactionary nature must subside its death gives birth to a greater understanding if you can live for three weeks without reacting to anything you will attain a realization if you simply remember this without practicing it you will not be helping yourself or anyone else but if you take the law and put it into practice you will be doing something for yourself and your fellow man because you will realize a greater spiritual power a greater humility and be the person you should be then dont react again discriminate as to each move you make each word you say and decide whether there will be a reaction if you can see ahead that you will not react proceed dictate to yourself face yourself face your mistakes and dont make them again breaking spiritual laws creates reactions in the subconscious and man loses spiritual power we can find actual peace of mind in a certain place right here and now within ourselves when we overcome reactions let us look within and see if we are reacting to anything right now holding any resentment holding any fear let us know that that is just a gauge of experience of the instinctive nature loosen it and let it go mentally look ahead to the future and know that everything we do and say will have a reaction let us give birth to good positive controlled reactions and be sure that if they overlap they are transparent that they create a light growing brighter overlapping negative reactions bring darkness depression and make man nervous we have been delving into our consciousness if you have understood all this about your reactions your subconscious mind has been impressed look into your mirror your reflection is your subconscious mind objectified find out what is holding you back face yourself and find out what is keeping you from expressing the great things which are within you here and now after all life is meant to be lived joyously
2534197 wake up america claims of the first black president being obama are wrong here is a little history for ya john henson president 1742 heres a little blurb and a reference page feel free to check up on our history
2534198 for the most part it is a ridiculously blatant distortion of history
2534199 i am alexander wilson founder of the investigations unit ph 1 813 398 2790 although there are those that do not believe what is before them and available to them on the library of congress website and would have you believe that john hanson was a swedish gentleman the library of congress will inform you otherwise he was a moor you may visit his portrait letters to general washington prior to george washington becoming a u s president and letters to the french on www loc gov in life we have options to believe disbelieve or investigate ive personally chose the latter thereof in regards to john hanson throughout my quest for political awareness that far surpasses the limited knowledge to which the media and government agencies afford me ive found astonishing information my source for these discoveries begin with the library of congress www loc gov
2534200 all these queries will be resolved within the confines of these pages but first allow me to address the obvious the moor this black gentleman referring to the picture is actually john hanson of maryland the portrait was painted of him in honor of his newly appointed office as president of the united states of america under the articles of confederation the photo was taken directly from the library of congress website at loc gov
2534201 after the discovery of a black man being the first president of the united states the reporter in his haste to put a picture with the name used the wrong picture he was unaware that the process used to make that picture was not invented until the mid 1800s and it had a name of john hanson senator of liberia on the back

2534236 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2534237 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2534241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2534242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2534243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2534244 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2534245 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2534246 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2534278 its ridiculous i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2534279 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture
2534280 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice
2534281 it is not just that there were issues with historical accuracy this was quite deliberately provocative she objectified the wife of the prophet as a sex object and made her violent as well
2534282 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking 12 wives and concubines in all
2534283 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
2534284 denise says it is a declaration of war a national security issue

2534287 its not funny like haha its funny like i told you so
2534288 thats more than a dress its a grace kelly movie
2534289 we have a lot of expectations and aspirations for this new school year

2534354 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set when we did oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch everyday and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different that any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore

2534356 require manufacturers and importers to subject toys and other nursery products to strict safety tests before they hit store shelves
2534357 the legislation would phase in a near ban on lead in products designed for children 12 and younger and create an easily searchable database of consumer complaints about a products safety the law would set an allowable lead standard of 600 parts per million within 180 days 300 ppm after one year and 100 ppm after three years the precise amount of lead that can cause harm in a child remains a matter of debate the u s consumer product safety commission would review the limit and could lower it still further

2534367 there is no reason or need to give up on dialogue at this point
2534368 active and positive attitude to prevent the loss of human lives
2534369 we will hold on to any small hope to save them
2534370 we cannot say were relieved but there is no other way but to believe their words that theyre going to do their best
2534371 we cannot exceed our penguin citizens limit and accept people without proof of identity at such a time the lawless could hide under rpf uniform
2534372 i think we should have voted for a more responsible and planning ahead governor
2534373 right now no one is leaving the safe places that is definetely for sure
2534374 i hardly see how the watex warriors were defending tundra at this point
2534375 tundra is basically dead and local citizens have fled to other servers tundra is becoming big
2534376 it was amazing that he was walking on his own losing as much blood as fast as he was
2534377 he was in some kind of bandage holding his arm up against his chest and then he had it all wrapped up
2534378 he was in pretty rough shape but he communicated with us all the way to the hospital hes obviously one tough guy i think he ought to be the next superman
2534379 ive never seen anybody who has the will to live and is as much of a warrior as aron is and ive been doing this for 25 years
2534380 sometimes we get pretty scared with some of the things hes doing
2534381 life is empty and meaningless it is in the emptiness that we create possibilities for extraordinary results
2534382 i think we proved today to all the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2534383 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2534384 we accomplished our first set of goals to go out and be consistent and to qualify for team finals we will go through our usual process and review our performances in the prelims and the coaches will meet to determine our line up for the 6 3 3 format in the finals

2534386 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2534387 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2534388 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2534389 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2534390 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society
2534391 all indications show the 2008 election will probably have the largest youth voter turnout the largest hip hop voter turnout in u s history
2534392 they built tommy hilfiger from scratch and they reaffirmed versace theres no reason why they cant help to build obamas brand like they do for coke or pepsi
2534393 teachers shall report all suspected cases of child abuse or neglect to the school principal who shall then notify the division of protective services county department of social services of the suspected abuse or neglect
2534394 personnel investigations are confidential and central office staff principals or teachers should not discuss personnel matters under investigation with those not a part of the investigation including the press any further failure to adhere to these requirements could lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination
2534395 other co workers had already gone to him with reports and nothing was done
2534396 i was aware that going to cuffee wouldnt have made much of a difference
2534397 i was just fed up and i went into his office to vent about the situation
2534398 he looked at me and said dont think i dont know what goes on down there
2534399 there was an atmosphere of secrecy it was something no one was supposed to speak about
2534400 my concern was that this woman had hurt children and they were sweeping it under the rug
2534401 i was accused of not following the chain of command
2534402 i think that she should be commended for putting the childrens welfare first
2534403 i acted out of frustration driven by my outrage that nobody was going to be held accountable for what these students had endured
2534404 i could not understand why the matter was not directly addressed in a manner where everybodys rights were respected
2534405 the question in this case is did this type of whistle blowing qualify as a matter of public concern and if it does does the publics interest in having the matter reported outweigh the disruption caused in the school
2534406 i cant say that theres anything in our policy that says someone cant talk to the press
2534407 but the expectation when dealing with personnel matters is that they talk to the principal first
2534408 i know that a common struggle for teachers in a highly competitive system such as henrico county public schools is how they respond to anything controversial
2534409 in subtle ways we are directed to follow an unspoken guideline that states nothing bad ever happens in henrico county
2534410 i wish it was that other chicago team that called him up
2534411 people were cheering screaming yelling when he hit 99 mph they all went nuts
2534412 he missed having that set schedule every saturday he would go off for games
2534413 he was always in a nice rhythm getting ready for something it has kind of been a year year and a half where hes kind of been in a little lull
2534414 i knew without a doubt he could step on the field and play immediately
2534415 in baseball he was good but rough around the edges he still had a lot of developing to do
2534416 the analysts would always say it might take him 4 5 6 7 years and he still might not make it i got worried about that
2534417 thats the hard part everyone is watching him and hes got to throw every pitch
2534418 at least in football youve got guys helping you even when he was one on one all he had to do was catch the ball but now not only is he the one throwing the ball hes got to throw it with movement hit his spots and it seems like the umpires make you throw it right down the middle
2534419 besides girls assure that it the old and devoted admirers spice girls and to leave on one stage with their participant would be for them honour
2534420 well we have for the first time ever written more songs than we need for an album everything isnt 100 finished but everything is moving along great no release date yet

2534422 unfortunately after the gig at york nick tart vocals came down with laryngitis
2534423 nick is totally gutted about this and the the band were all looking forward to these dates hopefully nick will have made a full recovery in time for the london and bilston shows later this month
2534424 i actually want the country to see who i am who i really am
2534425 in my experience this is one big problem with older guys they start to lose their spontaneity in their thirties start saying what they think theyre supposed to say instead of what they feel sort of like hardening of the arteries like were all pretty much raving maniacs as kids but then some of us get all conventional not me thats why i know im going to be a great actress some day im totally in touch with my child
2534426 i believe i was hired because i was not interested in politics from my perspective it was just a gross environment the whole experience was life altering for me
2534427 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood

2534433 so far it has largely been an incident free day and that is largely due to the work done by police and the organisers local community groups and of course the business forum here in the town
2534434 so were very pleased and i would thank everyone concerned for their efforts so far
2534435 its very much in our minds that the whole community benefits from this
2534436 families have had to live with a barrage of stones bottles and petrol bomb attacks
2534437 for these families justice is as far away as ever we in republican sinn f in call on nationalists to remain vigilant
2534438 crj have been granted funding for schemes in belfast and derry city due to their willingness to collaborate openly with the ruc and other agents of english rule in our country
2534439 whilst republicans have long been aware of these nefarious activities carried out by that organisation crj are now anxious to admit to this publicly these british backed schemes have nothing to offer nationalists and republicans and should disband
2534440 vans belonging to this corporation are currently travelling around ireland and indeed around the world photographing everything they pass every street and indeed everyones home will then be accessible to view on the internet
2534441 such images being freely available around the world creates a very real risk to the security of individuals malicious viewers could use such data to establish weaknesses in peoples personal security and identify opportunities to attack their enemies needless to say google has not sought the permission of anyone to photograph them or their properties and must be made to destroy this material
2534442 such identity cards have already been mooted by the british with the intention of making them compulsory
2534443 identity cards do nothing to improve security and merely increase the intrusion by the state into peoples daily lives and aid the development of a surveillance society any attempt to introduce a state identity card must be resisted
2534444 rt previously suspended medium wave radio services which would have left a significant number of people within the six counties without access to their radio programmes
2534445 only after a sustained media campaign did rt provide a new fm frequency for radio 1 in the north east of the country
2534446 once again they are seeking to exclude irish citizens and indeed irish residents through their proposals both to suspend analogue broadcasts and broadcast digitally exclusively within the 26 counties these actions give the lie to their claim to be the national broadcaster
2534447 special branch was initially established as the special irish branch of the london metropolitan police and the british military intelligence agency mi5 was founded by kerryman william melville
2534448 these agencies are responsible for the incarceration and murders of countless irish citizens indeed many of them within their own shores mi5s presence in holywood clearly has little to do with monitoring islamist activity and is merely a convenient outpost to spy upon the irish people whilst this may have been welcomed by the provos true republicans will do all in their power to ensure that all british activity against irish citizens and on irish soil is ended permanently
2534449 so northern ireland needs a strong and coherent opposition we are providing that opposition and we will continue to do so
2534450 football has to be the winner and thats what its all about
2534451 connections to both 9provisional sinn f in and the provisional ira
2534452 we dont in any way see this as the end of the game we see this as the opening of another avenue of the investigation
2534453 the fact that mr rupert may or may not have had a shady background and the fact that as a paid agent he might be suspect as a witness at any rate are neither here nor there
2534454 in opposition to criminal and antisocial elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
2534455 this is the first time our banner has been displayed at pride in belfast because it was important to increase our visibility and to show people that there are alternative christian views than those espoused by iris robinson
2534456 this is not about removing anything from the classroom although that would probably be the ideal for me but this is about us having equality of access to other views as to how the world came into existence and that i think is a very very important issue for many parents in northern ireland
2534457 the evidence based approach to scientific theories and knowledge in science lessons and exploring other beliefs about how the world came into existence
2534458 the problem to date has been that we only have a narrow interpretation from an evolutionary point of view as to how these particular stones were formed
2534459 it is the duty of government to uphold gods law
2534460 i was sore and in a sorry state when i arrived here
2534461 mr brennans continued detention without bond appears to serve no end that is consistent with the interest of the united states to foster a lasting peace in northern ireland
2534462 with his marriage to a united states citizen and provisions in the law to waive his prior unlawful presence in the u s mr brennan ought to be granted the opportunity to contest the charge of removal with the privilege of release on bond his continued detention is not justified for the security of the united states or its people nor is he a flight risk
2534463 yes i do my understanding is the only problem with that is that he didnt file the work permit renewal form on time
2534464 as i understand it he was living here legally and then there was a paperwork error and whether it was his fault or the governments fault the fact is as i understand it there was no malice there was no attempt not to file it so if they are the facts then he should stay
2534465 i was seeing him every saturday for either a half hour or an hour
2534466 now that is no longer possible the new prison is in the middle of nowhere it would be a two day drive each way for me to see him
2534467 there would not be any point in bringing us back on the basis of where we finished on the last day something would have to change the question of whether an invitation issues is a moot point at this stage there is nothing that has created an environment where an invitation would be positively looked at this stage
2534468 workers expect us to lodge claims inflation has not stopped price rises have not stopped
2534469 if they had made substantial proposals in those areas it would have coloured the thinking of unions on the pay side
2534470 at the end of the day responsibility will rest with the members they will make the final decisions
2534471 the only realistic forecast is that for 2008 as a whole the consumer price index will average 5 per cent
2534472 my father calls people like graham the forgotten people he was vomiting all the time and he was eventually put on a trolley but someone like graham cant stay on a trolley for long because of the scoliosis in his back
2534473 graham cant go up to the bathroom so he wears nappies all the time the staff just left him in the wet nappy his nappy was soaking and we wanted a bed so we could change him in privacy
2534474 we didnt want a private room or an en suite just somewhere where we could change his nappy without other patients around us
2534475 cuh regrets that the family was unhappy with the treatment they received every effort is made to ensure that patients are treated with the dignity and courtesy they are entitled to
2534476 the patient was discharged from hospital on saturday morning and hospital staff are available to directly liaise with the family to address their concerns
2534477 we really appreciate it the organising committee approached us a few months ago and it took off very quickly we are thrilled
2534478 people have been thinking about something like this for years but nobody took the initiative of actually doing anything until less than a year ago
2534479 we picked this weekend because it would have been his riadas birthday and members of ceolt iri cualann always come to the town at this time
2534480 the cynical attempt to rope businesses into supporting hunting im surprised that the ifa is lending their support to this i would have thought there were far more important issues facing irish farming
2534481 the worst is still to come after the olympics when attention of world moves away from china
2534482 we fear the worst might happen to those in prisons and they might be given the death penalty
2534483 we are urging all governments around the world to press china to release all these prisoners
2534484 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months

2534507 readers question the use of a quote in a story about obamas presumptuousness
2534508 theres no tape to verify the obama camps version of the quote either and post editors refused to publish a correction
2534509 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2534510 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way

2534515 little is more representative of a churchs theology than its architecture and this building is not us
2534516 the church has sought to demolish the araldo cossutta designed chapel since 1991 making way for a smaller and more energy efficient building
2534517 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2534518 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2534519 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
2534520 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
2534521 yea it is easier for the camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
2534522 yea it is easier for a philandering husband in politics to find public forgiveness than it is for a party switcher to ever receive mercy much less redemption

2534524 a feature story in this weeks sunday new york times magazine asks is obama the end of black politics this in the wake of a full week of tv talking heads asking if obama played the race card in his response to john mccains obama celebrity ads and an opinion piece in the wall street journal by black journalist juan williams saying that the race issue isnt going away mr williams is right the race issue isnt going away and the new york times feature which profiles new young black politicians around the nation like massachusetts gov deval patrick newark mayor corey booker and philadelphia mayor michael nutter sheds little light on the issue in what it says more revealing about the times piece is what it doesnt say the times reporter never found it relevant to note that every black politician he spoke to is a democrat nor did he see a need to talk to a single black conservative its not like black conservatives have nothing to say here hoover institute scholar shelby steele wrote a book about obama tom sowell has regularly written about him as have i but black conservatives are not considered relevant to these discussions because race is not an issue of ethnicity but an issue of politics black politics means liberal politics and hence black conservatives are not black
2534525 almost a third of blacks surveyed in a recent wall street journal poll responded that race is the most important or one of the most important considerations in their vote but practically speaking it makes no difference despite black excitement and pride in the obama candidacy the black vote would go for whomever headed the democratic ticket white or black in 2004 john kerry got 88 percent of the black vote the dynamics the obama candidacy has interjected is new only in form not in content in the past the liberal at the top of the heap for whom blacks overwhelmingly voted was white now that liberal is black thats new barack obama as shelby steele has written departs from the jesse jackon al sharpton brand of politics in that he is far more sophisticated and subtle in how to play on white guilt and how to intimidate thats new but the liberal content and agenda is not new and this blacks continue to buy en masse
2534526 the points conservatives have been hammering for the last 20 years have not been for naught there is increasing awareness among blacks how family breakdown is driving the social problems of the community this is not lost on obama his speeches paying credence to the importance and relevance of personal responsibility are well received among blacks but also play well to the whites he wishes to reach but the program behind the words remains comfortably lodged on the far left big government answers for everything redistribution of wealth use of law as a tool for politics liberal abortion policies and legitimization of the homosexual agenda the relevant question is not if obama means the end of black politics the issue is will black politics black uniform support for liberals ever change

2534532 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2534533 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2534534 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2534535 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2534536 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2534537 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2534538 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it

2534547 a description of syntactic structure prescriptions of how to use structures and words rhetorically effective use of syntactic structures and the functional command of sentence structure that enables us to comprehend and produce language
2534548 syntax is how different kinds of words in a language combine into grammatical structures and usage is not about how words fit together but how they communicate meaning
2534549 the teaching of formal grammar has a negligible or because it usually displaces some instruction and practice in composition even harmful effect on the improvement of writing
2534550 the use of isolated grammar and usage exercises not supported by theory and research is a deterrent to the improvement of students speaking and writing
2534551 some individuals simply do not analyze complexities of language very well and do not function well under this type of learning approach to then have these individuals try to analyze words sentences and parts of speech is very difficult if not detrimental to their learning process
2534552 the study of grammar has come to have strictly negative remedial associations a band aid for weak and inexperienced writers rather than a rhetorical tool that all writers should understand and control
2534553 it had become a sterile set of exercises removed from any real world context of language use
2534554 w e have traditionally taught grammar to students without appreciating the fact that they already have a full grammar system an ability to organize language meaningfully in their heads consequently the grammar of the classroom has often seemed to students like so much unnecessary jargon they have to learn about a language they already know or if students are dialect speakers for whom mainstream english is puzzling and strange traditional grammar with all its rules and exceptions is not much help
2534555 you are really spending time on grammar when you discuss cohesion and transition when you explain in a conference why a structure is misplaced or awkward when you help students understand the effects of certain words on the reader when you point out redundancy when you suggest sentence revision when you praise gems of precision
2534556 all native speakers of a language have more grammar in their heads than any grammar book will ever contain our job as teachers is to help our students discover this knowledge
2534557 writers who recognize the choices grammar makes available to them will be well equipped for controlling the effects of their words
2534558 research shows that learning grammar is best done in the context of reading writing and speaking
2534559 teachers need to step outside the confines of the course book in order to provide real communicative opportunities for learners the best classroom activities are those that incorporate elements of real life language
2534560 a grammar that enables the teacher to turn linguistic features of the language into tools to improve the competence of student writers
2534561 discarding most of the technical jargon and focusing primarily on writers choices in conveying meaning is a great way to help students feel comfortable with grammar lessons
2534562 step one choose several grammatical constructions to teach the students step two introduce each grammatical structure by giving students short exercises that relate to them and their surroundings step three use their new awareness of grammar to edit their own work
2534563 its during the editing phase of the writing process that grammar and correctness issues get more attention its at that point that we have a responsibility to teach enough grammar and usage to enable student writers to manipulate the language and the meaning of their own sentences and texts
2534564 within the conference context the writer and teacher can focus with precision on such issues as how to use a specific grammatical concept or how to correct a particular surface feature error all based entirely on what a particular student needs to know or is ready to learn for a real purpose these micro lessons are little one to five minute exercises that occur in one on one conversations and they address issues that are common in that individuals writing
2534565 one conference isnt enough but conference micro lessons add grammatical and surface feature skills that help students become more confident as writers
2534566 as students use what they learn in editing mini lessons in their own writing they can conduct peer editing conferences with each other noticing errors and discussing possible corrections
2534567 knowing about grammar is important for numerous reasons its the language that lets us talk about language it names the type of words and word groups that comprise sentences in english and other languages it helps with understanding what makes sentences and paragraphs clear interesting and precise it can be part of literature discussions as we examine the sentences in poetry and stories it lets us understand that all languages and all dialects follow grammatical patterns ncte
2534568 a s teachers we continually need to redefine our role within the classroom which can only be achieved by experimenting with different methods of teaching i am not sure that there is or ever will be a single best teaching method for the simple reason that there are many types of learners with differing learning preferences what i do believe however is that every teaching model or approach has something to offer what is most important is that teachers seek to rewrite themselves again and again for it is in rewriting yourself that you find you have something new to say something that you can say with enthusiasm and conviction and if the teacher is enthusiastic and motivated it is likely that the students will be too

2534582 police officers have a responsibility to ensure that motorists are following the correct speed when using our roads we plead with the people who man the website to refrain from encouraging such lawlessness among motorists
2534583 we want to foster a good relationship between the police and motorists these suggestions are going to cause problems and may endanger the police officer and motorist
2534584 these officers hiding behind bushes and bridges need to be taught a lesson
2534585 about two months ago i was travelling towards musgrave road and noticed a police officer manning this speed camera his back was faced towards the traffic
2534586 i thought about how upset i was when i received fines which were so unnecessary i actually felt pity for those motorists who were going to receive an unpleasant gift in the post i knew full well that i had no rear number plate because of an accident two weeks before
2534587 as i drove past the police officer i grabbed my empty glass juice bottle and aimed it at him i heard a thud and as i sped off and looked in my rear view mirror i noticed he was hit in the back it was quite a good shot even though i aimed for the head
2534588 if they want to be so devious then we can play that game as well motorists must always keep empty bottles and cooldrink cans on hand to throw at these officers sometimes its wise to let the passenger do it for you but always be careful and try to conceal your number plates if possible
2534589 to all you taggers graffiti artists and paint can hobos out there
2534590 why dont you put your anti social behaviour to good use and paint over the lenses of a few static traffic cameras while youre about it also make the poles and boxes a bit more visible
2534591 we have said this before and we will say it again even serious things have a lighter side to them we are sorry if the cops have such a deficient sense of humour
2534592 people have a right to know where speed cameras are to be located just like they have a right to air their grievances about sneaky police officers
2534593 the international thinking is that trapping by stealth is purely for revenue collection purposes not for road safety
2534594 have you ever disliked something about the school or really liked something
2534595 what gives us reason to write letters to who do we write them requests thanks and complaints are the three answers you are looking for who needs to write these letters what do you see yourself using letter writing for in the future near or far
2534596 what do you like about the school or what changes would you like to see in the school why try to come up with five likes or dislikes about this school
2534597 writing is a powerful tool for influencing others getting what you want and problem solving in order to write in ways that meet their needs children must think about how to get their readers attention and be persuasive and clear learning to write persuasively is a valuable life long skill in addition children need to write for real purposes and audiences if they are to learn that writing is personally meaningful and a powerful communication tool

2534599 i cant ever remember this many balls being dropped at a training camp down here
2534600 right now were searching for those guys nobody has stepped up too many mental errors too many technique errors
2534601 it was an eye opener for me especially coming from atlanta watching those guys trying to throw and catch the ball compared to watching these guys throw and catch the ball is like night and day its not even close
2534602 it hasnt changed anything to me its just opened up the opportunity for the tight ends to get more passes down the field

2534604 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2534605 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2534606 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2534607 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
2534608 suddenly there was no work because they only give jobs to spaniards i wanted to work in mallorca but i got stranded here

2534611 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
2534612 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
2534613 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
2534614 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
2534615 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
2534616 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
2534617 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
2534618 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we wont stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
2534619 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down

2534631 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2534632 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2534633 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2534634 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2534635 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2534636 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2534637 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2534638 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2534639 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2534640 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
2534641 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2534642 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

2534690 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2534691 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2534692 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2534693 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2534720 for he apollos mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ
2534721 but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision
2534722 and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism
2534723 something caused paul to inquire further about the salvation of these twelve for he knew that all believers in christ from pentecost to the rapture are now indwelt with the holy spirit
2534724 when ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
2534725 unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism
2534726 then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should future tense believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus
2534727 that is do not be as the scribes and pharisees and hypocrites who mock at jesus claim to be the messiah but
2534728 paul proclaimed to these men as he did everywhere that jesus was the christ on the cross that did come acts 16 31 17 3 18 5
2534729 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
2534730 and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues
2534731 the same as they in acts 19 6 we are going to see that gods
2534732 believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very
2534733 paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god
2534734 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god
2534735 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth
2534736 paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ
2534737 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus
2534738 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour
2534739 when these at ephesus heard pauls new message and believed he laid his hands upon them and they received the holy spirit and spoke in tongues languages
2534740 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness
2534741 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
2534742 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see age 35
2534743 this is he who came by water and blood jesus christ not by the water only but by the water and the blood
2534744 john tells us in his gospel about an eyewitness himself obviously who stood under jesus cross when one of the soldiers pierced the side of the dead savior this witness saw blood and water come from the wound john saw a sign in this something that had a deeper meaning a stream of life came from the dead savior on the cross that would reach the whole world that stream would come with water in baptism and blood in the communion cup it would carry with it jesus victory on the cross in his letter he writes about this sight we can regard these words as a very useful reminder that christ has come to us with water in baptism however he has also come with blood a christian is not only baptized but a guest at communion you cant take communion once as with baptism and then in belief go about your life communion is something to be taken regularly through baptism weve been incorporated into christ as members in his body now the stream of life from him pulsates through us also through communion this stream reaches us as the blood that cleanses us from all sin in communion we drink from the source of life and forgiveness we are at the cross and the gates of heaven at the same time that open slightly and let us hear the never ending exultations surrounding the lamb of god and catch a glimpse of his glory

2534761 your question cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions
2534762 its a very sad moment for everyone wearing red white and blue
2534763 just sad they kind of informed us that it was an isolated event but whenever something that tragic happens your initial feeling is to want to be a little bit more secure wherever you go
2534764 they told us it was totally random and doesnt have anything to do with the olympics or america
2534765 they said there isnt a lot of crime in beijing and its rare for something like this to happen we hope thats true its so sad that it happened and we feel awful for the family
2534766 if anything happens to any one of us then were all touched by it were definitely going to be a lot more conscious of being safe
2534767 feel any less safe because of this i felt very safe im going to continue to feel very safe in china

2534771 they did not voice any concerns to me doesnt mean they dont have them
2534772 we have not yet been given where to go and where not to go

2534776 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
2534777 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
2534778 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
2534779 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike

2534852 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2534853 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2534854 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2534855 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2534856 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2534857 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legal document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2534858 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a requirement because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2534859 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2534878 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate
2534879 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal interfax news agency reported putin flew from beijing where he attended the opening of the olympic games to north ossetia in russia to discuss the influx of tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing from across the border after two days of fighting between georgian troops separatists and russian forces
2534880 this evening a delegation of us eu osce and nato officials will be going to georgia to try to broker a ceasefire
2534881 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2534882 the russian president has specifically stressed that the only way out from the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone

2534923 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2534924 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2534925 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2534926 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2534927 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2534928 the internet is an ogre finding art in the software architecture
2534929 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2534930 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2534931 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2534932 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2534933 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2534934 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2534935 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2534936 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2534937 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2534938 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2534939 open invention network and its role in open source and linux
2534940 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2534941 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2534942 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2534943 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2534944 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2534945 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2534946 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2534947 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2534948 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2534949 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2534950 it is with this in mind that the on going dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2534951 nato remains very concerned there is no doubt about that
2534952 the negotiations that we nato and others are calling for can only be based on georgias territorial integrity
2534953 the nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer continues to believe that all sides involved must immediately cease military operations and start negotiating
2534954 they are safe and sound though the gentleman is weak and tired he might go to hospital directly
2534955 the hostages were released through negotiations and there was no ransom paid
2534956 we succeeded in gaining the release of the german hostages late last night after discussing with the kidnappers they are now free
2534957 everything is ok now they are safe puntland ministers are controlling the matter
2534958 are not in good shape because of the difficult situation they lived during the time they were in the hands of the kidnappers they did not treat them well
2534959 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2534960 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2534961 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2534962 landslides have hit many areas but flash floods have caused the largest number of deaths
2534963 at least 800 houses have been destroyed or damaged we are still trying to get in touch with local authorities to help the people there rescue efforts are ongoing but they are being slowed by the severe weather
2534964 we were ready to leave today we are ready to leave immediately but we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi
2534965 we are discussing with the americans the conditions of our departure which may take place tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2534966 well face structural changes so well have to make changes fortunately they are in a stable area of iraq
2534967 they are setting up checkpoints with the border with iran and controlling entry and exit
2534968 their departure will not cause a vacuum or have any effect because wasit province is stable and iraqi forces were about to take over security of the province
2534969 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
2534970 crushing blow not to see his name in the list but badri was not ready to miss training but he looked drained out
2534971 for the first time in my life im feeling that im training out of duty
2534972 forget emerging nations trophy i have scored heavily during the a series against australia and south africa earlier and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competitions is gautam gambhir the india a captain pointed out
2534973 when manoj tiwary went to australia i was intrigued still i tried to keep my cool now its virat kohli this is really going nowhere badrinath fumed
2534974 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
2534975 i dont know what badrinath has told the media but i cant discuss the outcome of the selection meeting with the press because it is confidential and not for the public
2534976 forget about the performance during the emerging players tournament even before that i scored heavily during india a series against australia and south africa and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competition was gautam gambhir
2534977 it baffled me when manoj tiwary went to australia but still i kept my cool now it is virat kohli this is really going nowhere none of the selectors have told me where i stand they should allow me to fail by picking me in the side if i am unable to prove my worth i will be a fringe player all my life
2534978 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2534979 the way i approached the game changed that day i just had one thing in my mind that i have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad
2534980 my first reaction was of absolute joy i could hardly believe it
2534981 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2534982 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations
2534983 he is a very physical type of player he likes to impose himself on the game backs it up with his skill
2534984 i cant be bogged down by a bowler i just like to give it back
2534985 i was asked to open the innings which i dont usually but i remained unbeaten on 120 and helped india win
2534986 he was disappointed that on a couple of occasions he didnt get as many runs as he should have simply because he had wanted to get a reasonable amount of runs a little bit too early therefore we agreed he should be looking to bat into the 40th over
2534987 he just told me to recognise my strong areas during the game and go for the shots i felt confident of and could pull off
2534988 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2534989 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon

2534993 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2534994 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2534995 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2534996 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2534997 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2534998 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2534999 i dont like my iphone its too sleek and good looking and its user interface is too elegant instead id like to subject myself to some nonsense from the traditional handset vendors
2535000 sure well charge you x and ship out a new handset when it arrives just activate and transfer your contacts
2535001 third party apps are for life not just for christmas
2535002 music purchased from apple for your ipod wont work on other brands of music players
2535003 a man not honorable in his marital relations is not usually honorable in any other
2535004 contrary to many lefty bloggers with large blogs who want to pretend this story isnt unfolding
2535005 tack s j ttemycket verkligen ingen har n gonsin bett f r mig f rut
2535006 rather rely on a subset of trusty old html than expend brain cells trying to remember the fake html way
2535007 the hero isnt supposed to die damn it were talking about love at first sight melting like an ice cream cone into a puddle of love overcoming the odds building a life together you cant end it this way
2535008 well i guess that false untrue ridiculous story about this son of a mill workers affair wasnt so false untrue ridiculous after all
2535009 the story is false its completely untrue its ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years the story is just false
2535010 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2535011 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
2535012 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date so i said i dont follow the rules ooooh it was so good
2535013 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2535014 no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2535015 america i heard your prayers and you wanted me here the mac man cometh and im bringing hell with me
2535016 its going to be 30 years for me and im going to call it
2535017 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2535018 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2535019 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2535020 the people in this town have been through so much loss this year and my heart goes out to them
2535021 theyve stood by me they gave me a sold out show youve got to pay it forward in life and thats what im doing here tonight
2535022 taylor was going to cancel the concert thinking few people could attend but the mayor of cedar rapids asked her to carry on
2535023 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2535024 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2535025 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2535026 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2535027 the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2535028 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2535029 there was an incident involving angie everhart and her boyfriend
2535030 he was gone from the location of the incident before deputies arrived there were minor injuries but they did not require medical attention he was subsequently booked for misdemeanor spousal battery
2535031 georgians are by nature extremely patriotic and this event has galvanized them together
2535032 it was as if georgia had won the world cup and was celebrating
2535033 i am obligated to defend the life and honor of russian citizens wherever they may be
2535034 we will not let those responsible for the death of our people go unpunished
2535035 he was able to speak boldly with the rulers of his country and of the west and with the people without fearing to speak the truth and without being a slave to fashion or public opinion
2535036 without a doubt he thought within a religious framework and his views on man and society were of a clearly religious character
2535037 solzhenitsyn in fact is not anti semitic his books are not anti semitic and he is not in his personal relations anti jewish
2535038 inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralised people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration
2535039 the french know this report is dynamite and wanted to keep it from seeing the light of day
2535040 this creates a new chapter and ends an old one
2535041 i think it all points to a profound disturbance in international relations caused by the emergence of an international legal system the very idea that there might be a legal process quite separate from politics is causing many people in many countries to rethink how they approach international relations
2535042 until rwanda in 1992 we tried to work with french political parties to improve french policies in africa
2535043 but the genocide which was clear to see even before it happened changed everything rwanda proved to us that there was absolutely no limit to what people were capable of doing in defending their interests
2535044 all roads to the truth were opened up in the 1998 investigation in france
2535045 but they did not go to the end of the road

2535048 despu s el tema ha sido aprovechado por elementos pol ticos interesados en que no se realice la obra
2535049 en el trabajo de prevenci n que realizaba la ona all yo no s como el gobierno lo analice la desactivaci n la situaci n no nos corresponde a nosotros si se desactiva ya esa es una decisi n pol tica lo que se deber a es reformar el decreto para que no haya colisi n con la ley en aquella parte donde se le encarga investigar delitos penales eso se debe reformar para evitar complicaciones de orden constitucional
2535050 nosotros cuestionamientos parte de ese decreto donde se encargaba a la ona la investigaci n del delito que era tarea del ministerio p blico en el rea preventiva nosotros dijimos que era un trabajo que le correspond a hacer todos somos prevenci n y si alguien deb a abocarse a la prevenci n para evitar la comisi n de delitos dijimos bienvenidos
2535051 en cuanto a investigaci n hay que fortalecer a los rganos que ya lo vienen haciendo y que requieren apoyo para poder trabajar con m s intensidad y en prevenci n todos tenemos que hacer lo que nos corresponde en cada una de nuestras tareas
2535052 tiene que ser una persona independiente que conozca del tema y con mucha solvencia moral
2535053 si observo que las demandas lista de militares todav a no han sido respondidas tratar de que se canalicen a trav s de mi despacho para ver si alg n pedido de la fiscal de la naci n es atendido es decir a trav s de oficina porque ahora lo est n haciendo directamente los fiscales veremos si as tenemos mayor suerte
2535054 ay dios ese es un problema que hemos tenido siempre con el ministerio de defensa a n no me ha comunicado nada el fiscal provincial del caso putis respecto a si ltimamente ha hecho un requerimiento pero voy a informarme porque eventualmente estoy pidiendo informes para que me digan de los problemas y dificultades que tienen los fiscales
2535055 seguimos trabajando hemos encontrado muchos restos incluso en huancavelica y seguimos avanzando en eso no hay problema la pol tica institucional es la misma en esos temas se dar un reforzamiento un apoyo y crecimiento de muchos aspectos pues no tenemos porque paralizarlos

2535057 remake of the classic spencer tracy and katharine hepburn drama
2535058 the violence being perpetrated by foreign born gang members and associates is as shocking as it is pervasive
2535059 what with going to kindergarten during the cuban missile crisis and my father taking me to see dr strangelove at age seven i believed for sure i was going to die in a nuclear apocalypse turning twenty came as a rude surprise to me since i had no real back up plan
2535060 uno de los cambios aut nticamente revolucionarios que ha vivido nuestro pa s en la ltima d cada es el de las familias espa olas eso es lo que trata de retratar este nuevo programa
2535061 se habla mucho de la crisis del modelo de familia lo cierto es que ha estallado en mil pedazos la familia nuclear caracter stica del siglo pasado en este caleidoscopio de familias lo nico que permanece son las firmes vinculaciones entre padres e hijos
2535062 para hacer una radiograf a de las nuevas familias espa olas nada mayor que darles una c mara para que ellas mismas se graben as nos asegur bamos que el realismo de los retratos siempre ser a superior si a eso a ad amos que los narradores fueran los m s peque os la autenticidad estaba conseguida

2535109 all possible efforts must be made to turn relatively decentralized terrorist networks into more formal more streamlined and more hierarchized hybrids this goal can best be achieved by encouraging the politicization and political transformation of major armed groups that employ terrorist means and the general demilitarization of politics especially in post conflict areas that implies stimulating the armed groups to becoming increasingly politicized and involved in non militant activities they should be encouraged to form distinctive and fully fledged political wings rather than merely civilian front organization for fund raising and propaganda purposes these political wings could then gradually develop a stake in increasing their legitimization and so develop into or join political parties and eventually be incorporated into the political process

2535272 sopudep school and the staff are a shining light for the children of haiti with nothing more than their own determination they have built a school that provides an unbelievable service to children that would otherwise have no means of obtaining any kind of education
2535273 it greatly disturbs me that such a success story in haiti should be under attack i have never met people more committed to doing what is right for the children of the community than the staff at sopudep school
2535274 the economic reality of haiti is such that a large proportion of children are inadequately nourished and unable to concentrate while in school i have seen the glazed look of hungry children in haitis schools sopudep has responded to this reality by instituting a feeding program guaranteeing hundreds of children one square meal every day of the week so they can focus on their studies
2535275 by threatening a closing of sopudep school the mayor of p tion ville is clearly showing a complete lack of concern for the health and future of her communitys most vulnerable members

2535283 john edwards the democrats 2004 vice presidential candidate and a potential cabinet member for barack obama tonight admitted that he had consistently lied about having an affair mr edwards had been dogged by internet gossip fuelled by anonymously sourced stories in the supermarket tabloid the national enquirer that he had an affair last year with rielle hunter a film maker while running for president it was also rumoured that he had fathered an illegitimate child in the relationship an allegation he continued to deny in an interview with abc news
2535284 the first sign of a nervous breakdown is when you start thinking your work is terribly important
2535285 no lawyer on the mainland has dared to speak out for uyghur suspects

2535287 i want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say maybe shes trying to understand her job better but if after a year nothing is happening then i wont vote for her again she said
2535288 i go frequently to our local schools and shopping centres and i havent seen her this year not since december
2535289 i thought wed be able to go and see her she said
2535290 we had a function on june 13 for olympians but her minders said she couldnt attend because she was overseas he said
2535291 certainly i think shes learning the ropes maybe she will be more outspoken and more visible then
2535292 its hard to understand what people want if you dont spend time here ms carritt said
2535293 the key point is that in rejecting partition in demanding everything and starting a war it could not win the arab side ensured endless conflict the palestinian refugee issue and no palestine it wasnt murder it was suicide
2535294 the corruption case against prime minister ehud olmert has earned israel tremendous respect throughout the arab world where many have called on their leaders to benefit from israels democratic system and independent judicial system
2535295 show me one arab or islamic country where a prime minister or a senior government official was ever questioned for financial corruption or bribery
2535296 the israeli regime with all its defects is better than all the arab democracies and still changes ministers and governments every few years
2535297 before we curse israel we must learn from the democratic and judicial system in israel where no one is above the law
2535298 although we are talking about israel which i have always hated very much there is still no one above the law there
2535299 we want this kind of accountability and transparency in the arab and islamic world
2535300 despite my strong hatred for the zionist regime i have a lot of admiration and respect for this entity because there is no one above the law in the arab world laws are broken every day and no one seems to care
2535301 i dont think we will live to see the day when the police interrogate an arab leader for sexually harassing his secretary or receiving bribes
2535302 nor will our children and grandchildren live to see that day what happened in israel can never happen in any arab country
2535303 but the difference is that the israelis hold their leaders accountable while we the arabs remain silent about corruption
2535304 the reason why israel has lasted for so long is because of its independent and fair judicial system i challenge the arabs to have such an independent judicial system
2535305 they say he received something like 3 000 a year
2535306 this shows that olmert is a decent man this is a small sum that any arab government official would receive on a daily basis as a bribe our leaders steal millions of dollars and no one dares to hold them accountable
2535307 in the arab world our leaders dont accept less than 1 million in bribes the money must be deposited in secret bank accounts in switzerland olmert is a fool if he took only a small sum
2535308 only a few thousand dollars what a fool this is what an egyptian minister gets in a day or what a saudi ceo gets in 45 minutes or a kuwaiti government official in five minutes this is what the physician of the emir of qatar gets every 30 seconds
2535309 there you can take as much money as you want even if they discover the theft they will erect a statue for you in a public square
2535310 can you imagine if there was an investigation against an arab or muslim leader do you know how much money they would discover
2535311 unfortunately this is the real democracy our enemies are very good in practicing democracy in the arab world our leaders steal everything and no one ever dares to ask a question
2535312 despite all our problems with the jews they are much better than us in fighting corruption and revealing the truth
2535313 israel is a state that deserves to exist it deserves our profound respect i wish i were a citizen of this state
2535314 this is democracy at its best enough of dictatorship in the arab world lets learn from the israeli example lets benefit from israels democracy
2535315 hamas accepts the establishment of an independent palestinian state on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital and with full and real sovereignty and full application of the right of the palestinian refugees to return but hamas will not recognize the state of israel

2535374 ladies and gentlemen we are faced with a budget that does not meet our wants or desires it is time for us to go line by line and determine how we can focus this money on the children
2535375 temporarily gas prices might go up as much as 20 cents a gallon but once we have
2535376 whether or not it has to be council is neither here nor there the key thing is that the government bring on as quickly as possible as much socially rented homes as we can create
2535377 but its also important that those homes are built in the right place and we dont go back to the council ghettos that we had in the past
2535378 decent housing for the many and not just the few
2535379 we need to build more homes across england the housing shortage means first time buyers and young families are finding it increasingly hard to get their first step onto the housing ladder unless they have financial help from parents or relatives and thats just not fair
2535380 unless we act now by 2026 first time buyers will find average house prices are ten times their salary that could lead to real social inequality and injustice
2535381 every part of the country needs more affordable homes in the north and the south in urban and rural communities
2535382 home ownership has fallen for the first time since records began first time buyers are at their lowest since 1980 and pay an average of 1 500 in stamp duty 8 000 in london where in 1997 the average was nothing
2535383 we will lend our cross party support to measures which build sustainable eco friendly communities on brownfield sites
2535384 we want to help more families get a first step on to the housing ladder if you havent got family or friends who can help it can be hard to get started in the long run we need to build more homes to ease the pressure on house prices but in the meantime this new mortgage deal will help thousands of families into a home of their own
2535385 rising house prices mean the chance to own a property is slipping out of the reach of many tenants but this scheme will give that opportunity to more people
2535386 it also offers advantages over existing schemes such as the right to buy because it offers more choice to tenants to select a property and is more affordable
2535387 this money is about extra support for those councils who are already doing their bit and some of are really doing a lot of work now to support additional housing but we know that others really need to do more and that is what this is about
2535388 otherwise people aren t going to get on the housing ladder in future
2535389 we are going to see more and more overcrowding people on council lists
2535390 for the sake of our sons and daughters we ve got to build more homes
2535391 you ve got to do it in a proper way that s protecting the green space that s protecting the countryside but you can t just put your head in the sand and say this is going to go away it won t it s not fair on future generations
2535392 many councils have already accepted the compelling case that with 1 6 million on council waiting lists and supply falling short by 60 000 or so households a year we need more homes we hope this will stimulate even more to consider increasing the land they identify for housing development
2535393 councils want to work with the government to build the new homes that the country needs
2535394 it is disappointing that this announcement seems to be rewarding councils for playing a crude numbers game and ignores the needs of the majority of councils with housing challenges
2535395 a key issue is where the money goes as there will be many areas that this money does not cover which will have equally as pressing housing needs for local families
2535396 what is also now necessary is for funding for the roads schools and hospitals needed to turn desolate dormitories into places where people can live and work
2535397 although we understand the minister s impatience we find it disappointing that this announcement does not recognise that many private companies are sitting on vast tracts of undeveloped land that they have yet to develop
2535398 if businesses could be encouraged to start building rather than sitting on brownfield land then many more affordable homes could be built

2535486 ora sparo una boiata non verificabile se ci credono forse un punto a mio favore
2535487 per tirare con larco non necessario saper tendere la corda

2535490 se tutto predeterminato allora perch se ad esmpio le succede qualcosa di spiacevole lei si rattrista
2535491 mi sposero il 15 con una tizia ma non lho ancora incontrata
2535492 ma sai e che il libero arbitrio non esiste piu quindi posso scrivere quel cazzo che voglio
2535493 234 libri e un numero impressionante per una ragazza della tua et specie se nel frattempo bisogna prestare energie ad altre attivit come lo studio non voglio soffermarmi sul tuo post che ho letto e riletto per capire che se volessi contestarlo dovrei scrivere un trattato lungo almeno il doppio del tuo senza per altro la bench minima speranza di eguagliare la tua prosa o di convincerti su una sola delle mie ragioni c chiaramente un abisso di vedute tra noi dovuto probabilmente anche alla tua preparazione e alla mia cialtronaggine ma sar ben lieto di tornare prima o poi qui a prendere visione se sar il caso e se sia tu che gli editori lo riterrete opportuno di una tua nuova performance su un mio libro ne giover il mio umore e spero anche il tuo cordialmente x
2535494 scrivere come cagare quando scappa scappa non ti puoi fermare se addosso non ti vuoi smerdare
2535495 lho messo anche sul mio blog contraccettivo ops controcorrente scusate lapsus freudiano gamberetta scusa sono stata esiziale mirabile dictu per me stata la troisi ps ho notato che gamberetta e clio alla fine di un periodo mettono il punto saranno mica la stessa persona ora vado mi prude lo sfintere

2535497 finch non vedremo pi ordine e imparzialit nei giudizi a 360 gradi noi continueremo ad imperversare con le nostre pungenti critiche
2535498 finch non vedremo ordine ed imparzialit nei giudizi a 360 gradi noi continueremo ad imperversare con le nostre pungenti critiche
2535499 lelevatezza linguistica che si bilancia con il ritmo sfrenato di unopera eroica
2535500 lelevatezza linguistica che si bilancia con il ritmo sfrenato di unopera eroica
2535501 tagliarsi le balle da soli come si fa con i capponi allo scopo di renderne le carni pi grasse
2535502 come il fatto che pur non essendosi mai visti leoni in argolide ercole ne uccida uno e ne vesta la pelle
2535503 ercole palombaro che uccide leoni marini in scozia a gomitate
2535504 ercole che uccide pinguini armati di mazze da golf in argolide
2535505 questo romanzo fa schifo lincipit e molto debole e poi non succede nulla per pagine e pagine
2535506 e veramente lanticamera della censura e questo da te non me laspettavo mi hai lasciato di sasso
2535507 io dopo che ho dato dellidiota a qualcuno non rimango a rompere lanima a casa sua
2535508 wow argomenta quel che dice con basi solide una rarit di questi tempi
2535509 gamberetta una dittatrice il suo blog anti democratico e tutti ne siamo vittime
2535510 non penso che linfodump selvaggio sia pulcioso un errore piuttosto grave
2535511 gli errori sono errori come tali ce li hanno anche i romanzi belli ma i romanzi belli non hanno gli errori gravi
2535512 nihal no sono quasi solo difetti ma non potrebbe essere altrimenti
2535513 comunque sergio fermo restando che quei temi potevano essere considerati freschi un 4 500 anni fa
2535514 non sono antisemita perch mi piace la scrittura di primo levi
2535515 voglio un libro che qualifichi litalia come paese competitivo in quanto a fantasy
2535516 io sapevo da ricerche in giro che non che avessero avuto sto grandioso successo vendite si ok ma niente di paragonabile agli altri libri e comunque come hai detto tu circoscrivibili alla sola germania che insomma
2535517 dovremmo conquistare i mercati ben pi competitivi dellinghilterra e dellamerica un attacco alle fondamenta del fantasy insomma vabb ok anche noi siamo una delle fondamenta del fantasy ma ce ne siamo dimenticati a met strada purtroppo
2535518 capacit prospettica dellautore di far visualizzare ci che si legge
2535519 se si fa unanalisi cos tutte le opere divengono brutte
2535520 sei solo invidiosa perch non hai i soldi per pubblicare a pagamento
2535521 va bene la critica ma non si pu offendere lautore
2535522 bisogna leggere con grande attenzione fino in fondo un romanzo
2535523 tra i sottili lineamenti degli occhi a mandorla brillavano due gemme cerulee come il cielo terso striate di zaffiro
2535524 tu puoi essere laureato in storia medievale filosofia orientale letteratura italiana greca latina e swahili tutto ci non ti avvicina di un dito allo scrivere buona narrativa
2535525 marcy angra zaffini non c peggior sordo di chi non vuol sentire ragazzi vi ripeto per la centesima volta che sentire da voi che la mia forma scorretta che ci sono errori ed altre boiate senza il minimo riscontro nella realt come sentire un neonato che cerca di elaborare teorie di fisica quantistica non siete competenti ne istruiti a dovere per farlo lo volete capire o preferite rimanere ottusamente nel vostro livello scarso e inascoltato
2535526 quel 68 ha fatto danni ben pi gravi di quanto credessi
2535527 zaffini non c peggior sordo di chi non vuol sentire ragazzi vi ripeto per la centesima volta che sentire da voi che la mia forma scorretta che ci sono errori ed altre boiate senza il minimo riscontro nella realt come sentire un neonato che cerca di elaborare teorie di fisica quantistica non siete competenti ne istruiti a dovere per farlo lo volete capire o preferite rimanere ottusamente nel vostro livello scarso e inascoltato
2535528 io continuer a contraddirvi dando dimostrazione lampante che la vostra conoscenza sulla materia molto ma davvero molto scarsa
2535529 vi ripeto che meglio lo scambio bilaterale piuttosto che il tentativo senza speranza di umiliare me o altri con uninesistente preparazione sulla materia trattata
2535530 un pregio anche lo stile di scrittura davvero fuori dagli schemi a tratti anche sboccato ma che spesso strappa un sorriso e rende meglio di mille parole educate
2535531 quello che colpisce di pi lo stile immediato graffiante crudo ma senza indulgere a splatter gratuito luso dei vocaboli dianamico e innovativo la narrazione al presente che incalza il lettore e lo sospinge pagina dopo pagina
2535532 la sua scrittura tanto irriverente quanto affascinante per come senza peli sulla lingua presenta orrori e sorrisi alternandoli con bravura
2535533 complimenti a luca per la maestria con cui ha saputo guidare un neofita di fantascienza per 320 pagine capolavoro in 320 minuti o gi di l
2535534 non vi dir delle solite cose sulla prosa graffiante o sui personaggi mai scontati
2535535 il silenzio si fece sentire nuovamente nella carrozza mentre una folata di vento gelido faceva irruzione nellabitacolo
2535536 38 most common fiction writing mistakes and how to avoid them
2535537 cavallo robusto possente e infaticabile usato anche come cavallo da guerra
2535538 io ho 1000 lauree e quindi ho ragione voi siete ignoranti e non avete il diritto di parlare cos solo i professori universitari possono criticarmi
2535539 ragazzi fate i bravi toni pi moderati e pacati vi prego
2535540 quando il tuo lavoro ti rompe e sei sullorlo della depressione e niente va come vorresti fai cos
2535541 il signore delle tenebre ha rapito la figlia del re degli eterni e a dardamen la guerra alle porte il giovane lyannen mezzomortale innamorato della principessa si offre di partire con un gruppo di fedeli amici per salvarla slyman non ha mai visto dardamen cresciuto lontano da tutto e tutti non sa da dove viene n di chi figlio non sa nemmeno chi ma si unir a lyannen e gli altri per salvare il regno una missione costellata di avventure mozzafiato tra fate amazzoni ka da lun e pixies paludi e nebbie profezie e segreti rivelati
2535542 da segnalare qualche caduta di stile in espressioni a volta involute ripetizioni di sostantivi ed errate corrispondenze fra soggetti e verbi
2535543 penso che non tutte le persone abbiano il diritto di esprimersi
2535544 ne ho lette tre pagine e lho trovato scritto in maniera indegna tale da farmi perdere ogni desiderio di continuare
2535545 a mio parere il modo di scrivere si pu anche correggere poi uno mano a mano che pubblica pu capire cosa non arriva e cosa arriva alla gente dei suoi romanzi racconti e non si pu pretendere da un libro desordio a mio parere mettetevi voi li domani a scrivere un libro dove mescolate tante conoscenze diverse potrebbe uscire uno schifo immondo anche il vostro non solo quello di neo scrittori come sergio rocca et simila
2535546 cosa non arriva e cosa arriva alla gente dei suoi romanzi
2535547 rocca ha vinto amici di maria de filippi giuro che vero carta stato squalificato allultimo momento e il bello che non ha neppure partecipato rocca meglio di chuck norris
2535548 il partito del signor rocca partito chiaviche del fato pcf
2535549 questo bambino e triste no guarda e proprio triste sul serio e davvero tristissimo non so se mi sono spiegato bene sta cosi male che se va avanti cosi per altri cinque minuti crepa
2535550 questa parte divertente dovevi approfondirla di pi qui hai sbrodolato peggio di un poppante lascia perdere e scrivi pulito
2535551 uffa ai miei prof piace voi non capite niente bugiardi cattivi
2535552 una delle cose pi brutte che abbia letto in uno scritto di narrativa da tempo e qui non parliamo di un appassionato al quale si pu perdonare tutto o quasi qui si parla di un ragazzo che ha pubblicato un libro e per questo non vuol sentire critiche
2535553 tra i sottili lineamenti degli occhi a mandorla brillavano due gemme cerulee come il cielo terso striate di zaffiro il bambino guardava gli erbosi prati che scorrevano oltre il foro della carrozza lo stridio del cocchio tirato da robusti e infaticabili frisoni lo scalpitio dei cavalli al trotto il ballonzolare delle ruote sul terreno sassoso e inumidito dallo scroscio della notte precedente giungevano ovattati alla mente di odino
2535554 tra sottili palpebre a mandorla brillavano gli occhi cerulei di un bambino guardava il paesaggio scorrere velocemente attraverso il finestrino della carrozza che sobbalzava ad ogni imperfezione del terreno fangoso ogni rumore giungeva alle sue orecchie come ovattato indistinto
2535555 anzi vorrei proporvi una cosa perch non iniziamo a scrivere commenti solo in latino non colpa di rocca litaliano che una lingua davvero volgare in alternativa scegliete pure unaltra lingua purch rigorosamente morta siamo tutti intellettuali qui
2535556 gli occhi cerulei del bambino guardavano i prati che scorrevano oltre la finestra della carrozza
2535557 scoprire lesistenza di un autore fantasy bergamasco mi ha fatto piacere poi dopo aver letto lestratto e i commenti di mitoancess ora sono ancora pi orgoglioso di essere un piemontese in terra orobica e non un autoctono
2535558 venuto jerry a farci la morale e citando il sito dellinternazionale addirittura grazie jerry per averci illuminato esseri superiori come te neppure nel cielo sopra berlino complimenti la cosa bella di questi esseri superiori che scendono fino al nostro basso livello per farci notare quanto loro siano superiori civili belli e bravi vergogniamoci tutti ok grazie grazie jerry
2535559 ecco arrivato lessere superiore il dio in terra etc etc
2535560 perch dovremmo essere pi pacati qual il senso neanche su internet si pu essere un p sinceri un p cazzari
2535561 se ripensiamo al dialogho da attore drammatico quarantenne del bambino ci accorgiamo subito che il signor rocca non ha saputo ben definire questo personaggio
2535562 nella mia universit sottolineo di lettere i laureandi sono di livello talmente elevato che i professori prima di accettare qualcuno come tesista fanno un colloquio orale e soprattutto una prova scritta per vedere se lo studente capace di mettere per iscritto un pensiero senza incappare in errori orrori
2535563 eh sapete solo se siete esperti di filologia lappone trecentesca potete capire
2535564 la volta in cui qualcuno vi incontrer e a questa persona non piacer la punta del vostro naso e non gli piacer non cercher di conoscere il resto di voi
2535565 la volta in cui qualcuno vi incontrer e a questa persona non piacer la punta del vostro naso non cercher di conoscere il resto di voi
2535566 sacrosanto avere unopinione ma bisogna avere delle competenze per esprimere giudizi
2535567 per dire che un bambino ha gli occhi azzurri deve usare due metafore e una similitudine
2535568 linsistenza su particolari inutili come le striature zaffiro sul ceruleo
2535569 i robusti e infaticabili frisoni i due aggettivi sono di troppo e il secondo esiziale visto

2535572 il bello che non frega un tubo neanche al lettore del nuovo sovrano dei regni di aesir e dellanello di congiunzione fra occidente e oriente
2535573 sono solo parole non stanno comunicando niente riferito ad una descrizione

2535585 mi ha dato di pi leggere il pensierino scolastico di mia sorella di otto anni

2535591 fai agli altri ci che vorresti fosse fatto a te
2535592 tanto per cominciare la recensione piena di acredine e accanimento vero ma la situazione rende comprensibile tutto ci
2535593 leggendo sembra che lautore voglia essere ricercato e ricco e va a finire che sovrabbondante
2535594 tra i sottili lineamenti degli occhi a mandorla brillavano due gemme cerulee come il cielo striate di zaffiro
2535595 no il gessetto sulla lavagna sgtride la chiave nella serratura stride un maialetto scannato stride un suono differente dal cigolio e ad ogni modo io sui carri cho viaggiato di tanto in tanto e non calessini da turisti ma non li ho mai sentiti cigolare poi tutto possibile ma cigolare non stridere
2535596 il bello che non frega un tubo neanche al lettore del nuovo sovrano dei regni di aesir e dellanello di congiunzione fra occidente e oriente se nella storia ininfluente perch mettercelo per dare un po di colore locale
2535597 giustissimo ma qui il bambino non sta parlando il bambino sta pensando diverso
2535598 penso che tutti quelli che si interessano almeno un pochino allepoca medievale conoscano le goff xd ti consiglio anche regine pernaud
2535599 il paragone con le opere medievali lascia il tempo che trova se io scrivessi in italiano trecentesco non mi pubblicherebbe e leggerebbe nessuno la narrativa si evolve puoi anche sostenere si evolva in peggio ma questo un altro discorso e se si vuole essere letti occorre farsi capire
2535600 lortografia non fa parte del testo i segni di interpunzione non contano nulla
2535601 qui non ammetto repliche larte visiva il mio campo e so di quel che parlo
2535602 tu voi come giudicate se un libro merita o meno di essere comprato

2535607 il bambino ha gli occhi azzurri azzurri no ma davvero azzurri
2535608 il bambino ha gli occhi azzurri ma con delle venature di una pietra che pu avere dodici toni differenti
2535609 per dire che un bambino ha gli occhi azzurri deve usare due metafore e una similitudine
2535610 no virgola certo che non e proibito virgola pero nemmeno pisciare controvento lo e punto e a capo
2535611 devessere proprio il tuo caso perch oltre a qualche troglodita che bela in questo spazio che mi ricorda lambiente dei pollai e dei porcili non trovi consensi elevati
2535612 quando invece voglio avere uno scambio culturale o qualche critica appropriata mi rivolgo a personalit che sanno di cosa stanno parlando e hanno i requisiti per aiutarmi ad elevare il mio livello di preparazione e non solo
2535613 ho compassione di te poverina se vuoi ti do qualche ripetizione di italiano latino greco

2535615 non dar retta a chi usa vocaboli come esiziale quando non ne conosce neanche il significato infatti usato in contesti come la medicina e la giurisprudenza ma in letteratura temo che scusate ma sto per rimettere la cena
2535616 e si persuaderanno che i frutti delleterodossia cartesiana sono cos tristi ed esiziali in letteratura e nelle arti
2535617 con tutta umilt non mi reputo ancora in grado di fare analisi comparate nonostante la mia preparazione
2535618 lepica praticamente il contrario del romanzo che non per niente viene detto
2535619 hai detto bene io mi occupo di antichit medioevo e seppure in via minore di oriente
2535620 te lo dice una persona che ne ha letti appena venti di fantasy ma lo ha fatto con una
2535621 stalin lho citato perch la repressione comunista che ha ripudiato anche il comunismo italiano a suo tempo

2535623 per dire che un bambino ha gli occhi azzurri deve usare due metafore e una similitudine
2535624 ora ne ho 20 ed ho reso lo stile decisamente pi sobrio
2535625 se c una cosa che non sopporto il terrorismo intellettuale
2535626 vede sa qual il pericolo di scrivere su internet ogni tanto pu passare qualcuno che ha il tempo la voglia e le conoscenze per disinnescare i nostri poveri petardi eruditi stavolta sono passato io ma sarebbe bastata una scolaresca in gita
2535627 s il beowulf pieno di kenningar e i fragmenta di dittologie sinonimiche andiamo si capisce benissimo che l intento dell autore non scrivere un trattato di filologia romanza germanica rendiamoci conto che con la lingua si rischia se le parole non le hai addomesticate con gli studi e la lettura alla fine ci fai la figura del fesso proprio come in questo caso
2535628 beowulf e il kenning ar roarrrrrr ignorante si dice kenning e basta e il tanga del barbaro
2535629 elisione elidere e intensiva ledere che vuol dire manomettere danneggiare

2535635 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2535636 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2535637 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2535638 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2535639 alleen k rwacht niet op het de release vn me laatste alf bum k maak elk e voelt als een pimp dan schud je bie shit van je schouder als je je voelt zoals
2535640 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2535641 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2535643 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
2535644 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
2535645 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
2535646 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
2535647 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
2535648 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
2535649 the people who talk that way think that monkeys can do this
2535650 we dont need a point weve got eve mendes nipples
2535651 this perfume will help me take my shirt off and show my nipples
2535652 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2535653 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2535655 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2535656 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2535657 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2535658 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2535659 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2535660 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring

2535662 una mia alunna che ha ammazzato il marito mi ha scritto che
2535663 strutturalmente incapaci di stare al mondo e consapevoli di questo al punto di prenderla a ridere affaticate dagli altri e per gli altri piuttosto faticose persone che sentivano di avere qualcosa che non andava e a cui invece rocco pi o meno implicitamente e con lesempio lampante della sua stessa esistenza sembrava dire proprio quella cosa che di te pensi non vada quella che pi funziona
2535664 e pi in generale precisa l organizzatore sergio nordio ordinario di pediatria e direttore scientifico dell istituto per l infanzia di trieste ci soffermeremo sulla cultura musicale del bambino che proprio mozart ci suggerisce
2535665 il modo in cui la tradizione classica si rivolge ai bambini presuppone una societ in cui la musica davvero una componente importante del mondo infantile e dove il compositore trasferisce il proprio sapere musicale su alcuni sistemi di riferimento infantili dal suono dei giocattoli alla trama delle fiabe ma la nostra societ molto cambiata
2535666 e dalla tv sostiene che proviene quel repertorio di canzoni per lo pi sigle di cartoni animati che costituisce il primo percorso del bambino nel suono mentre i compositori colti si rivolgono soltano ai virtuali musicisti con una produzione prevalentemente strumentale l universo della musica commerciale va incontro alle esigenze dei pi piccoli proponendo per il 99 per cento dei casi musica vocale i due mondi al momento rimangono separati occorrerebbe invece ripensare la musica come linguaggio prima ancora che come arte un linguaggio per tutti
2535667 se la politica diviene ostaggio del denaro il collegamento tra concentrazione della ricchezza e corruzione della politica diventa inevitabile
2535668 like all within the bsb community we are deeply saddened at the loss of craig following his accident last weekend
2535669 the british championships formed a large part of craigs career and i know he kept a keen interest on them as we did with his world championship exploits
2535670 craig will perhaps be best remembered by his two years on the distinctive yellow valmoto triumph and who can forget
2535671 ive not had the best of seasons but i am pretty happy with this
2535672 ive got a good set up in both the dry and now the wet so i cant wait to get going in these races
2535673 it is all about winning races and that is what i am here for
2535674 oooh hes been ever so naughty wont do his homework or go to bed when i tell him and the other week i found him in his bedroom with a blond woman mind you she was only helping him with his diving technique

2535678 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
2535679 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
2535680 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
2535681 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
2535682 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
2535683 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
2535684 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
2535685 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
2535686 bush lectures chinese government as it apes his own free speech zone policy

2535911 rusia ha lanzado una invasi n militar a gran escala de georgia
2535912 los ataques se dan en regiones de georgia que est n lejos de la zona de conflicto en osetia del sur marcan una escalada peligrosa en la crisis

2535920 just in his tax policies alone mccain is saving corporate america 175 billion a year
2535921 theyre doing the public offering now so that the compensation can be taxed at the lower rate while bush is still in office
2535922 theyre betting obama is going to win and theyre getting their money while they can

2535928 wall street will want to be at the head of the table
2535929 they want to make sure theres socialism when they need it bailouts and capitalism when they need that

2535955 one of the major reasons to go forward with the pda is so i dont cause offense with others in the church
2535956 they promote the idea of going along with the government as long as its not against gods word or the bible
2535957 they dont feel the prohibitions on milk products are against gods will
2535958 its so obvious that the pda wants to make glen a poster child for the raw milk permit
2535959 the state tested the cows the milk the barn and the farms dairy equipment tests found e coli in the fecal matter of one cow and investigators said they believe that fecal matter could have gotten into the milk during or after the milking process the department stresses the e coli contamination was external and was not found in milk samples from the cows

2535968 where is the legislation to prevent these illnesses these people should not be in icu fighting for their lives just because they went out to dinner we have the ability to legislate regulate and eliminate e coli from our food supply and we need to see congressional action
2535969 it is important to realize that nais is not about food safety the program supposedly is to track animals for issues of animal health and besides doing this poorly or not at all nais in fact would stop all tracking at the point of slaughter and as we have learned in many recent meat recalls what happens after slaughter when meat may be contaminated and comingled is where the problem lies nais would offer nothing even if it were fully implemented to assist in such food safety concerns food safety as the meat and tomato recalls illustrate is a far different problem there is one commonality however the small diversified farms which will be harmed by nais are the same farms which bring locally grown meat and produce to local farmers markets damaging these small farms economically is a food safety issue since local food is demonstrably some of the safest food which americans can count on as against the current broken system which corporate agriculture offers
2535970 the hartford connecticut courant reported that the town farm dairy has stopped producing and selling milk and milk products indefinitely after four people contracted e coli o157 h7 linked to raw milk they bought from the simsbury farm we learned that the four ill are children ages 2 7 and that some if not all developed hemolytic uremic syndrome

2535976 i have been blogging about raw milk for awhile i am busier than ever
2535977 deeded to the town for the benefit of the poor
2535978 the initial test of milk came back negative theres no link except the circumstance
2535979 one turned out to be the day care center the knee jerk reaction is that this must be raw milk
2535980 three of those people reported consuming raw milk before they got sick
2535981 or the regulation of cigarette and alcohol sales to minors
2535982 food has a proven record as a source of food borne infections
2535983 raw milk has a proven record as a source of food borne infections
2535984 how then can these people explain the steady stream of outbreaks and infections traced unequivocally back to the consumption of unpasteurized milk
2535985 the children that claimed they were sickened have fully recovered and lead normal and healthy lives
2535986 please be informed and accurate anything else is unfair and borders on libel
2535987 the suggestion we let things slide before we left is completely untrue and an attempt to find someone to blame in a tragic event that could happen to anyone we had a testing regime that was above and beyond what is required or what the original farmer had in place and are fanatical about sanitation practices and keeping any abnormal or high scc milk out of the tank as soon as we realize theres a problem we are not cheerleaders for raw milk and discouraged new customers from drinking it but we believe it should be available if people understand the risks and accept responsibility for them
2535988 when we were hired we thought it was going to be great to work for that farm it had a good business plan and a model based on being generous to the poor and educating the public it was in the process of transitioning from a private business to a non profit but we had no idea how badly that was going when we came dairy farming especially with on farm processing is hugely capital intensive but the organization had not come up with the money and had no plan except to continue to borrow everything without compensating the original farmer who was now the farm manager we were horrified when we found out but also couldnt do a lot about it except agitate on his behalf
2535989 we had one test with a high scc somatic cell count in early june as well as a high count from the same batch from the state one person called saying they had a stomach ache we offered a refund and immediately took the cows indicated to have a high cell count out of the line
2535990 ive never seen a cleaner farm or tasted better milk this is something that could happen to anyone at anytime despite their best efforts
2535991 no e coli has shown up in any of the samples we have from that time period
2535992 high scc indicates infection and is a shelf life and quality issue not a contamination issue after we left one of our former employees called to say there was a high coliform not e coli thats separate test result we discussed possibilities with her wash temp new milkers not following procedures cow shedding bacteria and ultimately they decided to suspend sales
2535993 we are not completely convinced it was the milk after all we bottled and sold 200 gallons of raw milk per week so many more people consumed it and did not get sick i offer our sincerest apologies to the affected families if it was the milk but we were doing everything we could to ensure a safe quality product and had no indication of e coli while we were there we left for unrelated reasons and had hoped a new farmer with no history with the old farmer could set things right
2535994 ive never seen a cleaner farm or tasted better milk this is something that could happen to anyone at anytime despite their best efforts
2535995 two facts stand out to me first no e coli has been discovered
2535996 second hundreds of people consumed the milk each week 200 gallons gets poured into the glasses of many more family members yet only four people became ill
2535997 i read this statement and once again wonder if it is worth the risk to give children raw milk
2535998 the key is to be honest and look back at these outbreaks to see if there could have been a way to prevent it
2535999 is it worth the risk of feeding children processed foods
2536000 first there needs to be a difinitive source otherwise they do not know where it came from and cannot determine how to prevent it
2536001 stop feeding raw milk to kids and promoting the practice to naive parents then ill sleep easier
2536002 also if you need a lab to give you negative e coli o157 h7 results to make you feel good darth is available for a price i have a lab that will never find any pathogens in your milk or cows and my prices are competitive
2536003 there is no evidence that kids are less obese or otherwise better off after drinking raw milk other than some emotional testimonies
2536004 compels us to consider bovine mfgm as a potential nutraceutical
2536005 all in all its a wonderful way to engage with your customers get a better feeling about price perception other than setting your prices in a vacuum and it can help you increase your sell through rate significantly

2536014 online retailing entering its next phase and a major showdown is taking place
2536015 traditionally vips rely on word of mouth to gain access to exclusive sale events these happenings often occur in a back alley without signage and well after closing hours now thanks to the internet there is no need to peek down darkened streets
2536016 1 depending on your product you can use one of the growing number of online private sale services is arguably the most famous of all of these in europe but more seem to be springing up koodos offers a fairly simple private sales service for example
2536017 id go as far as agreeing that private sales are an alternative to ebay but really i dont buy it and im sure that neither will anyone else why as a retailer would you want to do a private sale on a site thats unknown and numbers its visitors in hundreds rather than hundreds of millions yes theres the chance to get a higher price than you would on ebay but is the extra work involved in inviting people to the sale and the cost of publicising the sale really worth that effort lets not forget this is old stock or its overstock isnt it better to just get rid of it and concentrate on your current stock

2536020 judging by your feedburner subscribers ecommerce is hot in germany
2536021 online auctions have more potential than most people currently realize auctions seem boring now because ebay is doing a bad job but is still powerful enough that they have a de facto monopoly result stagnation but i suspect ebay could now be attacked on its home territory and that this territory would in the hands of a successful invader turn out to be more valuable than it currently appears as with dating however a startup that wants to do this has to expend more effort on their strategy for cracking the monopoly than on how their auction site will work

2536026 oddly enough this is my first official ceo blog post even though conceptually we started out woot by planning the first blog store
2536027 sales stats are posted to increase the intelligence of conversation and expectations scope is really relevant and often underestimated
2536028 the very large majority of woot members have never commented and nor will they be reading a specific blog entry i occasionally remind staff and observers that no matter how great the participation is and vocal response is the silent majority is to be considered unspoken we are all their interpreters
2536029 cathy lewis in terms of competition we feel that there is ample opportunity in this market for a number of participants the current vendors like stratasys zcorp objet and 3d systems are not household names as you see in the 2d printing space in fact few outside the industry have ever heard of them and after almost 20 years they continue to be relatively small companies with revenues ranging from 50m to 150m dollars annually and most of them with one exception are very profitable and growing rapidly they tend to sell through distributors and they may be too busy satisfying current customer needs and moving into rapid manufacturing to worry about what we are doing at least for the time being however one can never take their eye off of the prize fabbaloo final question when can we get one cathy lewis we are planning on placing several local beta units with customers when we complete this round of testing those placements will be in the first quarter of 2009 after which we will begin our commercial launch please keep in mind that we do have 350 units on order at this time and we will prioritize those customers first and remember we will update testing beta and launch on a regular basis via our desktop factory newsletter

2536035 the congress shall have power to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning captures on land and water
2536036 leaving to the executive the power to repel sudden attacks
2536037 the sense of congress regarding the threat posed to international peace stability in the middle east and the vital national security interests of the united states by irans pursuit of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony and for other purposes
2536038 demands that the president initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic political and diplomatic pressure on iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by inter alia prohibiting the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo entering or departing iran and prohibiting the international movement of all iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of irans nuclear program
2536039 whereas nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization of the use of force against iran
2536040 it should be the policy of the united states to seek to remove the saddam hussein regime from power in iraq and to replace it with a democratic government
2536041 no assistance under this section shall be provided to any group within an organization designated in accordance with section 5 which group is at the time the assistance is to be provided engaged in military cooperation with the saddam hussein regime
2536042 urges the president to call upon the united nations to establish an international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting prosecuting and imprisoning saddam hussein and other iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity genocide and other criminal violations of international law
2536043 nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize or otherwise speak to the use of united states armed forces except as provided in section 4 a 2 in carrying out this act
2536044 authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002
2536045 the president is authorized to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq
2536046 for more than half a century the american israel public affairs committee has worked to help make israel more secure by ensuring that american support remains strong
2536047 foreign lobbyists and satraps to gather round the imperial throne scheming and plotting to gain the emperors favor and the privilege of using his praetorians as an instrument to advance their own ends as raimondo suggests
2536048 duty and interest of the united states require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers
2536049 the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world
2536050 constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors and of yet being reproached for not giving more there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation it is an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard
2536051 peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none
2536052 america in the assembly of nations since her admission among them has invariably though often fruitlessly held forth to them the hand of honest friendship of equal freedom of generous reciprocity she has uniformly spoken among them though often to heedless and often to disdainful ears the language of equal liberty of equal justice and of equal rights she has in the lapse of nearly half a century without a single exception respected the independence of other nations while asserting and maintaining her own she has abstained from interference in the concerns of others even when conflict has been for principles to which she clings as to the last vital drop that visits the heart she has seen that probably for centuries to come all the contests of that aceldama the european world will be contests of inveterate power and emerging right wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled there will her heart her benedictions and her prayers be but she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy she is the well wisher to the freedom and independence of all she is the champion and vindicator only of her own she will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice and the benignant sympathy of her example she well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own were they even the banners of foreign independence she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue of individual avarice envy and ambition which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom the fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force she might become the dictatress of the world she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit americas glory is not dominion but liberty her march is the march of the mind she has a spear and a shield but the motto upon her shield is freedom independence peace this has been her declaration this has been as far as her necessary intercourse with the rest of mankind would permit her practice
2536053 observe good faith and justice towards all nations cultivate peace and harmony with all religion and morality enjoin this conduct and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it
2536054 as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of mussulmen and as the said states never entered into any war or act of hostility against any mahometan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries
2536055 american power and actions over the years have done a good deal albeit inadvertently to cause but cannot now easily or by themselves redress
2536056 americas democracy is not an exportable commodity it is unique to the united states and the product of 800 years of heroes and villains war and civil war racial strife and racial reconciliation and foolishness and common sense it is grounded in britains political experience scottish commonsense philosophy british common law calvinist protestant christianity and the absolute requirement of an educated populace to evaluate and when necessary check the policies ambitions and greed of elected officials
2536057 a coherent foreign policy is based on the understanding that america is best served by not interfering in the deadly conflicts that define the middle east yes we need middle eastern oil but we can reduce our need by exploring domestic sources we should rid ourselves of the notion that we are at the mercy of the oil producing countries as the worlds largest oil consumer their wealth depends on our business we should stop the endless game of playing faction against faction and recognize that buying allies doesnt work we should curtail the heavy militarization of the area by ending our disastrous foreign aid payments we should stop propping up dictators and putting band aids on festering problems we should understand that our political and military involvement in the region creates far more problems than it solves all americans will benefit both in terms of their safety and their pocketbooks if we pursue a coherent neutral foreign policy of non interventionism free trade and self determination in the middle east

2536063 the vast majority of emergency medical technicians are responsible hard working people who provide critical services to californians
2536064 we depend on them to respond to life threatening situations such as heart attacks gunshot wounds and car accidents but right now there is no statewide standard for background checks and before they are sent into public service we should review their history more closely given the reports of criminal history and unqualified emts who fell through the cracks
2536065 california could lose its global role in the design and manufacture of technologies without implementing its own proactive aggressive and comprehensive strategy for supporting californias technology based industries
2536066 this bill would keep california s regional economies vibrant by identifying opportunities and challenges in attracting investment for emerging domestic markets using models and strategies that encourage partnerships with public academic and private entities
2536067 the historical success of california has been based on its ability to support innovators in a wide range of fields however the global game board for innovation is transforming by the day ab 1916 is needed because few agendas could be more important for the future of california than pursing a clear comprehensive intentional and smart strategy for innovation
2536068 as we go home this weekend please be mindful of the fact that there are still hundreds of people fighting wildfires in california some of them at great risk
2536069 we have a lot of very brave young men and women who are risking their lives to keep our communities safe
2536070 life goes on for many of us but for some of us it doesn t
2536071 i want to adjourn in the memory of and have your thoughts and prayers focus on the families of these brave people who gave their lives in service for the state of california
2536072 my aim with assembly bill 2911 is to give the same attention to oil spills in our state s inland waterways that is currently enjoyed by our coastal waters
2536073 because coastal oil spills may grab the headlines but inland spills threaten public health and safety by contaminating the water we drink our rivers creeks marshes and the delta
2536074 inland spills are also much more common occurring more than twice as often as marine spills yet the state responds to less than a third of reported inland spills
2536075 when students enroll in college they expect not only to receive a quality education they expect to enjoy the complete college experience
2536076 students and families expect campuses to be diverse and reflect the boarder community at large clearly we have fallen short of that goal
2536077 as i campaigned door to door i found that many california high school students struggle with the decision between attending an hbcu on the east coast or staying close to home acr 21 would offer the best and brightest students from california and throughout the u s the best of both options a quality uc experience and the chance to study at an historically black college or universities
2536078 just yesterday the san jose mercury news reported on uc students and their efforts to increase diversity on their campuses
2536079 most students i come across as chairman of the assembly higher education committee are hungry for more diversity and with proposition 209 on the books for over ten years their individual outreach efforts are one of the few legal ways left to change the face of future classes of students acr 21 will send a strong message to the uc that the california legislature expects diversity to remain tantamount of this world renowned institution of higher learning i am extremely proud that the every legislative black caucus member is are co authors of this resolution
2536080 the republican budget delay is a clear assault on california s working families already resulting in low wage state employees being fired at the same time working families are losing out on their chance to gain an important new benefit republicans are helping oil companies and yacht owners avoid paying their fair share
2536081 the overwhelming support for ab 2716 crosses party lines and voters recognize how important this bill is for public health
2536082 i will continue to work every day i am in office to ensure that california s working families have the ability to take a day to recover from illness without the fear of being fired or losing a day s pay
2536083 assembly bill 2321 must include funding to extend metro s green line two miles to los angeles international airport
2536084 for weeks i have been pushing to include money for the green line extension to be part of this measure there is no doubt this should be one of the highest priorities in l a county this project would impact travelers and their families throughout the region
2536085 as a member of the senate appropriations committee i am fighting to ensure the green line gets funding at present there is no money for this project
2536086 some argue there s not enough time to make adjustments and still get the half cent sales tax on the november ballot
2536087 i have been assured by l a county registrar recorder dean logan that there is time
2536088 because this bill sets up the mass transit plan for the next 30 years we have to get it right the first time to delay action for a week to make sure we nail it is worth the wait
2536089 the point here is to boost our recycling rate to above 90 percent
2536090 but the building does not offer the service we re going to change that

2536094 the high speed rail bond is better as a result of senator yee s efforts and his amendment to ab 3034
2536095 senator yee has rightfully fought to ensure that priority is given to the main line from san francisco to anaheim protecting the future of california s transportation network
2536096 the high speed rail bond has always been about finding ways to get millions of people out of cars and airplanes and into a cost saving and environmentally sound transportation portal
2536097 a piecemeal approach is not what is best for commuters visitors or the economy and is certainly not what is best for our environment as an advocate for high speed rail i will continue to be steadfast in securing the san francisco to los angeles corridor of the bullet train and then branching out to other cities
2536098 this bill will ensure that the high speed rail bond on this november s ballot contains important environmental and fiscal safeguards and accordingly will help assure voters that their money will be wisely invested in a system that can dramatically improve california s environment while providing mobility options that improve our competitiveness and quality of life
2536099 ab 3034 now has some great amendments including senator yees plan to restore the primacy of los angeles to san francisco
2536100 the senate version of this bill is superior los angeles to san francisco is necessary to be the spine of the project and the notion of building it in pieces was always a poor approach to the project s politics and efficiency the original plan and amendment made by senator yee are sound los angeles to san francisco first then the extensions to san diego and sacramento as a guaranteed phase ii rome wasn t built in a day neither will high speed rail
2536101 the project root directory seems not to be under subversion control
2536102 having spent years responding to emergency situations where lives are in imminent danger it disturbs me to think that some individuals are purposely undermining emergency responses with their abuse of 911 lines
2536103 it is my hope that these stronger penalties will make people think twice before calling 911 with a non emergency
2536104 i consider it a privilege to recognize the efforts of these outstanding members of our community these men and women in law enforcement and fire protection our friends and family have dedicated their lives to providing safety and security for us and i am pleased to honor them and to give our community a chance to publicly acknowledge their contributions
2536105 safe streets and safe cities are a hallmark of life here in the inland empire and the credit for our secure communities goes to our public safety personnel
2536106 the august 15th ballgame at quakes stadium is more than just a baseball game its a chance for residents to show their appreciation to the brave men and women who selflessly place their lives on the line for us each and every day since being a member of the legislature i have had the privilege to meet and work with many public safety professionals and witness firsthand the outstanding job they do
2536107 the men and women we ll be honoring are on the front lines every day saving lives and protecting our communities
2536108 let s show them how much the community supports their efforts by filling the stands on first responders night this year
2536109 i have never enjoyed reading the bible as much as i did with that
2536110 i can see the images and understand the story better
2536111 one thing i found as a visual learner some of what i was reading was much easier to remember because of the format
2536112 its for people who know the bible but could benefit from a creative interpretation
2536113 it is also for those who dont know the bible stories it introduces them to the grand biblical narrative
2536114 if we are not addressing issues contemporaneously we should all just go home and hope for the best
2536115 on the other hand the authors of the bible were always ingeniously contemporary
2536116 did jesus dumb down the entire book of deuteronomy by his condensation of the law into a phrase
2536117 theres a lot of blood and guts and scorched earth
2536118 but as familiar as i am with jesus and his stories and teachings i never really had a grasp of the personality i never had any insight on the emotional aspect of jesus
2536119 hey boys go out and rape now while youre young in the worst case scenario youll spend three years in juvenile custody

2536122 it has more of a community feel rather than the bands are inaccessible and locked away
2536123 it doesnt have the air of like a sasquatchy thing
2536124 obviously there are many more than 40 that we would have liked to have
2536125 growing up in yakima the opportunity for shows being under 18 was few and far between
2536126 it might be way easier to do it 21 plus but whats the point
2536127 yakima gets skipped over a lot by bands so when it did happen i remember it being super special
2536128 those shows kind of blew a lot of our minds
2536129 they personally inspired me to get involved as a nonmusician
2536130 it will be a chance to do a meet and greet share the companys culture and for them to show off their facilities
2536131 i really think that he wanted to exceed the typical specs that the hotels throw out there
2536132 i am grateful for the opportunity to tell each and every one of you that i am proud of you
2536133 we pray that each and every one of you return safe to your families
2536134 i think most of us want to get over there and start the mission so we can get back home
2536135 customers shouldnt be paying high profit margins to investors investing in low risk investments that is not an appropriate place to do that
2536136 we are happy we could hold the line on that
2536137 its hard to sign off on a rate increase for low income people there is no good rate increase
2536138 at the same time these days it is inevitable the costs for utilities are going up
2536139 it avoids the prolonged and costly litigation of a full blown rate case proceeding
2536140 it potentially brings the change into effect a little sooner
2536141 she took his entire way of life when she finally determined to leave
2536142 i could never have asked for a better person to be with
2536143 you are my best friend as well as my lover you are the best thing that has ever happened to me
2536144 the bullet would have had to turn the corner so to speak
2536145 i got up to get my gun out of the closet because i was going to fire it the next day
2536146 in fact it was her normal practice to never be in the same room as that gun but now she was in the room with that gun and you pulled the trigger
2536147 they are being exposed to a cultural richness that they can call their own
2536148 each generation always has to leave to their descendants the teachings of their culture
2536149 the students later went on to do well in school i cant prove that it was due to the visit by the mexican teachers but i think their participation had a lot to do with it
2536150 my duty is to try to teach kids to really be happy to not follow the path to drugs or vandalism to live life in a positive way
2536151 each student has many gifts to use and many times they are used in a negative way
2536152 but he is right on with most of his reporting opinionating

2536177 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2536178 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2536179 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2536180 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2536181 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2536182 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2536183 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2536184 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2536185 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2536186 ladies and gentlemen sit down right now or you will be removed from this courtroom

2536200 they began to teach people about how changing their thinking was changing their lives
2536201 they never intended to start a church or spiritual community but thats what happened
2536202 id feel really lost if there wasnt a unity spiritual life center
2536203 unity encourages people to be themselves it encourages people to love and forgive one another

2536222 while the details of the long term maintenance and care are not clear it could be argued that this is a legitimate public expense to demolish the structure as a way to remove an obstacle to the reuse of the building

2536224 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
2536225 it is plain to me that you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty

2536232 teniendo en cuenta la experiencia del gobierno de fujimori es un peligro declarar secretas las compras militares

2536332 there was talk about sex offenders and so forth in the shelter downstairs
2536333 when i was 18 i was gang raped by four guys and when that happened to me i just have strong feelings that a sex offender needs heavy monitoring
2536334 for the purposes of the drop in shelter we dont screen guests that come in we serve 1 500 people for any given year and we cant do a criminal background check on anyone that comes in
2536335 we certainly dont pretend to supervise persons that are in the drop in shelter in terms of whether they stay there or leave or whether they enter or not or anything like that
2536336 sometimes they end up in short term housing locations and shelters as a temporary solution and this is much better than the alternative of having them walk the streets at night which is not good for anybody
2536337 we do work closely with the madison police department and they actually conduct a random verification checks on the registrants at that shelter
2536338 theyre not doing a thorough job like they need to do

2536379 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2536380 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2536381 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2536382 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too

2536384 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2536385 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc federal open market committee on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for dow jones industrials last week despite generally weak economic reports
2536386 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years

2536452 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2536453 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2536454 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2536455 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2536456 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2536457 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2536458 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2536459 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2536460 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2536461 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2536462 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2536463 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2536464 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2536465 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2536466 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2536467 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2536468 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2536469 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2536470 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2536471 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2536472 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2536473 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2536474 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2536475 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2536476 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2536477 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2536478 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2536479 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2536480 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2536481 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2536482 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2536483 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2536484 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2536485 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2536486 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2536487 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2536488 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2536489 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2536490 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2536491 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2536492 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2536493 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2536494 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2536495 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2536496 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2536497 look john mccains site has a game where you fight against pork
2536498 by wideload games is essentially a party game with well written electoral trappings
2536499 is a fairly deep simulation of what it takes to actually win an american election
2536500 see the player learns not to engage with the game at all
2536501 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2536502 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2536503 they expect people to know theology liturgy and the church seasons and be able to tie them together
2536504 planning for the arts in worship music and congregational music for the 21st century church
2536505 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2536506 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2536507 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2536508 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2536509 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2536510 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
2536511 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2536512 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2536513 i still thank those people for all their efforts ripping and uploading videos about us they are one of the reasons why we are here they have exposed us worldwide and that is something that i treasure so much i want to upload videos too but i dont know how and im afraid that i might get suspended too
2536514 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2536515 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2536516 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2536517 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2536518 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2536519 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2536520 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2536521 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2536522 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2536523 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2536743 they cannot believe that were christians because we have tattoos and ride motorcycles
2536744 an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2536745 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2536746 people like rumors they are going to say things like you know you was in the club with
2536747 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
2536748 its a movement of the people there is no leader there is no lecturing in our group we all go out together and we come together there is no leader nobody controls us its just the peoples movement
2536749 door to door we have done canvassing and people are coming out much beyond our control but see this is cause for everyone nobody is doing for one another we are doing for ourselves we want land and nothing short of land
2536750 decoupling financial aid from individual colleges altogether and creating other organizations whose goal is to allocate funding to students independently of the schools that they attend
2536751 donors who are currently giving to colleges without really knowing where their money is spent will be able to give with the goal of funding students all while having more transparency into how their contributions are actually being put to good use

2536754 hvis jeg ser p om sanktionerne har ledt til nogle fremskridt for civilbefolkningen i myanmar m jeg konstatere at det ikke er tilf ldet myanmar er isoleret og lukket set fra et udviklingsperspektiv kunne det v re relevant at rejse sp rgsm let om turisters adgang til myanmar
2536755 her er der ikke nogen tvivl om at hvis der kom flere turister til myanmar ville der ogs knyttes b nd imellem civilbefolkningen og andre dele af verden

2536758 es cierto que la comuntiat valenciana necesita m s recursos pero nunca para despilfarrar m s como ha hecho hasta ahora el gobierno valenciano
2536759 pasa obviamente por acabar con la pol tica de locura y despilfarro de la administraci n camps
2536760 la muestra de la mala gesti n del pp al frente de la generalitat con p rdidas de m s 184 millones de euros anuales en las empresas y fundaciones p blicas vinculadas a los grandes proyectos facturas en los cajones por casi 1 000 millones de euros y con un d ficit presupuestario de 223 millones de euros
2536761 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2536762 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2536763 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out

2536767 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts
2536768 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2536769 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2536770 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2536771 if we had it like this once a year ok
2536772 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2536773 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2536774 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2536775 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2536776 sea bandera internacional de progreso creaci n de empleo e impacto econ mico una pol tica tildada por los dirigentes socialistas de despilfarro
2536777 si despilfarro para los socialistas es que el consell duplique las cifras de gasto de los eventos internacionales en renta p blica qu nombre tiene la pol tica de rodr guez zapatero que invierte lo poco que queda en las arcas p blicas del estado en todo menos en actuaciones a largo plazo para paliar la crisis econ mica que vivimos en frenar el desempleo y en exigir que el ministerio de igualdad cumpla con su trabajo como reconocer a todos los espa oles por igual
2536778 la renta generada en la comunitat valenciana por la inversi n de un mill n de euros es de 978 840 euros
2536779 con este fin la apuesta que los gobiernos del partido popular han hecho por los grandes proyectos y eventos en nuestra tierra impulsa y consolida la proyecci n nacional e internacional de la comunitat
2536780 se ha convertido en una inversi n estrat gica del consell que se ha consolidado en el panorama audiovisual y que ha generado una inversi n directa en la comunitat de 85 millones de euros durante sus tres primeros a os de funcionamiento periodo en el que ha acogido el rodaje de un total de 26 producciones
2536781 asciende a 249 millones de euros y han supuesto unas 114 130 pernoctaciones en hoteles de diferentes municipios de la comunitat en este tiempo
2536782 m s de 40 5 millones de euros en ingresos 7 9 millones m s que en 200
2536783 4 2 millones de visitas y 204 millones de euros de gasto tur stico
2536784 frente a la ignorancia del gobierno de rodr guez zapatero a los cert menes internacionales que se han programado en nuestro territorio compar ndolo con el trato privilegiado que tienen los eventos en otras autonom as como la expo de zaragoza
2536785 no reconozcan la realidad de que los grandes proyectos y eventos que organiza el consell significan proyectar nuestro potencial nuestro atractivo y nuestra imagen de modernidad el dinamismo y la riqueza y que mostramos al mundo tal c mo somos y c mo vivimos e invitamos a todos a que vengan a conocernos

2536787 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2536788 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2536789 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2536790 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2536791 when i arrived to work at noon nothing had happened
2536792 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2536793 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2536794 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2536795 we couldnt ask for better results three american flags being raised
2536796 it was awesome standing up there and listening to our national anthem
2536797 it would have been like landing on the moon was perceived in the 1920s
2536798 before 2000 the idea that americans would take three olympic medals of any kind let alone in a sweep of one event was laughable
2536799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2536800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2536801 sir please put your hands above your head and spread your legs

2536805 not that thick crust shit that the chicago tourism board wants you to believe is chicago style
2536806 i came here to meet you so please ask away
2536807 radio buttons to respond without having to scroll to those buttons just bugs the hell out of me but i generally put up with it i guess i should learn to be more tolerant in other areas as well

2536810 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2536840 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2536841 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2536842 am redus capacitatea cu 3 1 fa de anul trecut

2536844 in training camp the door is open for players to make the team
2536845 when a player takes a year off you need to see how he recovers
2536846 we have talked about a contract but it makes sense for him to come to training camp for a tryout and then us talk about a contract
2536847 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2536848 sometimes i think about hitting my wife but i never have and probably never will
2536849 as soon as i get out of this interview im going to go beat my wife
2536850 i stole 100 of hardware from a store two months ago and ive repented but if i try to return it i could still be charged with theft
2536851 20 years ago a year before i joined the church i raped a woman and want to get this off my conscience ive never done anything even like it since
2536852 i think that if something can be dealt with in house and the problem resolved and stopped theres no need for the law to become involved providing all parties agree to that the offender and the offended
2536853 there will come a day when this amendment is applied by the us supreme court opening the way for gay marriage in much the same manner as they did for school desegregation
2536854 look no more boring tv shows this is the law you break it and well fine you
2536855 im a quasi libertarian but very much a libertarian when i hear about stuff like this make suggestions but dont limit my freedoms
2536856 if crappy talks in church are really the concern to me it would seem like a more appropriate approach would be to talk to the bishops who when calling people to talk could give them a short list of suggestions
2536857 yet at the same time if this is really a sacred space why are wailing infants allowed why are non members allowed and why are jokes allowed
2536858 also and this is really me just being annoying but the way you are describing
2536859 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination
2536860 the bible says its wrong we selectively choose to live by aspects of the bible that we like and this is one of them so its wrong
2536861 mormonism is and its leaders periodically do morally repugnant things
2536862 fear that what i disagree with will somehow take over the world and deny me the right to criticize
2536863 hmmm yeah those homosexuals they dont deserve equal rights lets treat them as second class citizens
2536864 undercutting their ability to take a moral stand in favor of heterosexual marriages and families and perhaps even the legal right to perform mixed sex marriages at some distant date
2536865 and as a result of my arguments above i think we should disallow religious groups from marrying their followers
2536866 you can dismiss anyones motivations for doing what they are doing as
2536867 somewhere deep inside the minds of the mormon leaders there is some type of insecurity and that is why they are doing what they are doing
2536868 everything bad is part of a fiendish plot by legions of satans followers to ensnare the righteous the world is getting ever more sinful and dangerous the world will become hell for the unrighteous before jesus comes again even the elect will be deceived be on your guard
2536869 the prophet of god is completely wrong on this issue
2536870 there is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind with nothing they can do about it from our premortal life we were directed into a physical body there is no mismatching of bodies and spirits boys are to become men masculine manly men ultimately to become husbands and fathers
2536871 how americans view mormonism seven steps to improve our image
2536872 averages do not manifest themselves in the lives of a particular couple
2536873 mormon leaders do their best to interpret gods will in determining religious doctrine and mormon policy but some times they get gods will wrong
2536874 and whoso shall declare more or less than this and establish it for my doctrine the same cometh of evil and is not built upon my rock
2536875 well divorce court is liars court you shouldnt expect honesty
2536876 the best change mormonism leaders members could make would be to give up a portion of mormonism and teach enforce basic christian concepts principles values as they do lds church practices
2536877 i was reading recently a book entitled roots of modern mormonism the author mark leone a sociologist had studied several wards in eastern arizona turning on mormon society a carefully unbiased eye leone said that mormonism has remarkably little firm doctrine that the variance of belief within the mormon church is very wide and that while mormons are convinced that they have the complete revealed truth from god in fact they have very few beliefs that are universally agreed upon
2536878 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2536879 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2536880 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2536881 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2536882 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2536883 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2536884 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2536885 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2536886 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2536887 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2536888 it might vaporize applications it might simply prevent them from using the gps global positioning system for all we know it could trigger world war three or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
2536889 well bring it up in counseling if you cant talk to daddy about it
2536890 there are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region and its very hard to withhold them from taking part a real war is going on
2536891 i want to reiterate on president bushs behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2536892 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2536893 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2536894 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2536895 the intense fighting in the south ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full fledged war
2536896 war would have a devastating impact for the entire region i urge the georgians south ossetians and russians to cease fire end military action and stop further escalation we need to pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2536897 we are monitoring developments we urge an immediate cease fire in the fighting in south ossetia and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties
2536898 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2536899 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2536900 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2536901 i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order
2536902 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2536903 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2536904 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2536905 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers
2536906 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2536907 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2536908 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2536909 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2536910 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2536911 the harder thing to do and the right thing to do are usually the same thing
2536912 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2536913 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2536914 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2536915 it was to the point where we didnt know what was going to happen to her
2536916 here there is someone i trust who i know who ive selected and who is committed that gives us hope that laylas future can be good
2536917 pln telah berulang kali membohongi masyarakat sumut untuk itu jangan terlalu mudah mempercayai janji pln untuk tidak melakukan pemadaman bergilir

2536919 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2536920 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2536921 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2536922 we weten niet wat er gaat gebeuren maar we praten er momenteel over de beslissing ligt bij president michail saakasjvili

2536937 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2536938 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2536939 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2536940 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2536941 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

2536943 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2536944 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2536945 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2536946 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2536947 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

2536963 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2536964 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2536965 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2536966 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2536967 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2536968 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2536969 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2536970 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2536971 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2536972 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2536973 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2536974 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2536975 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2536976 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2536977 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2536978 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2536979 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2536980 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2536981 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2536982 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2536983 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2536984 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2536985 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2536986 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2536987 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2536988 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2536989 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2536990 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2536991 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2536992 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2536993 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2536994 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2536995 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2536996 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2536997 just so you all know we did set a record
2536998 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2536999 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2537000 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2537001 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2537002 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2537003 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2537004 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2537005 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2537006 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2537007 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2537008 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2537009 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2537010 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2537011 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2537012 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2537013 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2537014 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2537015 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2537016 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2537017 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2537018 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2537019 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2537020 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2537021 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2537022 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2537023 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2537024 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2537025 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2537026 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2537027 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2537028 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2537029 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2537030 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2537031 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2537032 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2537033 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2537034 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2537035 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2537036 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2537037 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2537038 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2537039 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2537040 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2537041 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2537042 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2537043 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2537044 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2537045 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2537046 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2537047 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2537048 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2537049 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2537050 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2537051 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2537052 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2537053 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2537054 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2537055 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2537056 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2537057 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2537058 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2537059 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2537060 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2537061 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2537062 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2537063 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2537064 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2537065 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2537066 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2537067 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2537068 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2537069 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2537070 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2537071 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2537072 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2537073 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2537074 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2537075 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2537076 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2537077 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2537078 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2537079 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2537080 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2537081 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2537082 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2537083 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2537084 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2537085 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2537086 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2537087 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2537088 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2537089 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2537090 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2537091 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2537092 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2537093 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2537094 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2537095 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2537096 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy

2537154 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2537155 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2537156 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2537157 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2537158 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2537159 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2537160 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2537161 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2537162 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2537163 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2537164 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2537165 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2537166 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2537167 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2537168 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2537169 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2537170 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2537171 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2537172 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2537173 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2537174 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2537175 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2537176 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2537177 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2537178 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2537179 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2537180 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2537181 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2537182 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2537183 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2537184 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2537185 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2537186 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2537187 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2537188 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2537189 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2537190 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2537191 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2537192 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2537193 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2537194 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2537195 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2537196 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2537197 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2537198 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2537199 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2537200 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2537201 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2537202 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2537203 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2537204 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2537205 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2537206 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2537207 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2537208 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2537209 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2537210 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2537211 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2537212 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2537213 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2537214 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2537215 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2537216 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2537217 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2537218 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2537219 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2537220 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2537221 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2537222 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2537223 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2537224 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2537225 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2537226 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2537227 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2537228 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2537229 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2537230 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2537231 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2537232 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2537233 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2537234 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2537235 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2537236 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2537237 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2537238 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2537239 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2537240 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2537241 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2537242 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2537243 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2537244 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2537245 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2537246 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2537247 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2537248 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2537249 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2537250 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2537251 i have no knowledge when she will come it is not possible for foreign minister of a country to keep track of the movement of the individual who is our guest it is for them to decide
2537252 this much you know that our tradition is to give shelter to anybody who seeks shelter
2537253 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2537254 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2537255 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2537256 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2537257 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2537258 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2537259 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2537260 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2537261 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2537262 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2537263 it is a very good decision and definitely a victory for home schooling families in the state
2537264 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2537265 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2537266 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2537267 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2537268 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2537269 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2537270 the old testament describes idolatry as the work of human hands so if you worship the work of human hands the political system economics anything like that that is idolatry the consequence of idolatry according to the commandments is that the third and fourth generation suffer from their iniquity
2537271 a single parent is actually a contradiction in terms what youve actually got is an abandonment but youre not allowed to say that because it is usually the mum who is bringing up the child
2537272 the image of god that is what we were created in isnt it that is the basis of human dignity and if you deny that image in yourself you are denying the most precious thing if you say i am no more than the skin and bones youd have lost the most important thing of all i dont know if you have this in america but in magazines you have all this lets give you a new image you know and you have your hair dyed and plastic surgery and all the rest of it you dont need a new image you know weve got the greatest image already but most people dont know that you are the image of god and that defines your rights and your responsibilities
2537273 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2537274 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2537275 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2537276 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2537277 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2537278 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2537279 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2537280 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2537281 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2537282 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2537283 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2537284 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2537285 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2537286 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2537287 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2537288 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2537289 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2537290 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2537291 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2537292 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2537293 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2537294 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2537295 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2537301 it was just 90 hours i had to do but once i got my license i promised myself i would never make a commission on it and i never have
2537302 i talked to the realtor to make sure all papers were in line and i went with him to closing
2537303 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2537304 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2537305 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out

2537307 porque nadie hizo reservas ni previsiones paraguay puede incendiarse en menos de dos o tres meses
2537308 paraguay depende en un 100 del combustible del exterior y camino a posadas tuve una experiencia al intentar reabastecer mi veh culo en las afueras de asunci n no hab a gasoil
2537309 asumir el 15 de agosto sin medicamentos en los hospitales y sin gasoil es un pa s que se puede incendiar en menos de dos o tres meses hay escasa distribuci n nadie hizo reservas ni se hicieron las licitaciones para la provisi n de insumos de salud
2537310 el presidente electo no recibi toda la informaci n para tener una idea clara de c mo se maneja el tema gasoil
2537311 petropar entrega el combustible a camiones cisternas de empresas propietarias de estaciones de servicio gasolineras y ellas distribuyen a sus bocas de expendio digo enf ticamente que el pa s est abastecido para iniciar su periodo agr cola y transporte de productos agropecuarios
2537312 no es f cil administrar este rubro clave para la econom a y no temo ser investigado posteriormente por mi gesti n aqu no hay ninguna irregularidad las cr ticas tienen tinte pol tico porque la percepci n dice que todos los funcionarios p blicos somos presuntamente bandidos
2537313 el presidente lugo asumir el gobierno con una reserva nuestra de 20 millones de litros y adem s venezuela nos est enviando 70 millones de litros de gasoil a un costo de 70 millones de d lares para que el pa s no sufra inconvenientes
2537314 no queremos que en los pr ximos meses haya disturbios sociales como los hubo recientemente en la argentina planeamos un nuevo impuesto para la producci n de soja pero deseamos un acuerdo con los empresarios agr colas para evitar tumultos o alborotos

2537316 she calls the brothers and sisters her siblings and she has definitely been entrenched in their family shes one of them
2537317 theyve already told us that basically the programs over were hoping that maybe after the dust settles well get back and have the program
2537318 differences of understanding with regard to the manner in which it is to be exercised and also with regard to its scriptural and theological foundations
2537319 the countenance of the australian metropolis is being transformed for a week into the world capital of youth and not just catholic
2537320 it was an act of faith and courage of cardinal george pell and of the church in australia to invite young people worldwide to sydney
2537321 it was an act of faith and courage of the pope to accept
2537322 it is an act of faith and courage of the local churches to send their young people in the measure of their possibilities despite the cost and exhaustion of a long trip
2537323 however no place of the church is far away the spirit leads the disciples to proclaim the gospel to the ends of the earth and every place of the earth is at the center when the eucharist is celebrated there
2537324 if unable to be physically present in sydney will be there virtually and many and this is what is most important will be there spiritually united in prayer
2537325 young people of past world youth days are now adults and know up to what point this experience has been wonderful for their lives
2537326 todays young people tomorrows adults will also know that sydney is close and that hope and love in the churchs future and in that of the whole of humanity also depends on them
2537327 we remember the difficult beginnings our first attempts to organize the church community the first divine liturgy on easter 1998 which was celebrated by fr serge kelleher we thank you gratitude is the gesture of a religious person all that we have we have from god and also from others we thank this state which accepted the ukrainian immigrants the exarchate which opened the doors of the church of the holy trinity the ukrainian embassy priests who ministered and are ministering we hope that we will continue and develop our way one departs others come it happens in all of dimensions of human life
2537328 the grace of the lord jesus christ the love of god the father and the communion of the holy spirit be with you all
2537329 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
2537330 and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
2537331 syria is the cradle of christianity and the meeting place of civilizations
2537332 finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you greet one another with an holy kiss all the saints salute you the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen
2537333 dont say you dont have enough time you have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to helen keller pasteur michaelangelo mother teresa leonardo da vinci thomas jefferson and albert einstein
2537334 i think the key is if we explain to kids that a lot of stuff they do when theyre playing is really science
2537335 you dont have to think that youre not doing science until middle school and high school and then its all equations and its hard maybe if they grow up with it they wont be so daunted by science later
2537336 we marked how far the cars went and we put a blob of play doh on the car if its heavier does it go farther or not as far

2537346 im chesty of him because persuasion is dirty especially with republicans
2537347 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2537348 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2537349 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2537350 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2537351 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2537352 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2537353 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2537354 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2537355 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2537356 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2537357 sir please put your hands above your head and spread your legs
2537358 you are hauled off to jail where you are finger printed photographed asked a boat load of questions and given the old
2537359 working around here is like being in high school the politics are awful its like a bunch of kids for some of these people i love what i do but i dont know how much longer i can work here with this
2537360 how could something like this happen with the technologically advanced world that we live in
2537361 falei com alguns prefeitos e eles me dizem que pela falta de cimento n o conclu ram obras que os pre os subiram e essa queixa permanente
2537362 re did i do the right thing a little long i have a couple of questions firstly did your niece say anything did the girls lie to
2537363 re did i do the right thing a little long i need to understand if ds was telling the real reason why neice got hurt then why
2537364 re re did i do the right thing a little long ds is 8 niece is 5 he was punished because he knows better than to try to hurt her just
2537365 re did i do the right thing a little long if you are asking then you obviously dont feel comfortable with how you handled
2537366 why are we eating more calories now than we were in 1971
2537367 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2537368 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2537369 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2537370 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2537371 the negotiators from the three parties are engaged in consultations as we speak to try and tie loose ends before president mbeki arrives
2537372 all i can say for now is that they are working hard and i suppose things will go well
2537373 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it

2537587 no shit think how youd feel running up here while it wails
2537588 helps pass the time so it does you can guess what its like up here everyday looking after her it gets monotonous
2537589 just remember to keep your hands to yourself dont get her angry or get too close shes a trickster a liar and a murderer and it just so happens that the masters in love with her
2537590 they unlock the doors and lock them anti clockwise opens them clock wise closes them remember in her chamber they work for something more important and you must remember otherwise my girlie the master will have your pretty little head on his mantelpiece
2537591 now remember what i told you my pet watch her like a hawk do not get too close and above all do not get her angry here
2537592 but that wont be difficult pretty little thing like you shell think youre harmless like a little gnat
2537593 the master did that infatuated he was or is thinks shes the only one who can rival him naturally he had her locked away
2537594 youre not having second thoughts are you i mean i cant get you shipped out there
2537595 oh its so dark in here lets put some lights on
2537596 i do wish youd clean up after your pet mrs beckett the shit on the floor really is unsightly
2537597 sear is my eyes and ears when im not around he keeps our lady safe
2537598 dont be shy apparently i only bite if you get too close
2537599 an orphan the master was kind enough not to subject her to the void like so many i found her in the slums thought she was of polite mouth and gentle manner my lady shell remain in greylock now working with me
2537600 youll never get the chance to go across the water
2537601 its time for me to leave and allow you two to get better acquainted
2537602 could you open the curtains please i havent seen the outside in days
2537603 isnt it horrendous when such a sight can be considered wonderful
2537604 now dont mince words karen i only ask that you give me the truth so please answer my one and only most important question
2537605 you wouldnt believe how horrendous it is when youve got an itchy nose
2537606 too long youll have to enquire with the lovely mrs beckett shes as old as this tower perhaps more i dont know time looses meaning when youre imprisoned without a sentence do i scare you
2537607 i have another request if i may can you loosen the chains i wish to stand and feel the air on my face
2537608 my lady please youre going to get me in trouble
2537609 you can control those cant you i mean mrs beckett says theyre connected to you they show what youre feeling but they havent changed colour not once
2537610 because i i think personally that greylock is a cruel place you can only travel across the water if you pass selection if you attend greylock school and are chosen by the master but look at me i am smart im smarter than most of them down there but im still clinging to the gutter people like me well were just tossed to the void but my lady thats fine by me i want to go back i have friends there theyre my family
2537611 i was a student and i was sick to death of seeing my friends killed it was worse then
2537612 and so i took a stand and as a result of my efforts i got the most important person in my life killed
2537613 dont look at it greylock was being torn apart other people were being killed i wanted it to stop and i eventually handed myself over the master couldnt kill me because he loves me and nobody else could so he looked me up here putting mrs beckett as my jailer she got those scars because of me you know i got mine trying to save others from the explosions but it wasnt enough
2537614 they twist and pull and squeeze theyre knitted by the masters mother herself
2537615 she spends all day in her chair rocking back and forth knitting making sure ill never escape
2537616 im prepared to challenge the rest of the world for my revenge
2537617 she cant kill me but shes determined to break me
2537618 sear has gone to alert mrs beckett shell be up here soon
2537619 please my lady you need to get back in your chair
2537620 mrs beckett told me she picked me from the slums said that everyone had to pull their weight in greylock even the runts like me she told me the only way id be pardoned from my duties would be to kill the lady of chains
2537621 what so you thought i was just going to come here and what attack you
2537622 it makes all the difference look she knew you wouldnt kill me she knew you couldnt
2537623 get out of my way you horrible bucket of rust
2537624 im going to save you mrs beckett despises weakness she knows you cant kill me but if she thinks youve tried
2537625 youre lucky oh so very lucky that this isnt you
2537626 you wont kill her but maybe shell die in the crossfireeee
2537627 and i suppose youre bloody happy with yourself are you
2537628 i like to play games helps pass the time so it does now you might consider yourself higher up in the food chain but to me youre a challenge a puzzle
2537629 karen no no no its got nothing to do with her its all about you but truth be told i was hoping youd kill her we both know that you dont hope with death very well

2537645 earth science impact from the deep strangling heat and gases emanating from the earth and sea not asteroids most likely caused several ancient mass extinctions could the same killer greenhouse conditions build once again by peter d ward downloaded from http www sciam com article cfm articleid 00037a5d a938 150e a93883414b7f0000 amp sc i100322 most of the article omitted but with atmospheric carbon climbing at an annual rate of 2 ppm and expected to accelerate to 3 ppm levels could approach 900 ppm by the end of the next century and conditions that bring about the beginnings of ocean anoxia may be in place how soon after that could there be a new greenhouse extinction that is something our society should never find out
2537646 in the end permian as the levels of atmospheric oxygen fell and the levels of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide rose the upper levels of the oceans could have become rich in hydrogen sulfide catastrophically this would kill most of the oceanic plants and animals the hydrogen sulfide dispersing in the atmosphere would kill most terrestrial life

2537830 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2537831 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before

2537834 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2537835 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2537836 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2537837 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2537838 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2537846 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2537847 they mark dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2537848 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2537849 georgians are by nature extremely patriotic and this event has galvanized them together
2537850 it was as if georgia had won the world cup and was celebrating

2538027 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2538028 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2538029 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2538030 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2538031 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2538032 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2538033 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2538034 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear

2538036 this is the first nonstate radio broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949
2538037 we lost the battle for a boycott of the opening ceremony but that does not mean that we will keep quiet
2538038 we are protesting against the chinese governments failure to live up to the undertakings it made seven years ago when it made its bid to host the olympics
2538039 if we talk more about human rights in china today it is because of protests like this
2538040 its a complicated issue do we support our athletes whove worked so hard to get there or do we speak out against the place that doesnt really honor our freedom and achievements

2538046 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2538047 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2538048 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
2538049 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
2538050 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them
2538051 its sad to see mccains campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge promoting the fallacy that americans are powerless to address their own energy problems because the truth is yes we can
2538052 under the supremacy clause a california law attempting to preclude trustees and other assignees by operation of law from reaching a debtors cause of action but not exempting it from the reach of other judgment creditors
2538053 here congress has pervasively defined the exemptions that a state may permit a debtor to claim only in a bankruptcy case even if they are not generally exempt from creditors outside of bankruptcy those are the exemptions defined by bankruptcy code 522 d and congress further specified exactly how a state may make those bankruptcy specific exemptions available by not opting out pursuant to code 522 b 2 where congress has already defined both the substantive law and the procedure in a pervasive federal scheme that generally pre empts state legislation congress has occupied the field there simply is no room for states to adopt their own bankruptcy specific exemptions by a procedure other than that provided by the code i e not opting out of the bankruptcy codes exemptions

2538058 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2538059 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2538060 india whose nuclear cooperation with the united states is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2538061 it was a deadly weapon that has also afflicted survivors for the rest of their lives
2538062 we strongly believe there is credible evidence to show that
2538063 we are very disappointed by this and find it incredibly ironic that the same government that put the rifle in his hand is now seeking to up the ante because of his alleged use of that rifle
2538064 weve got to remember that everybody in fallujah had a rifle good guys and bad guys and to single out sgt nazario for the alleged use of that rifle in the charged offense really paints the picture of what the government seeks to do here

2538069 i had the pleasure of speaking with the 4th evicted houseguest from big brother today i apologize that the interview is going to read like a novel i got to ask 3 questions jessie really took over and i just tried to type fast enough hes a little rambly and seems very concerned about the amount of naps he took i did not realize that was an issue but he seems like a nice kid with genuine intentions to be a good guy plus hes from iowa woot woot go hawks
2538070 a few weeks ago i was lucky enough to find myself a primo spot in julie chens live audience for big brother it was an experience that was both massively entertaining and wildly surreal as soon as it was over i wanted to go back but i soon learned that contrary to what the shows staff says and encourages repeat visits are a no no with the ticketing company well i wasnt about to let some arbitrary bureaucratic decision by a third party hinder my big brother experience thats right my friends and i headed straight back to the cbs radford studio lot and plopped ourselves back in the bb audience it wasnt easy though and the chain of events that led to our seating verged on saga status but we made it and we were lucky enough to see one of the most amazingly idiotic exit interviews ever
2538071 jessie godderz eviction from big brother 10 can be blamed on america with the vote tied 3 3 it was dans vote that decided who would go home and as americas player he was required to go along with the will of the people and that was for jessie to go home

2538195 we are a nation that does not depend on writings and calculations to determine the beginning of the month
2538196 they ask you about the beginnings of the moons so tell them that they entail establishing for the people the time frames and establishing the time to perform pilgrimage
2538197 do not fast one or two days before ramadan start the month when you see the crescent and end it when you see the crescent if you are blocked from seeing it then complete thirty days of sha ban
2538198 i saw the crescent and told the prophet so he made the intention to fast and ordered the muslims to begin fasting ramadan
2538199 the best of the worshippers of allah are those who consider the sun the moon the stars and the shadows for prayer
2538200 the reward of every good deed is multiplied from ten up to seven hundred times however the reward of fasting done in sincerity will be multiplied by as many times as allah wills
2538201 when the month of ramadan starts the gates of the heaven are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the giants among the jinn are chained

2538203 the one who lives to the beginning of the month let him fast ramadan
2538204 islam is bearing witness that no one is god except allah and muhammad is the messenger of allah performing prayer paying zakah fasting the month of ramadan and performing hajj if one is able
2538205 ramadan pt 1 it is obligatory for the muslim to fast every day of ramadan with certain exceptions in sha allah these will be explained below

2538317 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2538318 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2538319 decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own i did this of my own volition without the instruction or suggestion of anyone and made a conscious decision not to tell anyone including john edwards that assistance was provided the assistance was offered and accepted without condition this is now and shall always remain a private matter between these individuals and me

2538445 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
2538446 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
2538447 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
2538448 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
2538449 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
2538450 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
2538451 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
2538452 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
2538453 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
2538454 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
2538455 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead superfund site toxins

2538516 i know it looks bad but i dont think its as bad as it looks
2538517 maybe ill be coughing a little bit later but i honestly dont feel the pollution it actually felt good once we got in the hills and it was overcast or whatever you call this
2538518 were professional cyclists so we go all over the world endure all kinds of conditions and were all dealing with the same thing
2538519 ive raced in some pretty nasty places ive raced in south america and central america where there are old cars are dripping oil on the road potholes in the pavement and dogs in the road were used to it this course here was on brand new pavement and it was beautiful

2538527 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2538528 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2538529 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2538530 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2538531 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2538532 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2538533 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2538534 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth

2538606 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2538607 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2538608 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2538609 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
2538610 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice
2538611 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
2538612 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure
2538613 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2538614 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2538615 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2538616 its an insane bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province
2538617 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2538618 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2538619 this issue is more than just adding ethanol into the gasoline we are aware of this practice and have already begun discussions with the idb inter american development bank to seek consultation on protocols in regards to using any sort of bio diesels along with petroleum products in the retail market and on the industrial side of the business
2538620 because it is one of the matters that have slowed up the process in approving bio diesel with petroleum products locally
2538621 today our price at the pump is based upon the invoice price where its imported we are looking at producing bio diesel locally
2538622 ethanol has the same effect on a number of vehicles for instance they would affect the silicone and rubber thats in the vehicles themselves and so thats why there is the concern of having those products in the retail market where someone pulls up to the pump and buys gas without an educational process taking place first
2538623 the government at this particular time is not looking at forcing any products upon consumers
2538624 the government at this time is looking at standards to be implemented for petroleum products
2538625 the motorists should not be concerned in my opinion because the government is taking steps to try and prevent a future incident
2538626 we have reviewed that policy and are considering those initiatives but before those initiatives come into place there must be a public awareness program in regards to the requirements to use this particular product
2538627 what is important is that we as a country ensure and put in place programs to address product quality and products that are imported into our country particularly in the petroleum industry and ensure that those standards are upheld
2538628 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

2538760 if id known i was going to live this long id have taken better care of my teeth
2538761 to assume makes an ass out of u and me
2538762 this townhouse in the strip strangler was how should i says this sparely populated
2538763 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2538764 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2538765 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2538766 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2538767 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2538768 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2538769 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2538770 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2538771 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2538772 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2538773 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2538774 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2538775 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2538776 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2538777 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2538778 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2538779 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2538780 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2538781 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management
2538782 molinas was a perfect player and by that i mean he wasnt a specialist he could handle and pass play defense if he wanted to and reobound if a crowd if he wanted to he had an assortment of head fakes and ball fakes he was a savvy player with great timing and his extra edge was his phenomenal hook shot the best hook shot ever there was nothing jacki molinas couldnt do on a basketball court
2538783 flate out jack molinas was one of the greatest players to ever play the game of basketball
2538784 living in the camden and trenton areas of new jersey he and former 76ers guard earl harrison are trying to start a basketball skills coaching clinic
2538785 we can get to the front of the gate they cant stop us
2538786 you need to struggle from all of europe it is one world and we should all fight to keep it beautiful
2538787 with all the talk of carbon footprints and wind and solar energy we just cant see why they should be allowed to burn fossil fuel leave the coal in the ground

2538795 thats the thing about covering john mccain someone always wants you to give him the benefit of the doubt
2538796 i think its the same with hurricanes and with severe thunderstorms and tornadoes
2538797 its just kind of this fascination for the incredible awe the power its so much greater than anything we as humans produce and theres nothing you can do about it it overpowers you
2538798 id rank hannah up there among the great blizzards because of the incredible amount of hardship that it caused
2538799 i think thats as good a way to rank blizzards as any
2538800 in the last 30 years hannah is probably the most intense storm that weve had but from the standpoint of blizzards of the century historically speaking id barely put it in the top four
2538801 was clearly the winner we have not seen a repeat of that storm environment in 40 years
2538802 the winds were between 40 and 50 mph most of the time the blizzard was going on it was about 20 below
2538803 when we start looking at particulars our memory tends to inflate things especially as we get older
2538804 if you ever get caught in a storm thats going to be the one that you remember whatever youre doing when it hits you remember
2538805 blizzards are kind of the forgotten stepchild in the weather world unless theyre occurring on the east coast its almost as if the country isnt aware of them
2538806 people say pasta is so boring it s not boring if you think it is boring then you dont understand pasta if you dont understand pasta you dont understand the culture
2538807 eh d do you remember the last wedding we went to together
2538808 oh actually one of my colleague was interested in you he finds you cute
2538809 laaaa apasal tak bagitau hari tu boleh la i buat macam cerita filem jumpa kat kenduri kawin orang jatuh cinta then kawin goshhh
2538810 well i think you wont be interested hes younger than us
2538811 block hiked back to the city but wasnt doing well
2538812 we have a 1930s teletype model of representation in the 21st century world you can google almost anything but then you call your local union office and you have to push 1 or 2 and then you cant find someone who speaks the language you speak
2538813 during 2008 and 2009 we will work together to evaluate test and pilot member resource centers mrcs we will determine the most effective and efficient manner in which to implement mrcs and to provide high quality member representation across the union
2538814 by 2012 a majority of members will have 24 7 access to quality information and services from member resource centers mrcs will meet union wide standards for cost quality of service to members ease of access multiple language capability support available to member leaders and staff and quality of data to support seiu programs and strategies
2538815 are you tired of talking to machines leaving voice mail messages getting put on hold visit the mrc exhibit to find out how seiu locals can improve member service and support stewards and other member activists
2538816 the union of the future membership action and leadership to win for working people
2538817 a world leader in innovation and design known for working on products such as the macintosh mouse and the palm pilot
2538818 the combined effect of the conservative attack was that many unions lost half their membership within a very short time period
2538819 a central location for critical information and to file grievances
2538820 be serving more than 200 000 members from california locals 221 721 521 and 1021
2538821 i never dreamed id see my own union imitate credit card companies the irs and major insurers and try to turn us into dial a union having a union is supposed to help us stand up to management not just give us the ability to pick up a phone and call a 1 800 number a union is not about long distance representation from someone whos never set foot in your work place who doesnt know you or your manager and who doesnt have any understanding of what goes on where you work
2538822 this resolution 204 is being forced down our throat were going to get call centers whether they work or not
2538823 cwa like most unions was organized on the basis of member involvement fundamentally a unions power at any point in time is nothing more than the total energy and support of its members who can be mobilized
2538824 the basic premise of mobilization is that we must return to our roots and commit to a strategy that rests on increasing our power through membership education and involvement we have become too reliant on the crafty union negotiator the clever chief steward and the experienced local president to solve our problems we can no longer solely rely on grievances arbitrations or labor laws to achieve workplace justice
2538825 dont call the local when you have a problem go to your steward first
2538826 the most radical development from the seiu convention is that delegates overwhelmingly voted to commit seiu to changing the world not just their worksites
2538827 home care locals in california washington oregon and illinois in an industry without common worksites
2538828 organizing the largest contract action team ever in the commercial janitorial division
2538829 shift its staff focus from two thirds representation to two thirds union building
2538830 but all in all call centers have been effective at some locals in freeing up some time for field reps and stewards to do more pro active big picture work
2538831 as it is implemented at local 1 and planned in california the mrc is to answer basic questions determine if there is a possible grievance etc the point is to take some of the workload off the field reps and give them more time for actual organizing there will still be field reps out doing steward development issue organizing and there will still be a field rep for handling grievances disciplinary cases etc and both will still work with stewards the call center people will even have the contact info of stewards and what level of training they have and will refer some cases directly to those stewards
2538832 focus on building the union identifying and developing leaders organizing around workplace issues fighting for better contracts uniting more workers and winning politically and in the community
2538833 enable uhw to be more efficient and effective increase member confidence and loyalty achieve a more consistent level of representation
2538834 a very good job of explaining how these call centers will operate
2538835 there has been much consternation about seius proposal to handle workplace and union issues
2538836 about 100 food service workers at santa clara and stanford universities were moved two years ago from an seiu local 715 to the new service workers united they were not given the chance to vote on the move and later didnt know whom to go to for help kvitky said
2538837 they were told to call an 800 number that would connect them to an official at the new organizations offices back east
2538838 all of their issues are supposed to be handled through a national call center
2538839 theres no way a call center is going to help these people its the closest thing ive seen in the labor movement to a company union
2538840 seiu is headed toward becoming an aarp or sierra club type organization where members get an 800 number to call and a list of benefits this model is antithetical to building a real grassroots bottom up movement
2538841 a statewide master contract with 20 000 other university of california employees that gives them better wages and benefits and most importantly greater power
2538842 strategy of pressuring the university to kick aramark off campus and let these workers join local 3299 as direct uc employees
2538843 were becoming spectators in our own union passive consumers of the union product and thats a serious problem
2538844 we can give them strikers coffee and donuts for one day
2538845 i felt the whole thing was a slap in the face
2538846 as stewards weve taken classes learned to empower ourselves and helped our co workers exercise their rights in the workplace
2538847 many of us feel that the call center system will depersonalize the union and remove the face to face trust gained while organizing and representing members on the job we have grown our members union loyalty and gained their confidence while standing with them during the worst times at their jobs
2538848 seiu doesnt have a good history of day to day representation of handling the problems that we as stewards and local officers have to deal with a lot of our longtime leaders have gotten frustrated and walked away
2538849 members need to be more engaged and they should be the ones organizing other state workers while the staff should be doing professional representation work and mentoring stewards on how to write effective grievances
2538850 were not teaching enough of them how to write grievances
2538851 who never had a real job and dont know anything about labor
2538852 i dont have anything against young people but a lot of them are getting a big check now so their attitude toward grajeda is whatever you want me to do boss when youre speaking with someone on the telephone its just too easy for them to say you dont have a grievance and thats the end of the story
2538853 there are accountability issues in that kind of arrangement in the former local 347 the staff was accountable to the member elected executive board if a staff member wasnt cutting it the board could fire him her and also approve his her replacement thats obviously not the case now there is no evidence that our los angeles city employee worksites are stronger or better off than before the merger of local 347 into 721
2538854 encourages co workers to come to them because they are known respected and trusted with call centers you take away that face to face connection
2538855 if they have to pick up a phone and call an 800 number particularly in a discharge situation that to me is not a union if a member calls me or comes to my desk theyre going to say get back to me if you call someone on the phone in this big call center system it will be very easy for your message to get lost and your call not returned at kaiser where i work we would get so much push back on such an idea
2538856 were not against new ideas for being more innovative and effective as long as they work
2538857 throughout seius history we have learned that powerful unions require trained and effective workplace leaders strong shop floor organization and a culture of solidarity and action among members
2538858 to dispense with workplace conflict administratively and re construct the union as an issue advocacy organization to pursue priorities and execute campaigns in which workers would have little say
2538859 seiu should displace its employer relations work from the center of its membership activity outsourcing worksite grievances to call centers and other employer relations matters to top union officials
2538860 abandon the core purpose of the union in favor of using the employment nexus as an efficient means of securing dues check off mailing lists phone lists and e mails and a voter file
2538861 become the biggest strongest and best funded issue advocacy organization in america without worrying any longer about being an organization of workers by workers and for workers
2538862 the union of the future membership action and leadership to win for working people

2538884 we will introduce a licence and the basis of this will still remain the passport
2538885 for us passport is the official identity form our records are based on passports but in the future if we see that new passports are different from the records we have we will be forced to take action
2538886 as long as the gymnasts age is the same as in the passport there is no reason for the fig to take any action
2538887 fig has no doubts about any age problems we will not make any investigations for the time being
2538888 when i wake up in the morning in the bus and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2538889 i want to win on a road course and this is the last chance i have this year to do it
2538890 some other drivers bring a little more to the road courses than jimmie
2538891 some drivers have a better feel for the cup cars on a road course
2538892 its about trying to have more repetition and just do it more and make decisions and me drive the car and that s what this nationwide effort is all about just repetition
2538893 its not something big we have all the tools its just something small that is going to add up and be what we need
2538894 at the top level of racing where we are today that little bit of indecision is probably what s hurting us
2538895 i seem to have the pace for a lap or for a handful of laps doing the right things
2538896 but as the tires age i lose a little bit more time than i need to im not sure if its being over aggressive or what that really is i keep searching for it
2538897 i never thought i would win at richmond but i finally conquered that track
2538898 its one of those things we havent done to date
2538899 i think every great driver wants to be very diverse and be able to feel like they can win at every track that they go to
2538900 i know that hes johnson an awesome driver and he proves it every weekend i feel like its just a matter time more than anything i do think jimmies one of the greats out there
2538901 this is my first title and i hope its the first of many
2538902 for me torres has just got to be about the best striker in the world at the moment
2538903 he will get better this season which is great for liverpool and has got to be a worry for the rest of the division
2538904 i am looking forward to playing alongside him of course i am
2538905 attention to difficulty has increased too much id like for gymnastics to remain artistic
2538906 apparently he was just holding the ring badly and we are just praying that he is okay because we really need him for the team final
2538907 i havent seen him yet but others are saying he seems okay
2538908 we were just out there making laps until the end of the race

2539076 i will expel the jews and christians from the arabian peninsula and will not leave any but muslim
2539077 all religions other than islam are heresy and error therefore religion necessitates the prohibition of unbelief and this requires the prohibition of worshiping allah in any way other than that of the islamic sharia

2539081 i was running up the midfield and i snuck inside without anybody marking me
2539082 kwame made a great pass and all i had to do was put the ball in the goal we did a great job of playing to each others strengths on that play and it was really good for our team to jump right back on them after they scored we couldnt afford to let them sit back on us so that was a big goal
2539083 its a battle each time we play each other so we know what to expect
2539084 we had our chances at the end and i feel like we had their backs against the wall but couldnt get the ball in the net
2539085 we have another match tomorrow and weve been through this before on the road we just need to focus on the mental aspect of the game because we have the ability to get it done well rest up tonight and head into wilmington looking to take care of business
2539086 scott has been up there two days now when he was last seen he was near death after just two hours in the storm so theres no way he could still be alive
2539087 the proper thing to do is to move his body away from the main route possibly to a crevasse that will serve as the burial site
2539088 she was in great condition and i was not too worried i was sure she would come home
2539089 he said hey look dont worry about me the man knew that there was an expedition a rescue launched for him
2539090 various other people in the expedition teams who had two way radio were encouraging him talking to him and it seemed like he was in reasonably good spirits
2539091 neal beidleman said it looked they had sat down to wait out the storm at about the same time the rest of the team realized they would have to spend the night out they must have been in an exposed area or the shared heat from two bodies was not enough
2539092 they had to choose between the two and they took the one that might live
2539093 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2539094 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2539095 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
2539096 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
2539097 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them

2539102 from an owners perspective you can run a truck on about half of what you can run a nationwide budget on maybe a little less than that actually
2539103 for the manufacturers trucks make sense just for the fact that they sell more trucks than they do anything else
2539104 weve been fortunate to make it make sense and be a part of the series and look forward to being a part of the series for a while to come i think theres a lot of things in motion for the nationwide series to take place as we go forward and i think collectively as owners nascar everybody is working in the same direction to make that better
2539105 heres where it gets confusing because overall turnout was high the percent of the youth vote was almost the same as 2000 but percentages can hide as much as they reveal in figures used by circle the youth vote in 2000 made up 16 4 percent of the total translating to about 16 2 million votes in 2004 the the youth vote made up 18 4 percent translating to about 20 9 million votes thats a jump of 4 6 million says circle and a jump in overall turnout too more than 51 percent of citizens ages 18 to 29 voted in 2000 it was 42 3 percent
2539106 even the credit celebrities get for attracting new voters may be negligible for all of p diddys vote or die rhetoric targeting the youth vote only 17 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 actually went to the polls this year the same percentage as in 2000

2539114 we have adopted a comprehensive anti terror strategy that not only focuses on the security side but also includes preventing financing of terrorism and dealing with its intellectual roots as well as rehabilitating the followers of deviant ideologies after giving them counseling
2539115 assert that unbelievers such as christians jews and muslims who do not share wahhabi beliefs and practices are hated enemies global jihad as an effort to wage war against the unbelievers is also promoted lessons remain that jews and christians are apes and swine jews conspire to gain sole control over the world the christian crusades never ended the american universities of cairo and beirut are part of the continuing crusades the protocols of the elders of zion are historical fact and on judgment day the rocks or the trees will call out to muslims to kill the jews

2539138 on racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related forms of intolerance
2539139 the special rapporteur invites the council in measures adopted to combat racism and discrimination to take fully into account the increasing intertwining of race ethnicity culture and religion that characterizes the current political and ideological context
2539140 the growth of incitement to racial and religious hatred and the resurgence of manifestations of anti semitism christianophobia and more particularly islamophobia can be attributed to the following conflation of race culture and religion and the supervisory and security based approach to the practice and teaching of islam
2539141 throughout his term of office the special rapporteur has highlighted one of the central causes of the resurgence of racism and its increasing complexity the conflation of racial cultural and religious factors
2539142 our enemy doesnt follow the great traditions of islam theyve hijacked a great religion
2539143 exhorted the officials in these countries to assume their inherent legal responsibilities in order to stem this illegal trend in conformity with international and domestic laws which prohibit discrimination based on incitement to hatred towards individuals or groups because of their religion race or other grounds
2539144 in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked
2539145 we have established an oic group in washington d c with the aim of playing a more active role in engaging american policy makers
2539146 omg not you of all people it has to be you are you ok
2539147 what are they not telling me what do they see that is making the move so quickly
2539148 father antonias who was there said that many disparaging words were hurled against christianity by the muslim assailants during their rampage which incidentally included the destruction of altars and torching of bibles
2539149 the attackers shouted allah akbar and kill the infidels as they hurled stones at their christian neighbors homes
2539150 on racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related forms of intolerance
2539151 a party is being held at the grave of a 7 7 bomber in what is being seen as an insult to the 52 london commuters murdered three years ago today
2539152 the family of shehzad tanweer and 400 guests will celebrate his life and remember him as a martyr at a village in pakistan
2539153 tanweer 22 along with mohammad sidique khan 30 hasib hussain 18 and 19 year old jermaine lindsay died when they detonated rucksack bombs on three crowded tube trains and a no 30 bus
2539154 most muslims would be absolutely horrified as i am that shehzad tanweer is being remembered by some people as a martyr
2539155 on racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related forms of intolerance
2539156 a certain segment has basically been feeding a kind of xenophobia theres a reason why hate crimes against hispanic people doubled last year if you have people like lou dobbs and rush limbaugh ginning things up its not surprising that would happen
2539157 there is a consequence to the demagoguery over immigration hate crimes against latinos have gone way up over the last year weve also seen over the last several months this epidemic of nooses being hung all across the country since the events down in jena louisiana so what can we do to strengthen the enforcement of hate crimes legislation it is something that i will prioritize as president but i dont want to have to wait until i am
2539158 from the day i take office as president america will have a justice department that is truly dedicated to the work it began in the days after little rock i will rid the department of ideologues and political cronies and for the first time in eight years the civil rights division will actually be staffed with civil rights lawyers who prosecute civil rights violations and employment discrimination and hate crimes
2539159 the ideological dimension of islamophobia is directly connected to its intellectual legitimization as currently reflected in a number of so called intellectuals and political and social commentators that put forward openly islamophobic statements including explicit defamation of islam in particular one may note that a number of islamophobic statements have been falsely claimed to be scientific or scholarly in order to give intellectual clout to arguments that link islam to violence and terrorism furthermore the manipulation and selective quoting of sacred texts in particular the koran as a means to deceptively argue that these texts show the violent nature of islam has become current practice
2539160 the main challenge is now to define the threshold for legitimately restricting freedom of expression in order to protect the victims
2539161 perhaps because like other people in the resistance i fought back
2539162 mere condemnation or distancing from the acts of the perpetrators of islamophobia will not resolve the issue as long as they remain free to carry on with their campaign of incitement and provocation on the plea of freedom of expression
2539163 very right to vigorously condemn the publication of the cartoons and to seek to
2539164 muslim societies all over the world will be insulted therefore its a terrorist act
2539165 amend laws regarding freedom of expression in order to prevent offensive incidents such as the printing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet muhammad peace be upon him and the production of an anti islam film by a dutch legislator
2539166 the recent attack on the danish embassy in pakistan could be a reaction against the blasphemous campaign
2539167 if such acts against islam are not controlled more attacks on the eu diplomatic missions abroad could not be ruled out
2539168 let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
2539169 shows a terrorist who commits violence in the prophets name
2539170 dont forget that there are many norwegian companies in pakistan
2539171 haq did not mention to psychiatrists the notion that he was being controlled by voices or by god until many months after the shootings
2539172 this is a hostage situation and i want these jews to get out

2539176 we are far closer to restrictions on free speech than most people realize with even the times quoting learned analysts in favor of such restrictions
2539177 true statements about islam and jihad will be suppressed and precisely as islamic supremacists are pressing forward as never before with their program of stealth jihad against the west
2539178 on contemporary forms of racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance
2539179 is working on restricting free speech and american muslims are helping him
2539180 trivialization of racism and xenophobia particularly through its use as a political tool
2539181 ethical psychological and political conditions that have directly contributed to the increase in incitement to racial and religious hatred
2539182 the ideological context is characterized by the emergence of rhetoric based on the notion of a conflict of civilizations and religions as reflected in the discourse of certain political intellectual and media elites
2539183 the main challenge is now to define the threshold for legitimately restricting freedom of expression in order to protect the victims
2539184 strengthening the complementarity of freedom of expression freedom of religion and belief and the discouragement of racial ethnic or religious hatred

2539213 supporting a football team is not entirely or not only a seeking out of disappointment it is more a willingness to risk being disappointed but even this is not a straightforward thing the deal is not that you are happy being disappointed because it is so agreeable when the team wins it is rather the acceptance that pain and pleasure are integral to the key matter and that is love you dont love anything or anyone for the pain or the pleasure you love for the love of loving and that is an inextricable aspect of the passionate and committed support of a football team

2539310 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
2539311 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
2539312 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

2539322 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
2539323 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
2539324 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
2539325 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
2539326 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar

2539329 the remaining designers take on the next challenge on their way to winning 100 000
2539330 with about 150 swimmers on the team its the biggest team ever by about 20 kids so for us thats really our definition of success
2539331 weve had a good year in terms of winning and losing but having all these kids get out of bed early to come and swim is whats most impressive
2539332 last year we competed under section b and won which allowed us to move up to a more elite section weve done really well and were very pleased
2539333 i know some of the swimmers have gotten hold of his email address and theyve sent him an email or have asked for his autograph theyll be watching him on tv and itll be cool to be able to say that he came to westmount
2539334 for us its really exciting to see so many kids come out and join since swimming is a tough sport and usually involves chasing walls and doing laps
2539335 weve tried to implement more of a team spirit this year its really been about building a sense of community so that the kids come out and have fun with their friends
2539336 i realized that i had retired about five years too early
2539337 i believe that i have identified the right opportunity with the right company and the right partner in which to invest a part of my future
2539338 i am working very hard to learn the business because it is very different from what ive done in the past
2539339 i have always found it important and satisfying to balance my corporate aspirations with community service
2539340 i would like to professionalize and standardize processes and explore new directions towards areas of potential client services not yet attempted
2539341 we will be looking at traditional and non traditional venues such as airports university campuses and hotels for our expansion
2539342 we are also convinced that using our centers as mini offices for corporate sales reps and as distribution hubs for e commerce and catalogue companies have strong appeal
2539343 these images describe a type of going through the gate a moment connecting an ending and a beginning a point of anticipation excitement and sadness a departure and a personal moment shared
2539344 i can be carrying around a photograph of something for years thinking about how i want to do the painting
2539345 it doesnt really matter what you look at if it stirs you in some way thats what really can inspire you to work
2539346 i think our inspirations come from that kind of awareness that something touches you whether its a rock or a tree or an expression on a persons face
2539347 ill stand behind you and be waiting for you wherever you go an d for as long as it takes you to come home
2539348 you selfish son of a bitch youre more worried about a bunch of stupid men than you are about our 3 children ho w dare you expect me to accept this kind of mental anguish
2539349 just the whole package was determined not to be in our districts best interest
2539350 i think they have a different vision over there and we didnt fit in

2539352 it is an honor to be appointed as the new city administrator for the city of huntington beach
2539353 i am looking forward to working with the mayor and city council city employees and partners in the community to help implement the citys priorities and strategic goals
2539354 the city of huntington beach is fortunate to be able to recruit such a highly experienced administrator such as fred wilson
2539355 his background and management style will certainly complement our organization and help us to move forward toward our goals
2539356 i think what i bring to the table is a long career in public administration
2539357 the issues are going to be different because san bernardino is in the inland empire and huntington beach is a coastal city
2539358 if they end under 200 usd im letting bidders know i may refuse to sell them the shoes

2539360 because what we did was take a great game gears of war 1 for xbox 360 made it run at higher resolutions and added three new hours of really good gameplay and it got lower reviews i think that s bullshit and i don t understand it i can t figure out what it is
2539361 the progression has to be manifested in a new direction in policies and legislation
2539362 im hoping that he is able to make a dent in that direction with the office of the presidency

2539367 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
2539368 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
2539369 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
2539370 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
2539371 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
2539372 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
2539373 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
2539374 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
2539375 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
2539376 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
2539377 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year

2539384 for the church it is a question not only of preaching the gospel in ever wider geographic areas or to ever greater numbers of people but also of affecting and as it were upsetting through the power of the gospel mankinds criteria of judgment determining values points of interest lines of thought sources of inspiration and models of life which are in contrast with the word of god and the plan of salvation

2539418 foxes have a very high level of productivity there are 240 000 adult foxes in britain and these produce 425 000 cubs each year so if fox numbers are to remain constant there needs to be 64 mortality each year
2539419 there was no difference in the pattern of change in fox abundance between areas within or outside a hunt country the ban on hunting had no impact on fox numbers in britain
2539420 bound to cause extreme fear and distress in the hunted animal
2539421 hunting lifts me out of my modernist solitude and throws me down in a pre modern herd a composite herd made up of horse and hound and human each sharing its gift of excitement and giving its all to the tribe

2539474 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2539475 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated

2539485 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2539486 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2539487 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2539488 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2539489 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2539490 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2539491 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2539492 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2539493 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2539494 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2539495 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2539496 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2539497 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2539498 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2539499 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2539500 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2539501 i stand by my convictions and if they want to send me to jail for what i believe in then so be it

2539503 the only problem might have been if the bulldogs had asked for a release letter but there has been no release letter asked for at all
2539504 if there is no request for an exit letter there is no recognition of a former contract
2539505 hes signed his contract with toulon hes played a game and hes with us
2539506 he has decided to stop playing rugby league and start playing the 15 a side game to realise a new dream of playing for the all blacks and learning about rugby union with toulon coach and ex all blacks captain tana umaga
2539507 hopefully people come away with a taste of what the actual experience is
2539508 there was never any agenda there to glorify anything just to reflect the reality
2539509 its in the shoes of one person an average prisoner who is not a mastermind not a gang leader but someone who knowingly did something bad and didnt realise the consequences
2539510 that his girlfriend became pregnant was just a small subplot
2539511 i think it did effect him but so does hoping that youre going to get a full breakfast
2539512 basically these guys are sardines in a sardine can stuck together
2539513 there are no real happy smiles possessions are going missing people are getting laid out prison guards generally keep an eye on things but that doesnt mean they always do
2539514 the macho side comes out but the camera doesnt move and the guys get more and more honest
2539515 they were up front that they received drugs but then after all that talk they said there was something they hated about prison and that was missing their families
2539516 you see someone working hard to rehabilitate but theres no connection and theres little engagement
2539517 my lasting impression was of going into a place which has a choice to either lock away the prisoner or rehabilitate the prisoner
2539518 in this system weve chosen to lock away the prisoner
2539519 i think there are a lot of people in prison who are impressionable and could be changed but are not
2539520 officials told us if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
2539521 we have to have a good olympics otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2539522 the easiest thing for youths to do at the moment is to actually join a gang the hardest thing is to stay out of gangs
2539523 there is a real gap in the system and we are aiming to fill that gap and consult with at risk youth and their families about providing the best possible future for these kids
2539524 its about reconnecting our young people to culture and replacing the american influence we bring them under the indigenous umbrella of our marae and we remove their old lives and break the walls down
2539525 at the end we ask them to hang their bandanna on the pole and leave their colours at the door
2539526 there comes a point in time when youre sitting in jail that its time to move on
2539527 it was my second decent prison term but i had been in and out of remand custody many times being in jail was a badge of honour
2539528 i decided while i was in there that i needed different challenges and i found that in education
2539529 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2539530 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2539531 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2539532 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2539533 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2539534 i just found my way to this great site by searching for
2539535 with respect to kiwibank i shouldnt have made the comments i made national has had no discussions about kiwibank and has no plans to sell it
2539536 i think his paranoia is getting to him ive got no knowledge of where the tape came from
2539537 its dirty and quite frankly its probably illegal but the question is can we justify wasting the courts time with this were between a rock and a hard place
2539538 as i understand it if a person is a party to a conversation its not an offence under the crimes act for them to secretly tape the conversation
2539539 that was a high risk strategy even allowing for the sophistication of the attempt on which the crown relies that inevitably would have attracted attention at the border
2539540 it was a sustained effort the substance you imported was very considerable
2539541 manufacture was on a commercial scale with a high yield
2539542 it is well established that paraplegia can be the basis for a credit on the basis an otherwise proper sentence would be disproportionately severe as you have found already it renders you vulnerable in a prison environment
2539543 without a doubt that is our aim were confident we know we can do it
2539544 im looking forward to it i want to play them
2539545 while i was in the spinal unit the wheelblacks where training and playing in christchurch so i went and watched and got to have a go
2539546 weve done all the hard work so from here on in its just about fine tuning and trying to keep fresh fit and healthy
2539547 im actually looking forward to a bit of time off i havent had an off season for a few years now because ive played over in the united states as well
2539548 council and police have to go through a lengthy and expensive process simply to get a known gang headquarters to take down their intimidating fences knowing theres a possibility they could just move house and wed have to go through the process all over again
2539549 we all know youre never going to completely eradicate gangs but surely there should be more control on how we can deal with them
2539550 i think it reinforces the fact that arguments against extradition had no merit and that he is continuing to avoid the inevitable
2539551 it is a very significant intrusion case because it reinforces the fact that a lone individual who is motivated can cause significant damage to the military preparedness of this country
2539552 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
2539553 it would show him to be much more deliberate methodical and vindictive than otherwise
2539554 i would imagine that the government is going to try to show that hes not this eccentric but that he is using that as his cover story where his real motivation is attacking the government and the military because of us policies
2539555 the government through mckinnons admissions is halfway to the goal line but still has a ways to go
2539556 israel backs georgia in caspian oil pipeline battle with russia

2539558 my house is my castle and i want to finish my week trimming my lawn
2539559 mr hsu had started the lawnmower and the whole place got very emotional
2539560 i heard one of the people say well get this so and so
2539561 when i approached him i stood outside the gate and i called out to john come on john this is not the right thing to do
2539562 he bent down where the lawn mower was picked up a round pole and just charged at me screaming like a lunatic he crouched down in a martial arts position with his arms and the pole behind his shoulder
2539563 i got whacked around the thigh whacked over the back and then the stick broke and i pushed him away
2539564 he went running to his garage and came back with an iron running at me with an iron rake and i thought this has got out of control and i just stood outside the gate thinking this is crazy
2539565 it does not follow drawing a conclusion from irrelevant evidence
2539566 if a non muslim extends the salaam to you say wa alaykum
2539567 if the people of the book extend the salaam to you say wa alaykum
2539568 people dont know what it is so they equate it with hyper sexuality violence and drug culture
2539569 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend

2539591 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2539592 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2539593 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2539594 i think most people today know this is just a story
2539595 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2539596 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2539597 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2539598 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2539599 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2539600 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2539601 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2539602 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2539603 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2539604 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2539605 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2539606 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2539607 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2539608 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2539615 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2539616 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2539617 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2539618 i tested the purebuds with my ipod classic and compared them to stock iphone earbuds as that is what i use all the time using the surround sound ear tip i could tell a definite improvement in sound quality i wouldnt say that it music sounds 3d but with this tip music does have more texture and sparkle as far as comfort i can wear the purebuds with this tip without any discomfort

2539625 america itself lost much of its will to fight and the politicians and the press began their program of vilification
2539626 a dangerous strategic diversion of limited u s military capabilities to a non decisive theatre
2539627 absurd to think that a nation of 20 million people can be subverted by 15 20 thousand active guerrillas if the government and the people of that country do not wish to be subverted
2539628 70 to avoid a humiliating us defeat to our reputation as a guarantor
2539629 total victory in some situations would be an unreasonable goal
2539630 i am not going to be the president who saw southeast asia go the way china went
2539631 is that the appetite of aggression is never satisfied to withdraw from one battlefield means only to prepare for the next
2539632 there would follow in this country an endless national debate a mean and destructive debate that would shatter my presidency kill my administration and damage our democracy
2539633 take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack and to prevent further aggression
2539634 to pacify the republic of south vietnam by destroying the vc his forces organization terrorists agents and propagandists while at the same time reestablishing the government apparatus strengthening gvn military forces rebuilding the administrative machinery and re instituting the services of the government during this process security must be provided to all of the people on a progressive basis
2539635 we are not engaging the vc with sufficient frequency or effectiveness to win the war in vietnam
2539636 i dont think the whole of southeast asia as related to the present and future safety and freedom of the people of this country is worth the life and limb of a single american
2539637 i dont believe there is a win option in vietnam
2539638 get the people by the balls and their hearts and minds will follow
2539639 by god they sent us over here to kill communists and thats what were doing
2539640 there was no pattern to these patrols and operations without a front flanks or rear we fought a formless war against a formless enemy who evaporated like the morning jungle mists only to materialize in some unexpected place

2539649 king kel will have a chance to make those decisions tomorrow in louisville
2539650 what do you think ted daniels got left by the regular train and i had to get a special engine and coach to bring him on here from louisville and the railroad company charged me 300 but he will be here in time to umpire tomorrows game
2539651 what is getting into you kelly was all right and here you are making a laughing stock of yourself by paying a railroad company 300 dollars to bring a man here who should have been left in louisville
2539652 we cant stop the train now for daniels has certainly started but you see the advertisement we will get out of it by paying 300 for a special train to bring an umpire to st louis

2539656 there was this amazing feeling in the atmosphere and there were just hundreds of people who worked so hard put their heart and soul in it to make it look the way that it did all of that together was just incredibly emotional
2539657 i think it was important for the chinese to have an international artist involved and for me it felt right to have an international face in there
2539658 it is wonderful to have a surprise especially when the people putting it on have put so much into it you have to respect their wishes

2539673 demand for gold has been resilient to global market conditions despite high volatility in prices gold trade through dubai continued to surge reiterating the emirates prominence as a global centre for gold and precious metals
2539674 the sharp rise in prices seen earlier this year has been a prime driver in improving export volumes and has boosted the role of gold as an inflation hedging instrument
2539675 however with new developments in europe being delayed and new regulations limiting land sales in china this sector may soon experience the same declining investment other property types have
2539676 we expect the market to calm down over the next one to two years but after that the situation will probably become more strained again
2539677 only the opec nations are able to boost capacity in an meaningful way
2539678 we will in any case not experience again a price level of 20 a barrel as it was 10 years ago

2539680 what the heck i was immediately deluged with repeated requests to pass on introductions through my network

2539682 i did have a linkedin connection contact me recently asking for a referral to a company on my list i didnt even realize i had a connection with the company i was able to make an email introduction and the two of them are now doing business it was as simple as this guy searching his linkedin connections to see if anyone had a connection to his targeted prospect
2539683 i really love linkedin but its done nothing for me sales wise
2539684 if i listed off what i believed and what i didnt believe no christian would say i was a christian
2539685 its just a distinction that i just dont care about anymore am i a christian am i not it doesnt matter to me
2539686 we have a really sweet rapport she knows this isnt some sort of posturing me saying i dont believe in god anymore
2539687 in regards to ellanor our daughter weve been really careful i would prefer she wouldnt know any bible stories or know about jesus and yet thats whats going to happen
2539688 but im cool knowing that shell be hopefully in a situation where shes not forced to assume certain things are true and shes given space to make her decisions about stuff like that much later

2539696 rather than engage speech that strays too far from the dangerously narrow borders of our public discourse the gatekeepers of that discourse our mass media tend to effectively shout it down marginalize it or ignore it
2539697 a danger that the subtleties of the science and its uncertainty might be missed by reporters unfamiliar with the territory

2539700 a meteorologist at cbss chicago station did a special report that featured local scientists discussing the hazards of global warming in one segment well known national skeptics in another and ended with a cop out what is the truth about global warming
2539701 he said she said but he or she is wrong and here is the correct way to think
2539702 the era of equal time for skeptics who argue that global warming is just a result of natural variation and not human intervention seems to be largely over except on talk radio cable and local television

2539712 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2539713 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights
2539714 instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
2539715 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2539716 that failure has damaged the prospects for a legacy of enhanced media freedom greater tolerance for dissent and respect for the rule of law
2539717 when you come to the olympic games in beijing you may not know that the flowers smiles harmony and prosperity are built on a base of grievances tears imprisonment torture and blood
2539718 the crackdown on activists the increase in evictions the harassment of journalists and the sweeps from beijing are all worsening because of the olympics
2539719 only by releasing these people and ending this intimidation can the chinese government and the ioc salvage the integrity of the olympics

2539722 kami memperkirakan permintaan para investor perorangan terhadap reksa dana akan sangat dipengaruhi oleh pasar finansial yang sangat berfluktuasi hal ini akan membawa dampak buruk bagi bisnis ritel kami
2539723 kami akan terus mendapatkan berita dari sektor perbankan yang keadaannya tidak lagi terlalu buruk hal itu dapat dilihat dalam dua sisi yakni kinerja perbankan memang tidak baik dan prospek ke depan masih saja gelap akan tetapi di sisi lain pasar dapat berbalik mendadak jika kinerja keuangan membaik sehingga kita dapat merasakan sedikit dampak positif di pasar saham hari ini
2539724 itu sebabnya kami kini tidak lagi menyubsidi harga bahan bakar minyak dan transportasi tetapi mulai menerapkan antara lain program kesejahteraan pekerja

2539731 mijn werk kun je zien als een dialoog met huidige maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen waarin als antwoord op de overheersende seculiere levensopvatting de kracht van het geestelijke steeds meer erkenning vraagt in mijn werk objectiveer ik deze geestelijke kracht ik laat zien dat de geest werkzaam is in het kwantummechanische veld daarnaast laat ik zien dat de individuele geest geen volledige controle heeft over dit verschijnsel en slechts in beperkte mate de fysieke realiteit kan sturen dit maant tot zekere bescheidenheid het zichtbaar maken van deze vraagstukken op een conceptueel doorwrochte en heldere manier geeft een nieuwe impuls tot reflectie voor iedereen die zingeving ontleent aan de overtuiging dat de geest de oorsprong van onze fysieke realiteit is
2539732 yet another step we are taking to help the noreve brand become one of the most unique and recognized case manufacturers in the world

2539737 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible

2539743 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2539744 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2539745 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2539746 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2539747 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2539748 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear

2539750 for the first time in quite a while ive actually been happy with the set up of the car
2539751 it feels good we didnt change much between the two qualifying sessions and i doubt well make many for the race we were just unfortunate not to be able to get a lap in at the end
2539752 there was so little time after the red flag and i just couldnt get the best out of the tyres in that time it was like driving on ice having said all that this is the sort of race where anything can happen so were looking forward to a strong race tomorrow

2539771 i can say what i need to say you dont get anywhere with the two major parties unless you sell yourself to them i was willing to do that in 2006 because i still believed in their message and that they were serious about getting us out of iraq i really did i was take in i was very angry when pelosi took all of that off the table it was the clincher for me the democrats dont want people who think for themselves they want people who they can control just like the republicans do people who think for themselves dont make it in the two major parties

2539787 20 years after i first testified before congress on the threats posed by climate change we have reached a point at which we must remove unnecessary carbon emissions from our lives or face catastrophic consequences it is hard to imagine waste more unnecessary than the 100 billion pieces of junk mail americans receive each year and these new findings revealing that the emissions of junk mail are equal to those of over nine million cars underscore the prudent necessity of a do not mail registry

2539814 there is no despair so absolute as that which comes from the first moments of our first great sorrow when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and healed to have despaired and recovered hope

2539821 my family and i thought a lot about whether the movie should be released or not it would lead to their arrest and detention but dhondup considered showing it to the world very important
2539822 i hope the film becomes a channel for those inside tibet and their voices dont go unheard

2539828 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2539829 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2539830 the world is watching china today as the olympics begin and with this action the voices of the tibetan people will be heard despite the best attempts of the chinese authorities to silence them
2539831 the chinese government will not be allowed to use the olympics to hide the reality of its harsh rule inside tibet
2539832 these activists have delivered a message of solidarity with the tibetan people highlighting the grave situation in tibet just moments before the beijing olympics began
2539833 the chinese government wants the world to be dazzled and distracted by the grandeur of the opening ceremony but its true face can be seen in its ruthless and intensifying repression of the tibetan people

2539858 each time the mayor opted to drive back sometimes to enjoy the company of family members but other times because he simply enjoys the solitude of driving
2539859 each trip was court approved within the court approved timeframe albeit through different jurisdictions and was the most direct route back to detroit
2539860 i dont know what the circumstances were but i cant imagine that this is a problem
2539861 the mayor was approved for a business trip to upper new york state in mid july so this may be related i dont think this a matter where anyone is thinking he was getting away with anything
2539862 i think its a situation that the authorities will take a close look at to see if true and if he was given permission
2539863 he was only asked where are you going and when are you coming back there was no requirement to explain how are you getting there how are you getting back
2539864 he may have gone through niagara falls on the way back i believe the most direct route back to detroit is driving through canada
2539865 he saw me staring at him and i said mayor kilpatrick he got up and shook my hand
2539866 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2539867 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private

2539896 karma means its your responsibility for what you have done and what you have never done in the world why is that so because you are yourself and also the rest of mankind at the same time

2539898 have you seen what faithless israel has done she has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there i thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not and her unfaithful sister judah saw it i gave faithless israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries yet i saw that her unfaithful sister judah had no fear she also went out and committed adultery because israels immorality mattered so little to her she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood in spite of all this her unfaithful sister judah did not return to me with all her heart but only in pretense
2539899 because israels immorality mattered so little to her she defiled the land and committed adultery idolatry with graven images out of stone and wood

2539906 sudah saatnya mengakhiri perang di irak dengan meminta pihak irak mengambil tanggung jawab bagi masa depan mereka dan menanam modal di negeri mereka sendiri
2539907 negeri kami telah menghabiskan hampir satu triliun dolar di irak bahkan tatkala sekaloh sekolah kami kekurangan dana jalan jalan dan jembatan jembatan tak terurus dan harga segala barang mulai dari kebutuhan dan segalon gas naik
2539908 sekarang pikirkan sejenak tentang apa yang kita telah lakukan dengan ratusan dan ratusan miliar dolar yang kita habiskan di irak
2539909 kita bisa membangun kembali sekolah jalan jalan dan jembatan jembatan amerika
2539910 many of us familiar with hillary clintons approach to achieving her goals refused to believe that she ever gave up all hope of winning the nomination and the presidency her words and actions on the subject of the convention itself always left the door open for a return should obama falter or suffer some calamity
2539911 it looks like obamas belief in his inevitability may have led him into a blunder making it easier for hillary supporters to prevent a nomination on the first ballot after that point anything goes as all super delegates and many pledged delegates are free to vote their preferences
2539912 kalau merpati mengoperasikan pesawat baling baling atau jet kso kami harap bisa langsung positif cashflow nya selama ini semua pesawat baling baling untung kebetulan kami memang butuh perkuat terus armada yang fixed wing baling baling
2539913 kalau dari jakarta ke medan terbang 1 5 jam cuma rp400 ribu itu 1 5 jam terbang mereka bisa rp800 ribu tetapi di tempat itu memang tak bisa menerbangkan pesawat besar karena bandaranya terbatas
2539914 sebenarnya mereka tahun 2002 sudah minta modal negara dan baru dapat 2007 setelah 38 kali rapat dapat rp450 miliar namun karena sudah sekian tahun bermasalah begitu dapat ya habis saja seperti buang uang ke laut karena itu kali ini harus selesai insya allah
2539915 the president was referring to efforts online to pressure superdelegates in support of sen obama
2539916 let the voters decide between clinton and obama then support the peoples choice
2539917 im not jumping out of this until the inauguration and even then i wont be gracious
2539918 its an encouraging sign that the campaign is making progress and the superdelegates are moving in our direction
2539919 is getting ex back possible or should i just move on
2539920 party out of time is it 2008 1950 or 1939
2539921 the republican brand has been so badly damaged that if the republicans try to run an anti obama anti reverend wright campaign they are simply going to fail
2539922 the republican brand is in the trash can ive often observed that if we were a dog food they would take us off the shelf
2539923 i have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on
2539924 found how senator obamas support among working hard working americans white americans is weakening again and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me
2539925 look matey i know a dead parrot when i see one and im looking at one right now
2539926 no no hes not dead hes hes resting remarkable bird the norwegian blue isnt it aye beautiful plumage
2539927 look matey i know a dead parrot when i see one and im looking at one right now
2539928 no no hes not dead hes hes resting remarkable bird the norwegian blue isnt it aye beautiful plumage
2539929 i think senator clintons leadership on advocacy and choice issues is second to none
2539930 im afraid that america isnt ready for a black man
2539931 rev wright is as bad as hitler even though obama has condemned the remarks of his former pastor and no one can find any statement by obama supporting the rev wrights views obama must therefor like hitler
2539932 yes we have no morals we have no morals today
2539933 terrorists and radicals was no different than appeasing hitler and the nazis
2539934 yes there have been appeasers in the past and the president is exactly right and one of them is neville chamberlain mr
2539935 i believe that its not an accident that our hostages came home from iran when president reagan was president of the united states he didnt sit down in a negotiation with the religious extremists in iran he made it very clear that those hostages were coming home
2539936 we need to figure out a way to develop some leverage and then sit down and talk with them
2539937 if there is going to be a discussion then they need something too we cant go to a discussion and be completely the demander with them not feeling that they need anything from us
2539938 the republican brand has been so badly damaged that if the republicans try to run an anti obama anti reverend wright campaign they are simply going to fail
2539939 party leaders speak of the need to refurbish the republican brand the problem goes far beyond packaging though its not that the box needs to be more colorful its that the ideas inside have long since gone stale
2539940 in this spring of discontent republicans are turning on each other because even their best news is bad news
2539941 senator clinton did not get out of the night what she needed
2539942 to use a basketball analogy she traded baskets and she needed to do much better than that this late in the contest with her down 150 or 160 pledged delegates
2539943 even during the period post pennsylvania during reverend wright we decisively won superdelegates in that period
2539944 and if theyre not going to make up significant ground during that period its hard to see how things are going to change
2539945 this is now hurting the party and whoever will be the nominee in the fall
2539946 were going to argue that its going to take 2 209 to get to the magic number were going to argue that florida and michigan need to be seated full strength
2539947 and as the results in indiana demonstrated voters are rewarding senator clinton with victories even in states senator obama predicted victory in
